XI BARBADOS Exceptionally, the Rawlinson correspondence for I 686-8 includes some letters received from Barbados, these three from tbe Company's agents there, Edwyn Steed and Stephen Gascoigne (of whom the former was also Governor of Barbados); and two others (nos 901-2, above) from an RAC ship arr.iving there from West Africa. This correspondence from Barbados to Cape Coast Castle evidently depended on ships returning directly from the West Indies to Africa, rather than undertaking the 'triangular' voyage via England, and this direct trade was clearly at this period still unusual, and had been pioneered by interlopers rather than by the RAC itself.1 Indeed, it is probable that the three ships which carried the following letters were the only ships of the Company which sailed from Barbados to Africa during the period of this cotTespondence.2 These letters provide interesting supplementary material on the delivery of slaves to the West Indies, including local planter preferences for slaves of particular ethnicities, and on the supply of West Indian produce such as rum in the African trade. 973. Edwyn Steed & Stephen Gascoigne Barbadoes , 12 May 1686 Your severall letters by sundrey ships comes to our hands, vizt yours of the 4th August by Captain Hobs we received the 2gthJanuary; 15 of October per Captain 19thMasters the 23d January; of October per the Goodfellowship, Captain 19thRobson, the second March; of November by Captain Nanter, the 23d Aprill; of primo December, by Captain Gold the 201h March; of the 9 December by Captain Crookshanks, the 30th March. Captain Hobs and Captain Nanter being both very heavy dull sailors, had long and tedious passage, and which was worse, both ships happen 'd to be much vissit'd with the small pox, which with the fflux, the usual! distemper of a long voyage, carrid of nigh ninty of the Negroes per Captain Hobs, and nigh half of those of Captain N anter. 3 The few that were left in both ships were most of them in low condition, so yeilded but a low price. Those per Captain Hobbs, by you stild good Gold Coast Negroes, we here found not to be so, but of severall nations and languages, as Alampo , the worst of Negroes, Papas and some of unknown parts, and few right Gold Coast Negroes amongst them, which are here presently now discern'd by every planter or inhabitant of this island from any other sort of Negroes. 4 The generallity of people here haveing of late years sufficiently paid for such their knowledge are no longer to be deceiv'd theirin. We also observe you send some old Negroes , gray headed, and some very small chilldren , nither of which will here scarce yeild the freight to be pai.d for or what their passage amounts to. It were better to lett you know, that the like may be avoyd'd for the future. According to your desire we have here assist'd and furnished Captain Hobs with all nessessarys request'd for his return to you. The ship hath cost a great deal more mony and took up much longer time to reffit than could be immagind , amounts to 343£: 10s: lld sterling as per the inclosed account, which is £9: 4s for eight barrels of beeff which the ships company are to make good to you. Thereby you will se all that hath been fumish'd here and what wages paid the Master and men and accordingly you may accompt for them there. We wish the ships future good servis may repay the great cost on her. By the inclos'd bill of loading and invoyce you will see we have ship'd the rum and sugar desir'd per yours of the 19th December , which we hope will arrive you in safty and to a good markett. All possib le care hath been taken in the goodness of the caske, which we hope will prevent leakage and any the least then abouts [sic]. The like care shall be taken in what is to goe on Captain Nanter, who is now fitting and may be ready to take in goods in 15 or twenty day[s]. We have orderd the rum cask to be made less than those now sent on Captain Hobbs , and had you mention'd the size you would have them of they should have been so made. We could gett but two hogsheads of white sugar ready for Captain Hobbs , the other two hogshead are very goodMusco(vado] sugar, which we are told will sell well with you. What will send per Captain Nanter shall be all white as you write for. 974. Edwyn Steed & Stephen Gascoigne Barbadoes , l July 1686 The foregoing is a copy of our last sent per Captain Hobbs. This serves cheifly to accompany the Affrican Marchant , Captain George Nanter Comander, who has spent much time and expended much mony in refitting his ship, the perticulars of all which you will find in his inclosed and account of his disburstments , of the justice of which you will be better able to judge then wee, especially in what relates to the seamens wages, and his expences and disburstments at Princes, of which we know nothing but as he informes us, and therefore could take noe other measures in furnishing him with monys but as he demanded it. We hope the ship will doe the Company considerable servis, and so answer the cost has been expended on her. What allowance the Captain is to have for the victualling his ship here we know not, not being privy to what contract you have made with him about it, and therefore must refer that also to your consideration, and adjustment. According to your desires we have shipt the sugar and rum you write for on the Company account, as appears per the inclos'd invoyce and bill of loading, all which we hope will come safe and in good condition to you, being excellen t good in their kinds and as well put in good caskes as is possible to be done, which we hope will encourage you to write to the Company to order considerable supplyes of mm to be sent you from this place, we being told per them that has had large experience of it, that it sells to the natives as redily and for as much as brandy , which if it doe must be of great proffitto the Company to make use ofit rather then brandy, since it cost not much above a third part of what brandy stands them. 5 ln all the convenience we shall have by it, is to advance the Company intrest, and to help make returns to them, it being now very difficult to make large and good returns, from hence to England. 6 Yours of the twentieth of Ffebruary per the Orangtree, and of the ffirst of March per the Mary are now with us, those two ships arriveing here the twenty ninth past , haveing had great mortallity among their negroes, each ship haveing lost about one hundred of what they took in. The rest have had the flux and are in very poor and mean condition, the small pox also being very much on board the Mary, which will binder their sales, and we fear make them come out at very low rates, ifwe can sell them at all, this island haveing for eighteen months last past paid very dear for pocky Negroes, import'd here by an interloper, in the loss of many thousand slaves, besides abundance of our white people, to the great weakening and impoverish of our island, soe that we are in great streight what we shall doe with the Marys Negroes, and indeed them per the Orangetree are so poor and bad that nobody rares [ sic: =dares?] to goe on board to buy any. We therefore earnestly recomend it to you for the future , as one of the greatest services can be done the Company, that you will send us as many good Gold Coast and Cormanteen Negroes 7 as possible can be gott, those comeing alwaies in good condition , also well accepted here, but we pray you by noe means to send Allampoes , for they are so bad and so well known here that, let them come in what condition they will, they will scarce sell at any price. Wee observe what you write concerning Mr Bayly and Mr Standleys imbeazleing goods on board the prizes taken per Captain Bridges, and would be glad we could return any thing from them for the Company, but Bayly is dead , and Standly utterly denies that ever it was in his power to imbezle anything , for that he was never imployd but in one ship, that bad noe goods on board but a little iron and red wood, which he deliverd at Cabo Corso as he receiv'd it, and dares averr that Agent Nurse nor any of the Councill ever chargd him with any such misdemeanor, and seams to be much surpris'd to meet with this account and carrecter ofhimselfe here. We have not further to add but referr matters of news to Mr Elwaies , who is an intelligent man and to whome we have given liberty to take on board such reffreshments ofwynes and other things as Agent Nurse orderd him to procure for him, and we have also permitted some tokens to be put on board the ship, which some people have sent to their relations on the Coast for refreshment, which are not much, besides what are sent to Mr Carter 8 for houshold stuff, house keeping and refreshment. 975. Edwin Steed Barbados , 6 Aprill 1687 Your severall letters per Captain Wood, Captain Poston, Captain Butram and Captain Nant er are now come to my hands, which I take this oppertunity to acquaint you off, having no other means of sending to you but returne of the Coast Ffriggatt , Captain Wood, whose Negroes came in pretty good condition, and yielded [a] price suitable, as they will always doe, that come from your parts, that is to say, from the Gold Coast, iftbey be well sorted, young and come in a healthy condition , as Captain Butrams also did, which were sold here in a litle time , and at a very high price , but Captain Poston and Captain Nanter had not that good luck , for besides the mortality that was among them, they came so full of the small pox that wee could find no custom for them, even at the lowest rate, so that many of Nanters remayne yet unsold, and it bas spread that disease exceedingly in the country to the great damage and discouragement of all future sales of sick and pocky Negroes. Your not giving me any encouragement to returne Captain Nanter to you, and the Company thinking the last repairing of her was very costly, though the greatest part of the money was for seamens wages, which must have been paid if she had not been sent to you, I shall therefore follow their orders about that shipp, in disposing of her here the best I can, for I find she will cost more money to fitt her for another Guinea voyage than did last time, and though the Coast Friggatt has cost now in repayres about one hundred and fifty pounds, besides other insidents and wages due, amounting to in the whole three hundred, twenty and four pounds , ten shilling and six pence, halfpenny, as per the inclosed accompt appears, yet I hope, God sending her safe to you, her service will pay her charge with good proffitt to the Company. By her I send you invoyce and bi II of loading for fifty two puncheons , twelve hogsheads and twenty four tierces of rumrn, and though it exceeds what you writt for in quantity, yet considering the freight cost nothing, and that every one that comes thence assures me it is a very proffitable comodity for the Company on all the Coast, and being now very good, and at a moderate price, though growing very deare, I was willing to take this oppertunuty of shewing my diligence and care in the Companyes service, and I hope they and you will account it so in this particular. Captain Wood carried himself very well in this voyage, and I hope at his returne to you, will deserve the continuance of your favour to him, and if you see no objection against him, I conceive if you retume the the shipp with slaves he may be fitly trusted with that charge, if you find any error in his accompts, as to seamens wages or otherw ise, you will be better able rectifie it, by your books, than I cou.ld here, though I hope there is no error in it, though I have by me the papers you sent me thereto relating. I have spoke to Captain Nanter about the error that happened in your accomp ts with him to your damage, upwards of two ounces of gold. He seems to know nothing of it, but he says be will overlooke bis accompts and give me further answer therein, but I will certain.ly make stoppage of so much money for you, whether he owns the truth or not, till the Agent Generall may call here in his way home,9 or that I have further advise from yourselves. Wee have litle news here, only all country comoditys sell very low in England, 10 and by that means the people here are very backward in paying what they owe the Company. 11 All things are very peaceable in Europe, no warrs being there like to be but between the Emperor and the Turk. 12
