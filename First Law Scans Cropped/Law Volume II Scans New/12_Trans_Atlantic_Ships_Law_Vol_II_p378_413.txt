TRANS-ATLANTIC VOYAGES The Mary , Commander John Carter [The Mary was expected at Sekondi from mid-Jan. 1686 (nos 4-6), but did not call there, in consequence of being attacked by a pirate , as follows.] 898. John Carter Accra , 24 Jan . 1685/6 This is to acquaint you of our arrivall at Accra. We was chast down by two pyrats tbat was at Axim. One of them we have been in fight with at Cape Mountsaradoe, 65 and put him to the worst of it, soe much that he ran away from us. His consorte is a Dutch man that he has taken upon the coast, and maned with his own men. They chast us so far of, that the ffirst land we could come in with was Lague. I beleive the pyrates are gone to windward againe, for he finding we could wrong bis consort, he would not venture upon us, but in the night we lost him. I expect him down every hower. I wish we had but a consorte , then he would not come near us, for he will not meddle with us by himselfe, and if I had but another ship in company , I would not question but to take his consort or both of them. Ifhe comes down we must be fforst to come into the shoar, as near as we can to the Castle. Maddam Nurse 66 and all your children was very well when l came out of England. {From Accra, Carter made his way back up the coast , stopping at Anomabu to take in com (cf. nos 386-7).] 899. John Carter [Anomabu] , from on Board of the Mary, 15 Feb. 1685/6 I have been here to leward 3 dayes and have not purchased but a hundred chests of come. The Negroes promis fair but performed little, which makes me fear I shall be a long time a purchaseing my come. Mr Nightingale 67 desires your Worships order to put aboard of us what come he can spare above the 43 7 chests which is at Annamaboe and the 300 chests that is at Agga, and what more he can purchase at l.a per chest. Mr Nightingale is very kind and doth assist me very much in buying my come . [By 18 Feb., Carter had his complement of com, and intended to proceed from Anomabu to Cape Coast (no.388). He then went east down the coast to Whydah. Carter himself died at Whydah, 12 April 1686, and the Mary departed from there 17 April (no. 815), and arrived in Barbados , 29 June 1686 (no.974).] The African Merchant, Commander George Nanter [Nanter had left Cape Coast , bound for Barbados, in Nov . 1685 (no.973). Robert Elwes , the author of two of these letters , accompanied him as factor.] 900. Robert Elwes [Cape Lopez] , 31 Jan . 1686 This accompanys the Dutch sloop whom we met with of Cape Lopas and bound for the Mine.

We lost our carpenter in ffew dayes affter we came from Whiddah. We have had a sickly ship, yet I thank God all indefferent. Mr Nanter bas been very ill but recover'd, is still very weak . We have heitherto met with small winds, and our ship a heavy saylor. We have lost a great many Negroes with the small pox, it being very breife [sic] amounst them . This in bast. 901. George Nanter Barbadoes , 10 May 1686 This comes by Mr Hobs. I had sent to your Worship from Cape Lopas , but at the present I was very ill , not able to write, but I hope Mr Elwes did give a full account of our proceedings. These are to give your Worship an account of our tedious passage from Cape Lopas to the Island of Barbados , which was two months and twenty dayes. We arriv'd the 22d of Aprill, in which passage we lost 123 negroes. The cheif distemper was the small pox and ffiux and discentory. Inthe road we lost five more, and one we paid at Princes for custom, for in all 129, and we brought away from Wbidda 279, it being all that our goods would purchase , 72 and we sayld uv,11 vvwuu<111 ,u" JV v, .u1;1,;1::111ut:r m Lncevening. 1..,aptamUunsteed died andCaptain Ware arrived at Spites73 the 4th of May in the evening, and [said] thatCaptain Low saild from Whiddah three weeks before him; but they did not touchhere, and Mr Ware gave us an account that the pyrate had taken a Dutch interloper and 120 marke of gold in bim; and the merchant of the Dutchman told him thatPlatt was made Commander of their ship, and that Platt was worse to them than theFrench man.74 This is to give your Worship an account that we are a ffitting theship with all expedition to return for Cabo Corso, which I hope to be ready to saylefrom hence per the latter end of June. I give your Worship many thanks for all theffavours that I did receive from your Worships hands while J was at Cabo Corso.

I give your Worship thanks for the recommendation you wereplcas'd to oblidge me with to Mr Hardin, from whom I have received all theimmaginable kindness that could be expected.

John Coll ins 6 Feb. 1686 After my departure from your Worsb i p our first pl ace for slaves was Kitto, w(h ]ere found Captain Paine rideing and be bad purcbasd one hundred and fifty slaves , which made me stop expecting of a quick dispatch , but finding small trade I put Mr Bodk in on board, being his des ire and Capta in Pain es. I went to Whiddah , and in 3 weeks time was dispatch , but tbe wetber proveing bad I could not gett of. On the 26th of November came in Mr Robson. Captain Pain on the 29th goeing on shore , haveing received some abuse from the Negroes at Kitto, he, his Doctor , Mr Bodkin, boatswane, gunner his(= gunner's] mate, cooper and 4 men more were all cut in peices. 3 ofhis long boat crew got on board but wounded. 75 December the 1st l sayled from Whiddah, and was a month to the Cape, 76 put out and forc't to St Thoma, I haveing all that time much sickness, and now since my comeing from St Thoma a relapse and dangerously ill, but meeting your kinsman here Mr Here.ford77 I thought conve nient to give your Worship this account, being the first I beleive you wil here of the accident. My slaves stand very well, but my vessell sayles extraordinary beavy. I beg you would be soe kind as to write to the Company of the delivery of my gould , I now haveing lost my rece ipts, but how 1010wnot. The Sarah Bonadventure , Comman der Thomas Woodfine , then Thomas Attwell [Woodfine left England in Dec. 1685, with instructions to trade for gold, ivory and pepper , and for slaves to take to Jamaica ;78 he arrived at Sekondi 17 Apri l I 686 (no.25). ] 904. Thomas W oodfine Annnamaboe , 16 May 1686 Yours rece ived, and am very s ncible of the times of the years spending and how that Captain Walker is soon ffollowing, but I can in noewise help itt by reason of want of com. Two dayes noe corn caused by the pallaver, 79 and since it was ended have received from Annamaboe 80 chests and Agga I 96 ditto, here being not one chest left. This I thought to advise by Captain Butler, who comes to Cabo Corso tomorrow. I have been with all the Capuishers in both towns, and they say they have anuff but not at the former prizes. How it comes to be rais'd I know not, for there is difference between two ffactors at Agga, 80 for had not Mr Nightingale sent his five hand canoe to Agga to assist mine we should not gett of any com in length of time. Thus wishing your Worships good health, doubting not but that your Worship thinks I will make all dispatch I can.  PS. Captain Butler hath received from Annamaboe  180 Chests  100 Chests from Agga  280  [lnclosure]  I am but just now arriv'd, but by what I can understand their are some annimositys betwixt the two ffactorys [sic: = factors], which tomorrow I shall inquire into the cause and give your Worship an account, which I beleive is the occasion of their detainment so long by reason of advancement of come, which is occasion' d by, as Captain Woodfine informs me, their difference. I shall doe all that in me lyes to serve them, and to accommodate all difference, that so they may have a speedy dispatch. Annamaboe Sunday 6 a clock in the affternoon John Boylstone [Woodfine apparently went east to Cape Coast, before returning to Anom.abu, to take in the remainder of his com ( cf. nos 411-17)]. 905. Thomas Woodfine Annamaboe, IO June 1686 Yours received, and for all kindnesses received I return your Worship hearty thanks and in this small matter that you have thought fitt for me to send your Worship, ware it ten times as much should readily be obeyd. At my arrivall here yesterday noon sent my long boat with my mate in her, and the sea goeing so great could not gett of any com, but I came this morning on shore with our great cano, and shall I hope send of near all our com for ourselves and Mr Whiteing, which will be thirty chests for him. 81 And as to the hats I know not what price to put on them, for think to deliver them at home. I think, had not Mr Boylston sent the slaves from Agga, might a been a great hindrance to our dispatch, but God willing will say! a Sattrday, and if any further servis to com and shal! be glad to serve your Worship. [Woodfine proceeded to Wbydah, to take in slaves, but died there before his ship departed (nos 818, 824); command of the shjp was taken over by Thomas Attwell, who completed the voyage to Jamaica. 82] The Mayflower , Commander Nehemiah Walker [Walker had arrived on the coast by 18 April 1686 (no.400). On 7 May he was at Sekondi, and went down from there to Komenda (no.28) .] 906. Nehemiah Walker from on Board the Mayflower, 25 May 1686 Haveing taken phisick today am much indispos'd. If you think itt convenient I would desire your Worships favour to spare me one of the young men in Mr Hassells room to assist me, I baveing never seen one of those accounts made up before and may be occasion of being noe mistake. Pray pardon this troble. 907. Nehemiah Walker Annamaboe, 2 June 1686 We have on board about fifty chests of com, and should have more had not the weather hindred.83 Mr Nightingale is very carefull in our dispatch, and ifwe have good weather shall not be Jong before I wait on you at Caho Corso. [After calling at Cape Coast, Walker again proceeded east, calling at Anomabu later in June J686 (no.4 I 9). He eventually proceeded to take in slaves at Wbydah, from where he intended to Jamaica (nos 819, 822).] The Hunter, Commander Peter Pickard [Pickard was expected at the Gambia in March 1686 (no.I), was off Axim, 18-20 May (nos 836-7), and arrived at Sekondi, and from there to Komenda, on 25 May (nos 30, 159).] 908. Petter Pickard Commendo road, 31 May 1686 I have according to order sent the 4 bayles of perpetuanoes, which I hope will safe arrive with you, for the boat man saith be can carry them with conveniency. I have sent down my mate two day es since to se if be can purchase from 2 to 400 chests of come at Dickeecove , where 2 was offe rd at 1 .a but my people that doe know com better than me told me it was not so good as I should gett below, which occasione 'd my neglect in corning their. My sayes stick on hand yett and powder and cases of liquor, all elce I shall dispose of though at low rates. God knows I wish I had brought blew perpetuanoes in leiw, for they were fitt to eat me for them after broak price for 2 blew and one green for 9a per peice, ifl had sold the blew single 2 could gett for them [sic]. The sloop was in sight of this place yesterday at her return, if se her I shall comply with your order in sending the goods down. [In June 1686, Pickard was at Anomabu, taking in com (nos 417,422, 433).] The Jeffery, 84 Commander Benjamin Daley [Daley was reported to be lying between Cape Three Points and Axim, 21 Aug. 1686 (no.46)] 909. Benjamin Daile Dicke Cove, rideing , 22 Aug. 1686 In answer of yours of the 19th instant and am very glad to here of your good health, and doe humbly thank your Honer for your advise. l have had a very small trade for teeth and gold in the ship. I doe intend to make the best of my way to Commenda, for I find very small incouragement here. The sea runs so high that canos cannot come on board. I humbly thank your Honour and Councill that you are pleas'd to take care for my slaves to windward. 85 910. Benjamin Daille Buteru, rideing, 23 Aug. 1686 Meeting with the bearer thought fitt to give your Honour account of my proceeding. 86 I doe find noe trade at Dickecove, nor Buterue.

George Poston Commenda , 23 Aug. 1686 I must begg that favour at your hands to pardon me in not sending the packett by my chururgeon, which bath trobl' d me very much ever since, being I never thought ofit to send it affter my boate, not tell such time I received your Worships letter this morning. Therefore pardon me for I was so busy at Taggarado that I thought nothing but that I had sent it, for I orderd my young man to fetch all the letter[ s] in such a place to me and I made them up, but little I thought I had left out the main business. I have sent in my long boate with 4 hogshead of strong bear [= beer] for your Worship; likewise 8 bales ofperpetuanoes for your Castle . Your Worship was pleased to write to me for a sample of sum stuffs or silks and for two or three pairs ofshoues, but I am sorry I cannot pleasure your Worship with any of those things ; but I have sent your Worship one pair sbooes which was made for my self and 1 have not one new pair more in the ship, or elce I would pleasure your Worship with them . May it please your Worship that here Captain Brandfei ld hath sold perpetuanoes at 9a and sayes at 13a; but all this day I can't gett no trade except I lower the price, so haveing some green perpetuanoes and this night I have already sold them for 9a perpet1ianoe and 12a for sayes, so I would have your Worship advice, for they will have every thing lowerd sumthing less than Captain Brandfeild bas had, and will expecially when Captain Deal comes down to us, which I suppose will be in a daye or two more. May it please your Worship that I would have your Worships advice in every thing, by reason I have been 31 dayes upon tbe Coast already and have toucht at all places in generall upon the Coast, but could not gett but little trade, and to sattisfie your Worship that my owners batb noe part of my windward cargo , butt though they have not I will doe as mucb for the Royall Company as any man that ever was in there imploy to the utmost of my power.

As for my bale of green perpetuanoes I will assure your Worship that I shall make some stir about it, when if please God to spare me life till I come home, for I know nothing but that they were all blew, for I indent 'd for none but blew. Likewise when I came out, I was told by them that put them up, that I had none but blew , so of all that I sold in every chest there was none but blew. Likewise these two chests prov ' d to be the last chests that was opend in the ship, and I had sold them both for blew but they prov'd both to be green, which doth vex me to the heart for to se it, but I have put some of them of for come at Sa per peice. Fformerly when I was on the Coast in this ship we had in eve1y bale a few green and redd, and now I think it was very indisscreetly done for to put them in bayles per themselves. As for pewter, powder, knives, marble clouts, birds eye carpitts, flowerd longees, iron barrs, and powder [sic] I have dispos 'd of none as yett. [Poston was still at Komenda, 3 Sept. 1686, trying to obtain com (no.177).] 914.

One of your cask is leakt out, which I canot help. When you have received pray give the bill of loading to my boatswane and a receipt for the passengers . I desire you not to troble your selfe to buy any corn for mee, for I can buy corn at Commenda while I am selling my goods. I have received little mony as yett. The Negroes ask only for blew perpetuanoes. [Brandfill was apparently still at Sekondi, 21-23 Aug. (nos 46--7), but moved on from there to Komenda, where he took in a slave (no.176).] 916.

The same ship as the Dutch informd me of when I was on my windward voyage 91 has been here and bumd the town the most part down and plundered the most part of the island,92 and now is gon to Cape Lopez, I understand bound for the Coast againe.

We are come one bad disaster, that is by fireing three guns one of our men broak his arme, but I hope he'! recover againe, his name is John Barber, but I bless God all our people is well besides, but our ship sayles very heavy and I am afrajd of a long passage , but I dont fear our Negroes standing as I se as yett, and hope to give your Worship content at my arrivall at Cabo Corso , which I hope will be before your Worships departure. [Wood was dispatched from Barbados back to Africa in April 1687 (no.975).] 919. Henry Wood ffrom on board the Coast Ffriggatt at Gambia , 29 July 1687 Understanding by Captain Mitchell that there being no Agent but govern ed by you, 93 I thought it fitt to give you accompt of my putting in to Gambia River. 94 Wee have twenty tun of rum in for the Royall Company , which hath filled our ship so foll that wee were forced to stave all our water butts , so lhat wee wanted water, for wee have been out of Barbados ever since the gthday of Aprill, and the next day after wee sprung a leak, so that wee were forced down to Mevis [=Nevis] to stop it. I have received from on board Captain Mitchell one barrell of powder , and one cask of tallow.

George Nanter Whiddah , 5 Jan . 1686/7 This comes by a canoe. Finding this opportunity I thought it fitt to give your Worship ao account of our proceedings at Whiddah. I hope I shall be ready to sail by the l Oof this instant , if it please God to send me fair weather to get the goods ashore and they stand aboard, but I shall not be able to purchase above two hundred and sixty slaves by reason women are scarce, for judge that I shall have 3 men to one woman, and severall barrels ofbooges pranes [= proves ?] so large that [ms 'qt'] I am forc't to give the countrey people above a hundred pound for a slave and many of them will take other goods in the room ofbooges , and in thirty caskes ofbooges I have had almost one i11 durt and termerick, 95 and for my twenty cases of spirrits I have profered them for three good men slaves and cannot sell them to the natives, and as for my sleti[a]s they doe not care for them, but as for all the rest ofmy goods they are very well, and my correll most part of it is very small soc that I give 14 ounces for a good man slave. One of my men dyed the 30th of December, his name was Isaac Clifford, he was sick at Cabo Corso, and two of my slaves bath got the small pox but I keepe them ashore, and as for all the rest are very well and as good as I ever saw in a shipp or ashore in my life. 96 I arrived here the 26th of Decembe r. The price of slaves I find to be little differing from our last voyage. [Nanter was dispatche d from Whydah, 10 Jan. 1687 (no.823).

I would have sent downe by the Ffrancis, butt that I hoped I should not bee a week or ten dayes after her, and believe I should not been more , bad not meet with small winds and being in with the shoare. I hope within two or three dayes to waite upon you with our shipp, and therefore desire your worsh ips excusee, for a thing ignorantly done, as not knowing your haste for the pacquett. [By 3 Dec. 1686, Buttram was at Sekondi (no.59).

I received your letter where you advise me of [my] being at Comenda, and now writeing to you, but your information is not true , for I have not been in the roade nor near it by five leagues since I departed Caho Corso Castle. I have since my departure from you been very sick for 4 or five days, [so] that at one time I thought to retume to you againe. Gentlemen, you thinke what you please of my being to windward, and neglecting the Companyes intrest , but I will assure you that I have fulfilled every hour of time, butt with little winds and leeward currants, can gett no ffurther. On the 4th instant at l Oat night, wee saw a ship to sea and made towards her. When wee came neare her wee fired severall gunns at her, she likewise at us . Wee chased her all night of att sea till the next morning breaking day and about six came up with him, whom wee found to be a Brendenburgh, who giveing us no mo re accompt then Captain Towers, only that the pyrate doth not intend to come downe, heareing wee are here, he expecting another of his consorts. When wee first gave chase to the shipp wee was off of Butterue , and in the morning when wee left him wee was abreast the Mina 7 leagues off, and that day with a fresh sea brees gott up to Taccarado , but now have such stronger leeward cun-ants, and little winds , that makes me feare that I shall not be able with soe heavy a sayler to gett up to Ashine in your days appointed per order. Gentlemen , according to your orders I will fuUfill to the utmost ofmy power, but soe many dayes being expended and wee no further, doe much doubt to fullfill your desire, unless the pyrate will be soe kind to come downe to us, wee being not able to gett up to him unless better winds and currants help us. Wee have now a very strong currant running to eastward. Wee indeavored last night in a small tumadoe, and likewise this morning, but lost ground, and do not know how long wee may be a gettin about the breakers, this place and Cape Tres Pointus being very troublesome [to] soe great a shipp as ours is unless favored as aforementioned. Gentlemen , I hope you have a favorable construction of [Thomas James]. [On 7 Nov. the Mary left Takoradi , bound for Axim (no.296), where on l 0 Nov. James fought with the pirate (no.I 14).

Thomas James From on board the Mary, Whydah, 29 Dec. 1687 These lines are to acquaint you ofmy safe arrivall att Whydah , which was on the 23d instant in company with Captain Burdis. Since my departure from you I have been ill, but through mercy at present am in good health. Wee have now on board in all 192 slaves, and doe hope shall have the rest in a short time. I am very sorry that I had not the honor to carry home the Companys gold. Since Captain Du Cas and I parted soe lovingly at Amersa , sending by me downe to their Factor 116 one hogshead of wine, twenty anchors of brandy, and two baggs of bread, which I have since delivered to the person left alive, which was Doctor before the Chiefe dyed. Gentlemen I am sorry your computation of my Arda cargoe will prove soe short by at least 30 Negroes , which will be a loss both to the owners 117 and my selfe. I doe wonder where this mistake can be, for at that allowance that Mr White gave me, wee shall want forty slaves, but I hope I shall purchase our complement into 30. I shall take all the care I can in the purcbaseing of of slaves. As for Mr Carter be has not above one hundred Negroes ready. Slaves indeed are pretty plenty, which makes me hope my stay here to be short. I have from Mr Carter all the assistance that he can doe for me, he designing to goe home with us. 118 Gentlemen I have no more to acquaint you off at present. [The Mary left Whydah 4 Feb. 1688 (no.827).] The Hannah, Commander Robert Cowley 950.

Wee camefrom Graves End the 2dAugust and arrived at Cape Mount the 17th October, and have been ever since a coming along the Coast. I have sent my mate downe withfourteen soldiers and one Factor.

As for thelong boate, I was not willing to send them by her by reason it was soe farr, and thatthe boate soe very deepe, and since I could not send them, but before I receivedyour last, which was but this morning, I had sent our ciff [= skiff] with the letters. [On 14 Dec. the Hannah was at Komenda, talcing in com (no.307); but hadbeen dispatched from there by 2 Jan. 1688 (no.584).] 953. Robert Cowley, Jr From on board the Hannah at Annam[aboe], 5 Jan. 1687/8 These few lines are to satisfie you of our driving downe in the sloope with the cunant, and at 12 a clock at night ankored abrest of the shipp Hannah, and at sun rising wee did gett the gold safe on board the shipp Hannah. My long boate is gone ashoare to fetch of fifteen chest of come, which is all I am to have, 121 and as soone as she doth retume I doe intend to sayle. [Later in January Cowley was at Accra (no.794).] 954. Robert Cowley, Jr Whiddah, 5 March 1688 I have made bouJd to write these few lines unto you concerning my bad fortune, for when I came downe here to Whiddah, which was on the 10th day of January, where l found the Mary, and she did not set sayle till the 3dday ofFebruary, 122 and now at this date I have but two hundred and twenty slaves, and do beleive that it will be three weeks, before I shall be ready to go from hence, 123 and then do believe I shall have spent one hundred and fifty chests of of come at least, which will be a great loss to me. l verily beleive the Company will quickly be a weary with this their contract with Captain Wyboume. 124 [The Hannah arrived in Barbados 11 June 1688, now commanded by Thomas Godfrey, Cowley having died en voyage. 125] The Elizabeth, Commander Edmond Batheme 955. Edmond Batheme Cape Appilonia, 29 Dec. 1687 After my most humble service to you all., I hav e sent my mate with my Jong boate with what passingers wee have fol" your place, and desiring you to send me a line or two bow goods sell, that I may the better know bow to governe my selfe in disposing of my cargoe both for the benifitt of the Company and owners of our shipp. Our trade to windward here is little or nothing, for the French bath setled a Factory at Asshinee, and hath put on shoare eighteen guns in order to build a ffortification. Yesterday wee came from Asfu.inee, and there wee left a French man of 36 peeces of ordinance, which lyes there to settle their Factory. 126 Yesterday when wee ankored at this place wee found heere a French shipp , which presently waied and went farther to leeward, 127 soe that I feare trade to windward of Cape Tres Pointus is spoiled for us, but I hope Gentlemen you will give me a better incouragement for the disposing of my perpetuanoes , by reason the grate quantity I have. Gentlemen , I would desire you to know whether you have come plenty to come me, or that l shall buy come to windward. [On 3 Jan. 1688 Batheme was repo1ted to be at Axim (no.121) ; and shortly afterwards he was apparently at Sekondi, where he supplied goods to the factory (no.123).] 956. Edmond Batheme Abbody, 16 Jan. 1687/8 I received yours bearing date the 1st ofthis instant, being very glad to beare of aJI your good healths. Gentlemen, I make bould to trouble you with a line or two of our affaire of trade, which I hope Gentlemen you will commiserate me, and give me your best advice both for the intrest of the Company and owners of our shipp for since our first coming on this Coast the French hath been a greate instigation to the hinderance of our trade, by reason their riding in all places where I have been, canoes would not come aboard fearing them. The 13th instant I came to Comenda but found noe trade , by reason of the pallavers there. 128 Gentlemen , I hope since it falls soe unhappily that wee are frustrated in our windward trade by reason of the French and Dutch interlopers, you will be pleased to give me an order that I may come soe near your Castle as you tbinke conveinent, for here I lye and day Jy Dutch interlopers pases me, and that mony which properly belongs to me, those rogues they run away with. [The next day, 17 Jan., Batheme was reported to be still anchored between Shama and Sekondi, but endeavouring to get further west (no.124). He reached Sekoodi 19 Jan., and left there 31 Jan. (nos 126, 129). In early February he was at Komenda , taking in corn (nos 318-20), and on 15-16 Feb. at Anomabu, also for com (nos 591-2).) 957. Edmond Batbeme Whiddah , 5 March 1688 Having this oppertunity, by a canoe bound for your place, is to give you an accompt of our arrivall at this place of Whiddah, where I still meet with the same misfortune as I have don from the first of my trade to windward. Captain Cowley is here, and hope in seaven days may be dispatcht from hence with his slaves, 129 but the French gives greater prizes for their slaves, more than wee can do. 130 The Dragon, Commander Francis Buttram (second voyage) 958. Francis Buttram Dickiscove , 3 Feb. 1687/ 8 I arrived here last night, and find the trade being very backward, having as yett most part of my goods unsould. I thought convenient to advise you, being obliged to goe noe lower downe then Taccarada without your orders, therefore shall desire you may be pleased to dispatch the bearer adviseing your opinion , and if any encouragement you can give me to fall downe, if not I have thoughts to goe to windward againe tho I have endeavored to draine them, 131 but I doe not doubt but that they are now recruted, notwithstanding there are severall other vessells. lf any incouragement to fall downe, be pleased to advise tbe prizes of what goods are most in demand, that I may the better goveme my selfe here if any trade offers. I have been timerous to send the letters by the canoe, fearing any diasastor. I have severall goods and provitions for the Castle, and should be very glad if I goe to windward you would order some secure way for your letters, for I am fearfull to disable my shipp by sending my boate, not knowing what may offer. I am to receive 320 Negroes at Whidah and 40 more on the Gold Coast. 132 959. Francis Buttram From on board the Dragon at Taccarada, 9 Feb. 1687/ 8 I am sorry I should make such a mistake in not sending the Companys packett downe in the former canoes. Wee arrived in the roade ofTackarada about 4 of the clock this day, and a little before received yours, and have made all the dispatch I could to send our boate downe with the packett in her. As for Doctor Abbitt I desire your excuse, I having our Doctor and severalJ other people sick and lame, but question not by Gods blessing and his indeavors they may all doe well againe. I desire if yames be at the rate as they were the last voyage that you would order 4000 yames to be gott for me, and I will be willing to takesoe much the lesse come as they may value. [2 or 3 days later, Buttram anchored at Aboadi , between Sekoncliand Shama (no.130). In March, when he was at Anomabu taking in corn, he was warned from Sekondi of the approach of a suspected French pirate (no.371); but meanwhile, WiIJiam Ronan had already been sent fom Cape Coast Castle to help him meet this threat, as follows.) 960. William Ronan Annamaboe, 15 March 1687/8 To prevent the danger we apprehend I have brought the gold asboare this morning. Wee could take notice comeing downe last night that the French boarded the Portuguez, and we doe likwise imagine that he has plundered him and commanded him to anchor to the windward of our sbipp. He has himself between both vessels anchored, and as soon as the sea brease comes we belive and expect that he will be upon Captain Buttram, if soe Captain Buttram designes to let all slip, and runn under Connantyo Fort. Wee have sent an express to the Factor there to give him what protection be can. Captain Buttram desires you may be pleased to send him downe imediatly 20 or 30 men well armed. I hope they may be downe before the land brees be done. Captain Buttram has made all the preporations imaginable to receive him. Here is noe canoes to shipp your come, soe that our cano and what you send down may doe it, if things fall contrary to expectation. 961. Francis Buttram From on board the Dragon, 16 March 1687/8 I can heare litle more than wee did yesterday . Here bath severall canoes been aboard to buy goods, but be tells them he comes to buy slaves, and the onely goods they can see aboard him is course perpetuanoes , and iron barrs , and would byre canoemeo to go along with him. He lyes nearer the Portuguez than wee, which I thought he had surprized, but the Blacks tell me that the Portuguez hath made a great complaint for water, so that he hath spared him severall casks, and doth say he will come on board us, and goe also ashoare at this place . For my part I desire none of his company, for I still beleive bim to be a rouge. Wee are as well provided as I can, and hope shall doe indifferently well with him. I have put no come on board this day, by reason of him, but doe intend tomorrow to venture if he rides fast, or if you please to spare me some men for the time he lyes here. I understand Mr Nightingale has no canoes fitt to bring the come into the boate, therefore I desire the favor of haveing the canoe that brought us downe. The gold is ashoare and hope it will be safe. 962. William Ronan on board the Dragon, 17 March 1687 /8 Wee are still in the same thoughts as formerly. The rogue has attempted nothing as yet. He doth not admitt any canoes to go aboard the Portuguez. He keeps some of his men aboard his owne shipp, pretending to show them how to dispose of his goods. By Monday night wee expect to have all the come aboard, and if this rogue does not go away, the Captain will go up with the shipp to Cabo Corso. Captain Buttram is of opinion it may be convenient to send notice by a two hand canoe to Captain Batheme, for this is undoubtedly a rogue. Captain Buttram salutes you. [Buttram left Anomabu on 25 March (nos 603-4) , and shortly afterwards called at Accra (no.805). He was at Whydah to take in slaves by early April, but was not dispatched from there until Sept. 1688. 133] The Expedition , Commander Abednego Stuart 963. Abednego Sturt From on board the shipp Expedition, 20 Feb. 1687/8 I have sent you what letters I have for you, and passingers, by my mate in the long boate. I arrived on the Coast the 20th day of January, but meeting with litle wind, and windward currants, I have been a long time a coming downe. My contract is to lye 40 days after my arrivall, to lye to windward of Cape Tres Pointus, where by contract with the Company I am allowed to buy 20 Gold Coast slaves, for guardians, 134 and 230 chests of come, which my owners are concerned in, as well as the Company by contract, which if I cannot buy you are to provide me withall. Therefore I desire you would send me a line or two by my mate, that 1 may know the better what to do, because I am bound to Virginia, which is a long run, therefore I hope you will let me have your advise, and dispatch me after I come downe in a little time. [On 27 March, Sturt was at Anomabu, taking in com, and was depatched from there the following day (no.603-4 , 702).] 964. Abednego Sturt Anamaboe, 28 March 1688 My humble service to you all, and heartily thanke you for sending downe the canoe and men. l have received all my come, and now I will say le. I would desire you , if you thinke fitt, to send home the money per Captain Bridges , and what letters I sent per the canoemen. [Sturt went on to Whydah , which he reached by early April 1688.] 135 The Dolphin , Commander Robert Barrett [Barrett left England in Oct. 1686, with instructions to trade for gold and ivory , and slaves for delivery to Nevis. 136 ] 965.

You are informed of Captain Buttram (I suppose) wh y it came not sooner to your hands .137 I fell in with Cape Mount the 26th of the last, and am oblidged per charter party to spend 40 days on this side the Cape . Crave mean time your directions and comands.

Have fow1d a mistake in the accompts, and shall therefore wait on you to morrow in the morning , as soon as possibly I may . [Barrett left Egya on 4 April 1688 (no.373) ; later in the same month he was at Accra , where he delivered goods (no.808); and went on to Whydah .138] The Sherbro, Commander John Lomax [Lomax arrived at Dixcove , and sent his boat to Sekondi , 12 March 1688 (no.132) .] 967. John Lomax From on board the Sherbrow, Dickiscove, 14 March 1687/8 I sent the RoyaJI Company letters to Succondee. I now send three of the Companyes servants, with letters to Captain Petley Wyboume, which if you can, pray forward to his hand, and if my mate deliver you any gold pray give him a receipt for what you receive. Trading is very dull and bad. I have fifty odd hundred of mallegetta, I fear it will heat in the caske and spoyle and I cannot help it, for some of it was wett when I received it. It is in my sbipp caske, and hope you will find either casks or baggs to put it in, when it shall please God that I arrive. I understand that one of the Company Factors was very angry that I sent not the letters away sooner. I shall give what respects to the Royall Company's Factors as becomes me, and I hope the Company's new methods they have taken in chousing a committy is much better than to be lorded over soe much as has been by one person, who some of late days has thought themselves as great as Kings . 139 I am and hope I shall shew my self your obliging servant. Pray hasten away and if you please to give an answer you will oblige [JL]. 968. John Lomax Dickiscove , 15 March 1687 /8 Yours of the 13th have received with the advice, which thanke you for. By this time my long boat is with you, who will advise you that there [is] noe likelybood of slaves, neither is there any trade. I herewith send Mr Wybourne s letters, which were left behind [in] our boate, and two for Mr Wight. Pray give my service to Captain Buttram, and tell him what letters were in our shipp he will receive by the boate. Pray forward Mr Wyboumes letters per Captain Buttram, with my love and service to him and all you Gentellmen. l hope I shall have an opertunity to write to my owners per Captain Buttram. [Lomax came in his boat from Dixcove to Sekondi, but returned to his ship, 21 March 1688 (no.

The two last days I gott but four one day and two the other, soe if they would give me them for nothing, it not be worth my while to spend my time at that rate, nor have I any other trade, they put me off from day to day. I gott Ayre the chiefnegroe at Succondee to goe to them, which put me to some small charge, who told them how well you would take it and resent it if they furnished me with come and give me a quick dispatch, but all to noe purpose, and give them what goods they please amd almost att what rates tbey please. Wee have lately mett with two very bad tumadoes, lost my boates and cut my cables. My boates I gott againe with some charge , I lost one ancor. I wish I bad not come this voyage, I have no chapemen, Black merchants nor Factors that comes to cheapen my goods, I cannot sell them at any rates. I intend to lye here this weeke, that is about seaven days, and Ifl can have noe encouragement in that time li e come downe to Caho Corsoe and deliver my remaynes according to the Companys orders. In the meantime I have sent you my boate with some wooden ware. Discharge her and send her mee back with a line or two if you Please how to govern my self, which will be very exceptable. Suffer my boat not to stay ashoare but send her back with what speed you can, and if you you want them Ile send you more of those goods.
