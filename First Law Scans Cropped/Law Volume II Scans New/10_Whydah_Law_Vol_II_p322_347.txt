IX WHYDAH The RAC factory in Rueda ('Whydah', 'Whiddah', 'Whidah') bad been estab.lished in 1682, superseding an earlier factory at Offra, in the kingdom of Allada ('Ardr a' etc.) to the east. 1 In 1682-3. the RA C's factory had been in Savi, the royal capital of the Hueda kingdom, about 6 miles inland;2 but by 1685, as is clear from the first letter in this correspondence , it had been moved to the village of Glehue (modern Ouidah), situated to the north of the lagoon which runs parallel to the coast.3 An English interloper called Pettey Wybourne had also established a factory at Glehue in Whydah , and he was still there, trading in competition with the Company at the beginning of this correspondence ( cf. no.812) , but early in 1686 he was forcibly removed by the RAC's agents, and deported back to England. 4 However , in 1687 Wybourne came to an agreement with the RAC to serve as their own agent in Whydah, and he arrived there, as reported in this correspondence, at the beginning of 1688. The Whydah factory was principally important for slaves, but there is also some reference in this correspondence to the possibility of trading for locally made cloth, which Europeans purchased for re.sale on the Gold Coast (nos 812, 821-2). The French Guinea Company also maintained a factory at Whydah through.out this period, while the Dutch West Indian Company had one at neighbouring Offra to the east, both of which are occasionally mentioned in this correspon.dence. Correspondence between the Whydah factory and Cape Coast Castle was evidently more irregular than with the other factories on the Gold Coast. The reason for this is evident from this correspondence , in which the Whydah factor complains repeatedly of his difficulties in getting African canoes to carry messages to the Gold Coast, while the small RAC vessels based at Cape Coast did not nonnally return directly up the coast, but went east to Cape Lopez in Gabon and then west through the open sea to reach the coast west of the Gold Coast, so that any letters sent by such ships would be long in transit. 5 In addition to details of trade locally the Whydah correspondence also throws some light on RAC and other European trading along the coast to the west, at Keta ( 'Kitto'), Little Popo and Great Popo; in particular a unique and invaluable detailed account of a visit by the RAC factor at Whydah to Little Popo in 1687 (no.825). 812. John Carter Whiddah, 19 Sept. [1685] 6 This accompanys Captain Henry Wood in the George Sloop, who I perceive was not ordered here, but by necessity of the badness of his rudder come to an anchor to have some iron work made for the safe gaurd thereof, but be that was ordered to call here, which was Mr Obery, 7 was so well fitted to serve the Company that either he had nothing or could or would not spare us any thing, soe that if the Company ffactoryes be in never soe much distress, they are not to supply or assist us, by reason of breach of orders. If they had belong to any other nation or place eke I might I beleive a gott something out of them. It bath been a custome in former times and I think alwaies till now, and am sure tis alwaies expedient that when a vessel I of the Companys is orderd for the Madearahs for wine, to France for brandy, or to Barbadoes for rum, that soon affter the arrivall of such liquors all the ffacloryes use'd to be supplyd with a stock according to their expence, some a butt some more, at the Companys price. Now that I beleive and am inform'd that your Honour is alwayes in action and therfore your head taken up with many other of the Companys concern es and troublesome bussiness; but I am almost certaine that their is some other heads about you that should be ease to you, are more taken up with pot, boul [= bowl] or glass concemes than anything of the Companys business, and if they can but swill their gutts , will care for none eke, therefore tis my advice when next His Excellency as they call it knights them againe it may be Sir Tymothy Dolittle, Sir Roger Doe Nothing , Sir Andrew Love Nobody, and soe forth and with this addition, (but drink). Had they been Orambarrowes [sic: = ?], l would have excused it. Here for our necessary expense have been forced to give two slaves an ancor for brandy , and canot have enough [even] so, and I think tis reason that these before mentioned knights should pay for this extravagant charge , it being not the Company fault but theirs, for not mentioning such a expedient to your Honour. 0 fine brave councellors, you know that the ffactory was burnt and great part of the Companys goods , 8 and noe ship hath been here since that had a sufficient cargo to leave any remaynes; and that I am at great charge in building, 9 and twi ll be affine creditt for the Company, that l must be fforc'd to borrow goods to supply our wants of the Ffrench ffactory or worse of Captain Wybwáne, which I must doe ifl canot perswade Mr Obery or Mr Wood to put some oftbeircargo ashore, which I am affraid they will not, it being a breach of orders, because I am not a Boneen or Bit 10 Negroe &ca., JI though without orders I adventure to supp ly the Company ships with any neces saryes or assistance that I can. I remember before I came out of England and since it was the generall discow-se of Comanders that they cou ld not be supply' d with any thing from the Companys factors, but from Captain Wyburue, which was true enough, but now it is quite contrary, I want no supp ly for ships but have allready, but I want some from them. Captain Wilcox and Captain MinghamI 2 dyed here , the ffirst the 28th of March, the other the zd August 1685. Captain Lowder and Captain Rickard had great sickness here, particularly Captain Lowder and lay a long time here from the 22 April to the 26 July, Negroes then being very scarse, by reason of some pallaver up in the cuntrey, 13 but now are very plentifull againe, for the ffirst day I went up to the kings town 14 to mark Negroes for Captain Mingham I mark'd 59 slaves, 51 men and 8 wome n, but Captain Lowder and Captain Rickards went both we ll away, but shorte of their comple.ment of Negroes considerab ly by reason of short cargoes_ Is By reason of the death of John Mingham here is bad news that the doctor 16 with GabrilJ Cloise, Captain Woods mate, is run away with the ship and 170 Negroes of the Company without signing bills of load ing. 17 The doctor, who commands , saith they designe to be honest , and deliver the Companys Negroes at tbe Companys ffactors at Jamaico, but whethe r they will or not I canot say, but I fear they are and will be rouge s, if U1ey can conveniently. Affter the death of the commander Tadvised them to goe up to Cabo Corso as you may se by this inclosed paper , whicb I sent to them by Mr Wortley , 18 who read it aboard and [they] seemed to be all well sattisfied. In order thereunto [I] put Negroes on board and was making all the dispatch J could my selfe, when Mr Obrey came down and ashore , for 2 or 3 days could not gett a canoe of, in which time they had seduced Charles Langli 9 and got him aboard and con:find him, and then with resolution the ships company declared they would keep him and proceed on their voyage to the West India according to charter party , but affter some time Charles Langly got away from them on board the Jacob Pink againe , where he continues . Then the doctor declared himselfe able, and said be could carry the ship himselfe to Jamaica , and desired bis bills of loading to sign, which I writ and sent aboard, but before he had signed them Captain Wood came to an anchor and came ashore to gett his iron work done for his rudder, and the same afftemone being the 15th September his mat e Gabriell Cloyse went aboard and 10 the clock that night they weighed and went away without signing. Captain Wood ordered if they offered to sayle to ffire at them, and accordingly that they did 2 guns with shott , and Doctor Thomas Byre , who bares the command of the Jonas , fired l gun with shott at them againe and went away. The winner hath liberty to laugh, the loosser to speak, the agrcived to complayn, therefore I hope you will not be angrey at my just complaint, since I am much agreived . [PS] The Company surely thinks I have a great stock by me, or eke they would not mention in their charter partyes as if their ffactors here might hav e 3 or 400 Negroes ready to put on board every ship, it being worded after this manner, that if our factors at Ardra 20 shall have your complement of negroes reddy to put on board , then you shall deliver him your cargoe ashore , and it can not be possible , that I can purchase soe many slaves , without goods 21 and you will perceive by the inclosed account that I had not much left last June , and unless your Honour contrive some conveniency I canot possible gett a letter carried up more than once a year .22 Therefore 1 ought to have a sufficient supply of all things , by[ = but] all ships that comes here are so pillaged at Cabo Corso that they bring nothing with them . Captain Low der complayned of the coast [= cost] for se lling his brandy at la per gallon, but here would not spare any for 2a per gallon nor 4a per [gallon] , and Captain Rickard would have bought brandy here if it were to be sold. I am very angrey with the severall swill gutts that your Honour hath about you that have dnmk up all the ships stock and stores. For above twelve months time, noe ship hath brought brandy, sugar, wine and all complayn it went away at Cabo Corso. If you please to send Captain Wood down here with sutiable goods, whose ship will be able to carry up slaves and cloth23 and turne up along shore in 3 weeks time in all probabi lity, especially between this and the month March, being the best time of the year, 24 and I beleive her voyage may turne to as good account as where she can be sent. I had not given any consent to come to Ardra but the Company promised me a packet vessell to be constantly sent between Cabo Corso and this place, and although she be not fitt for it by reason of the defects of Captain Benda lls judgement ,25 that is noe sure arguement that I shall have none, but ley here to starve or be fforced to shift for myselfe. Ifl could have a vessell down here, and goods and advice beforehand, I could have slaves and cloths ready to put on board without staying her longer than takeing them in. 813. John Carter Whiddah, 28 Dec. [1685]26 I have received many letters from you, all tending to the same purpose, of assista nce to be given to every person, which I assuredly doe, by reason tis my duty to assist all persons in the Companyes servis. I wish others would doe the like, then 1 might have bad some assistance from Cabo Corso Castle many times before this. Your judgements must be very weak, if you cannot disseme that every ships Ardra cargoe is to short to purchase his slaves and therefore can leave noe remaynes, or elce you must imagine I am like the came lion to live by the air.27 How can you imagine that since the ffire and charges of building, and the length oftime, but I must want a supply, that you write in all your late letters, that I should send word if I wan t any thing, when Mr Winder knows (if his greatness hath not lifted him above his reason)28 that we cannot send up by canoes but once a year, and for that reason I did not come out of England with my ffingers in my mouth, but the smack sent with me for an advice boate, to doe nothing but pass from Cabo Corso to Whiddah and from Wbiddah to Cabo Corso, but with thanks to the Gentelmen at Cabo Corso, niether she nor any other small vessell, notwithstanding there was enough at Cabo Corso tl1at somtimes were not better imploy'd, and might have been spared to have been sent directly down here yet now it is almost two years since the smack came down last. Indeed some of your small vessells have ca!Jed here as they were goeing to the Boneen, or other places to leward, but with such convenent orders that ifwe were burning, starving, dying noe assistance to be had of them, unless I would have gone to the Boneen and be a Boneen negroe, which I offered to be here, and have paid them as well. Tis a wonder to me that this ffact01y being of so principal! concemment to the Company, shiping of twice as many negroes as all the Coast besides, 29 and that a small vessell hath not been sent down to see in what condition. Tis well !mown that the Company ordered one for that purpose. I am much beholding to you as well as the Company for consignment however . I will not be wanting on my part to serve my masters. The less freindship I find, the less I am in debt. 814. John Carter Whidab, 1 March 1686 Yours by the 4 hand canoe were all received and they were speedy in their passage, but they would not returne in [so] small a canoe but stay' d for mine and Quashee, that Captain Low hired at Annamaboe, 30 which now goes in company together. I likewise received all yours, I suppose, by severall ships; but could not answer them reddily by reason the ships did not return to Cabo Corso, for their has been 110 opertunity that I could here of or procure butt I have writ up since the l 0th of March last twelve months past, though I have endeavour'd and profferd good encourage.ment, yet could I not perswade any canoemen to goe up, baveing been well supply'd and furnish'd with necessaryes, [and a] canoe for that purpose, and within two months I hired 30 canoemen , that our own ships brought down, to goe up, and on a suddain for noe reason that I know the most of them ran away, and disperced them selves amongst the Mine canoes. 31 Therefore unless you can here [= hire] and oblige a gang of canoe men to come down and reh1rne imediately, it is allmost impossible to perswade them to goe up at any other time than about the hennitan time, 32 and this I beleive is not unknown to Mr Winder. Notwithstanding you seem to admire in severall of your letters that you here not from me, but indeed (I] have the gratist cause of admiration , first that the Company at my request and desire should buy a small vessell and send her out on purpose and purely for an advice boat from Cabo Corso to this place and to pass and repass , as occasion required and time would pennitt, for the better settlement and government of this factory , but since the time I came here niether shee nor any other vessell have sent, though I have been inforrn'd by severall, that somtimes one vessell was designed to be sent down and other times another , [so] that I did still live in hopes. Now there is three reasons for such a vessell to be sent, first because the Company did order it; secondly because the destruction by fire did request it; thirdly because you did not here from us in soe long time. Twas requested a vessell should have been sent to se in what condition we were in, I mean the factory was in, which might very well be thought to be bad enough after such distraction [sic] by fire and no house to put our heads in but ai1 ioterloper. 33 Before I came out of Eng land I told the Company we could send advice home with more certainty at some times of the year than to Cabo Corso, therefore desired the said vessell and they granted it. The last letter that Mr Winder wrot to Cabo Corso to Agent Greenhill I saw when l was there, 34 wherein he advised the Agent that 500 iron bars was proper to be sent down in a cargo , and since that time very few ships have brought out any and then but few in a cargo, which must of necessity make them a commodity. Notwithstanding all this Mr Winder hath advised those ships that had any to dispose of them before they came here. The last he so advised was Mr Elwes ,35 who by reason of that advice sold all his bars to windward , and did not bring one here, as if purposely he[= Winder] designed to doe us all the ingury he can, which 1admire att. l doe admire that the Affrican Merchant, the Company[ s] one [= own] ship comeing to tbe Company[s] own factory , should be stint'd to a short cargo and with a great quantity of large bouges , soe much behinde merchantable, that it was IO slave loss to her cargo in slaves ,36 and J admire the said ships cargo was not 37 Iconsign'd to me, the reason for it would be as wellcome to meas a markofgold. am shure you must allow my expences here to be greater than any mans on the Coast , and (excepting the Agent) my sallery and security greater than any persons than on the Coast, as [IJ imagaine , but for these and other favours from you Gentlemen at Cabo Corso I thank you for, as sending down liquors for factoryes expences , and a convenient supply of goods and the great conveniency of the advice boate. The last letter l sent you by the canoe was the 10th of Ma rch last, and that and the former gave you an account that I wanted goods, and you have sent me none since but a little in Captain Lowder. I have no goods of the Companyes, but am forc'd to make use of the estate of deceas'd persons and my own to maintain the factory, therefore canot make up my account till I am supplyd . I hope shall not be distress'd like Deans to pawn the factory,38 therefore I request you will be please to order down by a speedy conveyance, and [sic] a large stock of goods, that I may be furnished to purchase a quantity of Negroes reddy against any ships arrivall; and the good I desire are, vizt I 000 iron barrs; 20 barrells bougees; 100 long cloths; l 00 white bafts; 100 allejars; I 00 pintadoes, white ground; 600 pautkeis; 6 pieces of scarlett cloth; 2 pieces redd cloth; 40 red perpetuanoes; cmnll [= coral], if any; good rangoes, if any; lemmons past, white and purple, as big as pease; large christall; christoll stripd white; sletias, if any. If the George sloope be arrived at Cabo Corso, as I hope she may, 1 request your Honour will please to order her down, with what goods you please to send downe, and if you can furnish her with 6 or 8 oars for rowing, 1 will [put] 20 or 30 stout slaves one [= on] board, who will quickly be entstrnckt'd to row, which may be a great help to her comeing up. If soe accomplished I would not in the least doubt of getting up in her in 14 or 20 days time, and and I long to se Cabo Corso, therefore hope there will be none soe unkind as to putt a stop, or delay any means, that may tend to soe reasonable happiness. Gentlemen I came out of England in good equipage as to security sallery and great promises from the Company, with a small vessell, called a smack, which was brought and sent out purposely for my use, as Cheife of this factory, well knowing the necessity of such an expedient at this place, now depriv'd of the conveniency of the own[= one] and my expectation being wholly frustrated in the performance of the other, pray doe not mock at my misfortunes , because I am not soe happy as to be at Cabo Corso, where some have had the advantage of rising to greater preferment than they came out for. You will doe me a great favour if you will give me your sentement what you think the Company designd when they sent out a vessell and call 'd her the advice boat or packett vessell for Whiddah. Captain Bridges is now arrivd the 4¡' March , and in your letter by him you tell me of severall Mine canoes come up, which I beleive to be true, but they doe nott goe of from hence but from Pickaninee Popo , 39 [so] that I am not acquainted with their departure, but ifl were, I should not have write by them by reason I have at the same time been sending up my own canoe, which now is above 3 months past and so long delayd by reason of the roguishness of the canoemen, that I had spoake to and hired, a list of their names and places here send inclosed. I have at all times of the year indeavour'd to gett canoe men and profer'd them any cano they would take, and 7 and 8 cloths a man to goe up, but could not prevaile till now [with] those canoemen that comes up, and all the reason I can gather is that the Comanders are put to hire canoemen themselves, and by that means the canomen think themse lves noe waies relayted to the Company; but when the Commanders discharges them think themselves abused by me, I suppose, because they have not the canoe given them, though at the same ti.me I offer them a canoe if they will goe, but they will be sole masters thereof, for the canomen generall[y] importune the Comander to give them thee canoe when the ship is slaved, which the Commanders for the most part grant upon their good behaviour, which is but seldom. 40 Now by reasons they gett not the canoe J suppose they impute it to my fault, of all which I pray informe your selfe of Mr Wortley and Unguah, who comes up by this canoe. It may be you may think 1 am passionate, but I am sattisfied 1 have just reason to complaine, but to conclude I hope you will by first conveyance be pleas' d to answer my request as far as the Castle affords , and if the George sloop doe not arrive time enough, then by some other convenient vessell, that she may returne up with account of what state we are in. I am in great want of white men, haveing only my selfe, Mr Wo1i ley and Mr Smith, and here should be 6 at least. If you please to send any down lett them be good men that will not dey [= die] with laziness. I here Samuell Chambers was comeing, I think he may doe well for own[ = one]; since the writeing I have an ill ca1Tccter of Samuell Chambers. What I cant think ofto write Mr Wortley will give your Honour to understand. What goods wilJ be sent down, if any is not packt up I desire they may be put up in sheet chests, and will pay the warehouse keeper for them if they are at the accustomed price, which was halfe an angle per chest, then if their be 40 or 50 chests I shall gladly pay for them. Captain Woodfine41 is above halfe slaved and doubt not but he will be compleated in less than ten dayes more. The Orange Tree is arriv' d and I hope will be dispatcht in a month or 5 weeks time at farthest, but he also hath a shorte cargo. I should be glad to se Mr Winders computement of the cargo of these two ships that are the Company[s] own, for I can not understand how he makes it outt. I want to se Caho Corso my selfe to discourse fully of mine own business, which I hope shall accomplish some small time . In the intrim refer you to Mr Wortley and to your own serious consideration of what I have write. PS . Since now you may perceive I cannot send up but once a year , if you have not the conveniency of sending down a small vessell please to order down canomen with positive comands to return , that you may have a better account ofaffaires here . Captain Thomas Browse and Captain Henry Ounsteed dyed here. 815. John Ca1ter Whidday, 3 May 1686 Herewith send you bills of loading from the severall ships departed from hence since you received any. Likewise the unwell come news of the death of my honours namesake late Commander of the Mary ,42 who dyed the 12th ApriU affter about 7 dayes sickness on board, and was brought ashore and buryed the 16th,and the l 7th at night the Mary and the Orange Tree sayld . Here goes up now three great canoes, all the Companyes except the canoe that Captain Carter brought down, which he gave to his canoemen. The graplin and graplin roap are all mine, which Jrequ[ e ]st may be sent down again, and begg your Honours will be pleased to order the smith to put three flukes more to one of them which hath but 2 now. By a Dutch ship that passed by here, I here that Captain Thomas Woodfine and Captain Buttler is an-iv'd at Cabo Corso. I hope they will not come down both together. TheFfrench hath brought a great quantity of iron barrs , therefore advise the ship not to bring to many , but if the quantity before mentioned for the factory I shall have the longer time to put them of, and they will not damnifie. I beleive here is 7 years store of musquetts therefore if these ships have any or powder to change it or sell it to windward. l hear Mr Winder is gon home, I doubt not but things will be better regulated now as to this place. I think he bath done much hurte for this place by his advise . 816. John Carter WhiddaJ1, 8 May 1686 Since my laste to you by tbe 3 canoe that went away I have seen the disposal) of all the [iron] bars the French had, which in the last ship were but 800 and in the other 1600, and all are gon and find [they] still are good therefore to contradict my last advise think it convenient that Captain Woodfine or the ship that sbalJ come down here bring a reasonable quantity of iron barrs with them, besides what you please to order me, but no guns nor powder for a great while. Slaves are plentiful , therefore advise tbe ships to hasten down. J question not if Captain Woodfine were here he would be slaved in LOor 12daye time if weather wou ld permit to bring bis goods ashore , wbich is aU, being in hast , the cano men staying . 817. John Carter Wbiddah, 7 June 1686 Jt is now three weeks past since a Dut(c)h ship came by here and told us that Captain Thomas Woodfine was at Annamaboe to take in come, and that in 3 or 4 dayes would be down, since which we have expected him eve,y day, and indeed will be very well come, for here is a great many slaves in the cuntrey reddy for him, that could his good[s] be gotta shore he might have his slaves in 10 days at ffarthest. Since my last to you, I have had a violent fitt of sickness, but thank God I am pretty well recoverd. I wonder I here no news from Mr Wortley, whether he be liveing or dead, or whether he arrivd at Cabo Corso or not, tis now three months past since he went. 43 Since the departure of our last ship[s] tbe Ma1y and Orange Tree, here hath fallen abundance ofraine [so] that the river44 bath risen 4 or 5 foot heither [ = higher] than ever I saw them and float' d [= flooded] the dry ground about a mile in breadth, and as yet are not quite down, but we can use canoes to carry goods over the river, if Captain Wood[fine] comes that shall be noe great hindrance to his dispatch. Iron barrs proves better than I thought they would, considering the quantity hath been brought [by) the French 2 ships, 2400, and Captain W oodfine 45 and Captain Bridges, 870, and yet they goe currant at 15 for a slave. If Captain Woodfine 46 should happy to come down without any, he shall not want my assistance if 1have any sent down, which I suppose I shall. This comes per the Mine cano that came down with Mounsieur Lefrea. 47 I have given them some brandy to be carefu ll of the delivery of this letter. 1 hope yo u injoy your health better there than I doe here. 818. John Carter Whiddah, 11 Nov. l 686 Just now tbe Dutch sloope comes up into the road bound up to the Mina. l supose I have just tyme to satisfie you that if the Affrican Pink,48 Captain Nanter, comes downe here without bouges itt will bee trou blesome to procure her slaves, butt it shall bee done to the best ofmy endeavour. 49 lfyou please to send her, the goods most proper withoutt bouges are as followeth : rangoes, good red, as many as you canne; currell, aboutt 400 lb; brasse neptunes, large; long cloth; sallempores; large white baftes, a great many, 100 slaves; broad white ground pintadoes, 200 peeces; pottkeys , 800 or 900 peeces ; paper sletias a few; striped Hollands, if any; yellow and white beads, if larger then a pea, the bigger the better. If these goods bee wanting, or if nott, twill be convenient to putt some good goods that will sell well for gold, and the gold will bee as good as bouges and purchase slaves att a more reasonable rate, and all men too, both with the whites and blacks, and this Ile make good halfe her quantite of slaves and more in good men, may bee had al 6 pease per head .soThe canoe now will follow very speedelye, which I could nott perswade to goe before. Bad newes flyes a pace , therefore suppose you have heard of Captain Thomas Woodfines death beefore the ship departed hence. Captaine Branfeild sailed 14 dayes past this day is gone Captain Poston and Captain Daile all well. All my peop le dead butt Mr Wort ley and my seJfe_51 In hast. 819 . John Carter Whiddah, 22 Nov. 1686 I wrote you very lately by the Dutch sloope, which was out of sight ofland before my cano could gett on board him, [so] that 1had noe time to coppie the letter, but think the substance was the same I shall now confirme , being in answer to your last concerning the accommodating the Affrican Pinck with men slaves without bougees , which may be easily be accomplished in the same manner I before mentioned . Affter the major part of his Arda cargo is proposed in suitable goods, haveing not bougcs, put a convenient quant ity of sallab\e goods that will purchase gold as she is coming and comeing down, and the produce of those goods will accomplish good men slaves, haveing already discoursed the point here with the king and the whiteman, and the gold will be brought ashore with much less charge and loss then bouges by 4 or 5 slaves in the quantity ofbooges such a ship requires . lftbe Pinck should not come down this advise will be good for any other ship that comes from England, if they come with short quantityes of bouges as now they doe, they cannot doe amis in disposeing of any goods unless tJ1esemost proper goods I now shall mention: rangoes long cloths, bafts, currall, pintadoes broad, pautkeis. Any other goods they may venture to dispose of for gold, and the gold will doe bettertben the goods [omission?] quantity of goods and produce in gold. I have here in closed sent up my last years account , I cou ld not make it up at the halfe years end as accustomary by reason 1had not goods to baUance before that came in Captain Woodfine, and now you may see what was remayuing some months past and at Christmas. Un less a supply comes down I shall bee ashamed to make up the halfe years account. Since this account have put IO slaves aboard Walker 15 slaves aboard Brand.fill and several! other small parcelis, besides factorys expence and building. There.fore I intreat your Honour and the Gen[t] lemeo of the Councill will consider and send down a sufficient supply, for every ship comes short cargoed, and rake [?= take) what they can from me. I have some times 12, 14 or 20 white men a shore, all maLntained at the factory and out of my store. Pray amoungst goods for me send more scarlett and red perpetuanoes , but they are not proper in a ships cargo by reason the king is urueasendable [= unreasonalble) in the demands of such goods, and tis not the king nor Cabusbeers that buy them. I have been so extreamly abussed by the Company that I am almost ashamed to think how I have written to you but much more to them, 52 though I have just grounds to complayn by reason my reputation is abused and myself slighted and every thing quite contrary to what was promised me in England. I gave 1000£ security, and am allowed also double sallery, and that I shall not be trusted with balfe soe much value as my security amounts to is verry hard, besides halfe a thousand inconveniences and tenn times the hazard ofmy life as any where on the Coast. Wittnese loss of a great many goods, Comma nders and all our people, and although it bath pleased Almighty God to spare my life yett I have very often a privatt whisper in my ears that I am threatened to be destroyd, one time by poyson and anothe r time otheiwise, which makes me look about me and call all my wilts together and almighty God to protect me. One time I travell with a g[u)ard and wel I armed and another time with an antidote in my pockett, and alwaies discourse the point to the king and Cabushers, but they deny any such intention and seem to be verry true and loveing , God knows their hearts . I doubt not but by the providentiall hand of God to whether all. I thank God am pretty well in health at present, and now to oblige the king and Capusheers am building a small house at the kings town. 53 I shall[ = send) here inclosed a list of the dead and living. A proper Arda cargo is bougees; currall; rangoes; long cloths and sallempores; bafts; white pintados; allejars; pautkeis ; brass neptunes ; iron barrs; paper sletias, if good; any fine white luinen; beads, purple , white, lemon culler, green, all round and as bigg almost as a horse beane. [PS] Here inclosed also send the severall bills for the shipp[s] have been here since my last. There is the value of a bendy of gold I payed to Say and Ned, two of Captain Thomass Woodfines canomen, which J intreat you will to pay into your own hands for me. Here was an accident happened on a Cormanteen man named Quacco, an antiant inhabitant bere, who was murthered by a Mind [= Mine] man named Andaoma , who stabd the said Quacco severall times with a knife [so] that he dyed two or 3 bowers affter. The said mallafactor made his escape up to Poppo but was seiz'd there and brought down here. He confesed the ffact and said that another Mind man named Wooradoe sent him to Quacco to receive a debt, being tbe value ofa slave, and the said Wooradoo bid said Andaoma kill Quacco ifhe did not pay him, which be did, and was by the king and all the white men and all other the blacks here ajudg' d worthy of death. Accordingly his head was cut off in presence of Captain Poston, Mr Soomes, myself and several! others, also the Cabushers of the cuntrey . This attestation the freinds of Quacco desires me to write, by reason Quaccos brother now lives with the GeneralJ of the Mind , as they tell me. Also Griffin is related to him also. [PPS] I could not possible perswade the canomen to come up soon after the departure oftbe Sarah Bondaventure, nither indeed was it tben weather. You may be assured what ever the canomen say or pretend, I never did soe nor will hinder their goeing but alwaies contrary posted them away with what speede I can, for I could send every month if possible if it were a marke of gold a year out of my own pockett for the conveniency. [PPPS, in margin] Pray order all ships that comes down not to trade at any of the places between the River Volto and this place, for it doth but encourage a parcell of runaway rouges that harbour there at Kitto .54 They destroyed Captain Payne and 7 of his people and endeavourd the boat also,55 and at Popo they joined with the slaves on board the Charlton sloope and rum [= run] here ashore, killd tbe Commander and all they could and took all the gold and slaves. 56 l hear you have a great many doctors on this coast and that doctor Walber is there. I should be highly obliged if your Honour would be pleased to spare him to come down here, with a man or two with him. 820. John Ca11er Whiddab , 6 Dec. 1686 Yesterday the boy retumd from Popo which carryed my letter of the 22d of November, and he tells me the cannoes are not gone , at which I am much troubled , for they migbt have been.at Cabo Corso 6 or 8 dayes agone had they went of from hence, but I could nott perswade them, but they promised me not to stay above 2 or 3 daies at farthest; and all there pretences is victualling cheap, there come being more plenty there then here; but I am certa in they spend more in lying there, then there whole provitions for there voyage would come to here. 1 pray you will be pleased to cast ise them, and for the future order them otherwise. l have now no canoes left, being all sent up and broke to peices, therefore advise that noe commander come unfurnished. I want a dozen good servisab lc musquetts and a cupple of good blunderbusses for the use of the ffactory for defence if occasion. 57 If our canoes are gon of from Papo before this getts up there it will goe by a M ine cano . 821. John Carter Whiddah , 20 Dec. 1686 This goes with the George Sloop, Richard Hobs comander, by whom I have sent 10 brave young Negroes men slaves on account of the Royall Affrican Company of England and according to your order. But for cloaths I have none , neither have I any goods to purchase any. I did send a letter and account &ca almost a month past by two canoes, who went up the river to Popo to goe off there, and they promised me not to stay above 2 or 3 days before they would put to sea. But now I hear they stayed above 3 weeks, and that by reason of 2 Mine canoomen that came with them. I request you will order ittthat noe Mine canooman may be suffered to come with ours, ffor they mle all ours, and I fancic are sent on purpose to play the rogue with us. They soe abused the Braffo 58 tha t came down in Captain Dailes that be was fforced to enter himse lf and goe home with the shipp for quitenesse sake. They cut him in 2 or 3 places at 2 severall times ffor being vigilant to serve his master better than they, and all the rest of the canoomeo sided with the Mine canooman, and I have always observed itt that I or 2 Mine canoomen shall rule all ours, which I wonder att, and 1pray beleive that I always send as speedily as 1can and never retarded a canoe since 1have been here , but on the contrary proffer great encouragement and assistance if they would retume speedily . Ffor the future please to order them to goe directly of from this place , and beleive what I write is the reall truth, and much more to the same purpose and worse, but shall des ist, only they are rogues. l wrote you in my last (that went by the 2 canoos, the 11 hand and the 7 hand) wherein I requested some more goods down , which I hope will come by next conveyance. I have since my last account put on board These, with the expenses of the Factory being halfe a year more at Christmas, will I thinke signify a great want of another supply of goods, which leave to your consideration. Captain Nehemiah  Walker  IO slaves  Captain Andrew Bran.fill  15slaves  and now in the George Sloop  10 slaves  35 slaves  822. John Carter Whiddah, 6 Jan. 1686/7 There hath been no opportunity that I could find or make since I came here, but 1 have wrote to Cabo Corso, and I have always by gifts and promises and threats endeavoured to perswade or force the canoomen to retwáne speedily , and oflate in particular Say and them that came in Captain Thomas Woodfine, but by no means would they goe till the hermitan. Now whatever excuse they or any other make or say to the contrary are lyes, and Tdesire you to believe the certain truth . When Say with the rest of the canoomen that went last up departed from hence , I made them promise and swear that they would not stay above 2 or 3 days at Popo , but notwithstanding they stayed above 3 weekes, and alJ tbe reason I could hear was because one Mind canooman that was amongst them would not goe any sooner and then when he did goe it was to serve the Dutch, for the Dutch Chiefe at Offrah paniard a man that stole their flagg and sent him up to Popo to goe for the Mine 59 and the whitemen finding no Minde canoe there forced our canoomen to take him in and carry him to their General!, which they readily obeyed without order or knowledge from me, and I believe the fear of displeasing the Generali of the Mine made them post away with the Negroe , so soon as they tooke him in. They said they had no room for any Negroes here by reason they had 4 shipp canoomen to goe up in their two canoes . All which I leave to your examination why the Cabo Corso canoomen hould stand in fear of the Dutch and be always governed by the Mine canoomcn. If there be but one Mine canooman amongst 11 or 15 I have always observed that he shall govern the rest. Captain Nanter arrived here the 26 December and hath 230 slaves on board from hence, and all the rest are in the Factory with 40 more if occasion served. His cargoe falls short and the more short by reason 6 barrels of his booges proved bigg, whereby was 6 slaves and more lost I tbinke. To help him a little what slaves he bas are very good and about 4 men to one woman , which will be welcome at Barbados. 60 God send him well there and his Negroes in as good plight as they goe aboard, and I am sure they are worth 21 £ sterling per head round , I am so confident in the goodne se. In my letters by canoes and by the George Sloope have requested some goods down, ffor I shall be ashamed to make up this last halfe years account. Per the canoes did send up a 12 months account , since which is now halfe a years expcnce charge and 40 slaves , and now more put on board the shipp here, and I suppose it will sound best in England that this Factory, where more slaves is shipt of then ffrom any one place in the world, 61 should be maintained by the Royall Company, it being theirs; ffor now am sure l have but a bare ffactory, and I thinke it great pity it should be so empty, for I believe tis the largest factory of accommodation both for the Companys servants and slaves on the Coast of Guyney, I mean of a house,62 and withal more convenient and secure. I can entertaine 5 or 6 ships cargoes, 6 or 800 slaves &ca, and secure all from thieves and fire in all probability, and the Factory is at the same expence as if all the shipps were consigned to the Factory. You write to know how Captain Walke r went away, and I answer very well from hence , and I put two slaves aboard him for the Companys account. I hope he may be well arrived in Jamaica afore this. Likewise the goods I received safely by Captain Thomas Woodfine, and I request the favour you will not charge me with neglect when tis as impossible for me to doe more than I have done in that particular, I mean oftener sending advise, as tis for me to traveU to England by land from this place, unless you can order the canoomen att a better rate or had not cutt the !eggs the Company gave me when I came out.63 My grief is sufficient, there needs no aggravation, and thank God for a good heart. I sent by Captain Hobbs 10 brave young men slaves according to your orders, but no cloths without goods. The goods I desire are booges: I suppose you have none, therefore iron bars; long cJoaths; white baffties ; pintadoes; allejars; scarlett cloath; broad blew cloath; read perpetuanoes; beads, purple, yellow, white ground, also bigg as rounsefuH [= rouncival] pease 64 &ca. This comes by I think a very honest man named Annamah living at Annamaboe, I have promis ' d you will be kind to him if be makes haste. [PS] Just now is going by a great Dutch ship. 823. John Carter Whiddab , 11 Jan. 1686/7 I had forgot to write an answer about Sir Benjamin Bathurst 65 till yesterday dispatching Captain Nanter your letter came to hand, therefore send this up to Popo after the canoe that if they be not gone, this may satisfy you. By the Mary had letters of creditt from the Company (it being my request) that what estate should be left in my hands of any deceased partyes (having not a convenient specia here to send home) might charge a bill on the Company for the value and give the Company creditt for the like value. Therefore did by the man of war the Orange Tree and the Mary send Sir Benjamin the accounts with a bill on the Company for payment of the money, which was 23£ 12s 6d after all debts and legacies paid, which I doubt not will be paid when demanded. Here inclosed have sent one of Captain Nanters bills oflading for 261 Negroe slaves, all choyce Negroes qualified as in the bills of lading, who now is under sayle this morning almost out of sight, God send him a speedy passage . I have [written] largely already, therefore shall not trouble you with more . [PS] Yesterday we gave ourselves the honour of drinking yours and your ladyes health, and likewise the Gentlemens of the Councill, with guns, the dispatch being sufficient to bare itt, may itt succeed so well to the end. We want some more shipps down, slaves beingplenty ,66 please to order them not to stay by the way, and send canoes and canooroen but more pa1ticularly canoes for we bad much adoo to patch up canoes to slave the African Pink. The Dutch bath done a very honorable thing for their countrey. (As I wrote you) our canoes carried up a Negroe ofOffrrah that cut their ffiagg downe at the sand , which I suppose he intended to steale and carry away, but being sent up to the Generall, I suppose by request of the Chief here , cut off his head , and sent thee great ship that was bound to Angola purposely down here with the head of the offender , and the said shipp came down wilh his fflagg at maine top, and as we heard him fire many guns, but what else is don I have not heard but suppose they bring it a shore guarded ,67 and what else may seeme to terrify the blacks and keep them in awe and fear to offend againe in such or the Like cases , as I hear more of it worth noating shall by the next opportunity infonne you of it. 824. John Carter Whiddab , I 6 March 1687 My last was by a canoman of Annamabo named Annomah , who promised to depart from Popo in 2 or 3 daycs at farthest. He seemed to be a mighty honest fellow , but now I here he is not yett gone, and the reason he did not goe [was] the Mind[ = Mine] people perswaded him his cano was to little, and therefore stay till they went. I have [sent] up for the letter by reason one of Captain Nanters bills of loading is [blank]. Sometimes the canomen will not go till such a time, and sometimes they will goe from hence and stay a month or two at Poppo, which is a great vexation to me and have been ever since I came here , and your letters have been like Jobs comfo1ters. I give you this relation that you may not think any negligence in mee . It was debated in England by the Company whether I, as being then ordered Cheife for this place, should have a dependance from Cabo Corso Castle or not , and twas conc luded l shou ld. The reasons given me, that in case of want of any supply I could have spedier recours to Cabo Corso than to England, both by the advice boat was sent with me and the often returning of canoes, wh ich was sattisfactory reason. But now I perceive I sbalJ have no supp l yes, not such as may maintain Factory expence. Where the fault lyeth , I know not I am sure tis not in me. If the Company hath given orders to the contrary, tis but just Tshould know of it. For all the loss of Iives, for a II the unnecessessary ex pence, if any, tis occasiond by the Company, for I did not move the Company to come here, only to spend their mony; but it was otherwise proposed to me, and for that reason the Company required a double security of a private Factor, and allowed me double the sallery, with a promis of advance. lam at the same expence , as if all the ships were consigned to my selfe, except the brandy for expending in buying of slaves, and that often lyeth parte upon mee too . Gentl emen , by the i.nclosed account you may perceive what quantity of goods remayn in the Factory, and that I have just cause to complayne; and if you will not please to send me no more I will doe my best endeavour to maintain the honour of the Royall Companys Factory here with what goods I have ofmy one[= own] and other peop les in my hands till I depart hence, which I hope in God may not be long, my three years being past considerable. 68 I will ask only God almighty's blessing for a fair opertunity and his good providence to protect me safe from th.is fataU and unfortunat e place of Ardra. Now Captain Briston [= Bristow] is an-ived but himselfe and Doctor very ill, but hope they may recover. They came ashore iU and went directly up to the IGngs Town, and lay one night, but was ill very bad, after that they went both on board againe. I perceive by the strangness of Coom1anders two of the las test when they first came here, that rhave some straog( e] i 11report spread of me, 69 which hath caused me to make a Little inquie1y, and I am informed that Say sho11ld tell some of the Counc ill of Cabo Corso goeing up to the Mine or at sometime that Captain Thomas Woodfinc and I bad a falling out and that he went sick aboard; such a thing might have been and I not to blame , but on the contrary we had no faUing out as I remember , and he went ve1y well on board and was so two dayes , if not more , before he sickened, and truely till the day he dyed I did not think him otherwise sick than with vexing at thee miscarridges of the cano kickatevoing 70 almost eve ry day, and drownding several! slaves, for we were told that every morning he stood on tbe quarter deck with his prospective[ = perspective] glass freeting and vex ing himselfe that the slaves could not be gott on board, for if it had pleased God the sea would have pennitted he had had all hi slaves on board and reddy to sayle by the time he first fell sick. 1 told him at his comeing fust ashore that if please God weather permitted he should have his slaves in 10 or 12 dayes at farthest. He was but one or two nights ashore in all and he was so much my frei.nd that he had been 200 if occasion had required . His welfare and hea lth was so esteemed by me that I would have hazard my health and life to have preserved bis. Gentlemen, beleive me to be so much a Christian that I abhor tbe thoughts of doeing or suffering any injury to be done by to my freind. It is more then I would have done to the worst enimy I have. If any such words have been utterd l beleive my man Unguah, who is kindred to Say, hath been the occasion , by reason I will not have him come down againe , hath wrought this forregery. I doe beleive formerly when our house was green, being now [= new] built, it might be a little unwbolsome, but now as it is I am confident tis as wholesome as any house in the cuntrey , and as convenient and as moderate drinking. Captain Walker went well away Captain Branfill, the same Captain Poston the same Captain Somes the same Captain Hobs tbe same Mr Hereford the same Captain Nanter the same Captain Gilbert the same Captain Hosea the same Captain Crookshanks the same Captain Daile I suppose never well.71 These went all well away, God be praysed, and lay all their time at our house, except Crookshanks lay 2 nights at the Kings towne. I cannot gain say or argue against the providence of almighty God, but thank God my contience is clear from willfuJI ingury to any man in the world, and as Agent Bradly use to say if any man wishes or endeavours any injury to any man liveing, may the same misfortune happen to himselfe. [PS] I am troubled 1 am continually constrained to write such epistles not tending to business. Here inclosed comes my last account to Christmas last, and if! have no more goods shall be trobled to write no more accouts, so shall be eased of that troble . AJso comes here 3 bills of loading from Captain Gilbert , Captain Hosea and Captain Crooskshanks . I have all along furnished the canomen with brandy and tobacco and palm oyle, and most commonly cables and anchors, and never bad one returned againe. That graplin you sent by Captain Thomas Woodfine , Mr Attwell 72 wrote me word he sent it by Say and one for themselves to, but they keept both. These canomen now l furnish with brandy, tobacco, palm oyle, wood and some other little necessaryes, as stockfish, beef, pease &ca. If you send the said Say of[ = off] a slave you will doe a Christian act and justice to the deceased Captain Woodfine , for his canoman were all strangers here but Say, and Captain Woodfines whole dependa nce was on bis abillity and care, but after Captain Woodfine went on board he [ = Say] neve r would stirr off in the cano but stand ashore and se the cano kickativoo, and when Mr Attwell, who was there for he went alwaies to the waterside, saw the miscarr idgcs and scolded at Say for not goeing off, Say laughed at him. Then Attwell told me and I threttened him and designed to have fully acquainted Thomas Woodfine and likewise write to you, but he took little notice off itt. He is so great a rouge that if you doe not send him off, I will ifhe comes here while I am here. I have strove much to perswade these cano men to goe off hence and now I se their store of flower all is not above a sheet chest full, which they have cheaper at Popo by about l. [lbs] bouges or 2 lb at most, and that they should goe and go there a month to save that is strange to me. It trobles me that you should have so Little Christianity as to think me guilty of the least thought of such villaney. I never gott but one ring, that was at one Commanders buriall, I think my namesake, but have lost, I think, by all, especially by Thomas Woodfine . Had he lived it had been 20£ short in my way, but lam not so mersenary as to vallue that equall to the life and enjoyment of my freind which was honest Thomas Woodfine , whose death I now lament and all that have dyed at this place. I conclude with this scripture phraise, the Lord doe so and more to one [= me] ifl have done or know of any such injury done to any person since I came to Whiddah, neither doe I beleive any such thing have been done unless twere to Doctor Gates, Edward Hill and my selfe when we were at warrs with these peop le.73 [PPS) March the 23d 1686/7. Captain Bristow is dead , but I hope the doctor may recoverr. We that live tis almost in missary, alwaies one distemper or another, that we deserve more pitty than such aspersions as is tbrown upon us. Some at Cabo Corso have known me before, and I am sure I was never malletious and I hope .ever shall, and now at this instant could I meet with an oppertunity I shou ld be mighty willing and joyful! to serve any of you at Cabo Corso Castle, though you will not send me any goods. l have I think fully sattisfied you according to the truth of my heart and begg the favour of you that if ally such aspertions be spread abroad to put a period to them and doe them justice, and the God of justice reward you is the prayers of your afflicted servant , but 1 thank God honest as to men in the face of the sunn I can declare and so prosper. [PPPS] Between these two dates have the canomen stayd to gett flower from Popo. I thjnk twere well if you would please to order them to bring down flower with them. These canomen can inform you when that Annomab of Annamabo come up, that you may gett the letter from him wherein Captain Nanters bill of loading. 825. John Carter Wbiddah, 10 May 1687 Since my last to you by Occammy 74 I have been at Litle Poppo, and the towne where the canoos used to depart from is called Attome, being a few houses (or rather beehives only larger) standing on the sand by the sea side.75 There I saw Annomab the canooman, which gave me my letters aga ine which I have now sent. At this towne of Attome I with Mounsieur Couerden the French Chiefe , 76 who went with me, were received by Mounsieur John Poeselwitt, ffactor for the Branderburgh, 77 who hath dispatcbt two of their shipps from thence but wi ll no more I suppose. Mr Poeselwitt in respect to us put up his flagg, intending to make us as welcome as he could, and that day we went to see Offerry Grandy, the kjng of Accraa , who recides about halfe a myle ffrom thence, 78 and whyle we were there the blacks at the said towne tooke down Mr Poeselwitts fflagg and put up a Dutch fflagg, at which affront to our ffriend we returned immediately from the town and pulled down the Dutch fflagg, intending the Branderburgs ffiagg up againe, but soon after another Dutch fflagg was up, noe Dutch men ever reciding there, onely by now perceive them all Mine people , or at least the rulers. 79 Whi le we were arguing the reason with the Captain of the towne, Dutch fflaggs were put up at severall houses to the number of six. We had no pretence to the place, but immediately tooke our things and departed with our canoes to Offeryes, the king, and I lay their that night. The next day went to Sofferyes or Offery Occammyes , that is about 2 or 3 myles more windward, we generally call him Sofferry Pickaninnee, who is the Generali of the Accraes and lives in much more &,>Tandeiur than the king, having all ways a good strength of soJdjers at his command, and the river comes up to his croom, having 5 times the houses thatt is att the towne of Attome, and lives in the midway betweene the sea and the river, and the sea is about a quarter of a myle .80 He proffered me, ifl would send the canoes to take their departure at hjs place , he will hall over the canoes to the sea and furnish them with all necessaryes for their voyage and always speed them away. He is a person much afore the king for wisdome, valour &ca, very solid and very honest by all report. I thought him a :fittperson to secure, and have now sent a canoe to fetch him down to take a fetish to serve the Royall Company only, and shall give him a Companyes fflagg and a letter to any of the Companyes ships that shall have an occasion to stop there, and they shall apply thems.elves to him and not to the Mine people. They always abuse the English, twas these Attome people that got all the Charletoon sloops gold, or else we had gott some of that againe. 81 lf l can secure this Saffery Pickaninny , be is more than all the peop le of those parts and can do as he pleases. He shews a respect to the king of Accraa, but the king is nothing without him and they are as brothers. 82 The rest J leave the canoomen to informe. Just after l bad wrote this I was told tbat the Generali of the Mine had sent the said Soffery Pickaninnee a letter about 3 weeks afore, and that the letter was sent by Soffery to the Chief at Offrah , who invited Soffery down to him, 83 the truth of which I have now sent up my boy Cuffee to know, and whether he will be tme to our Company. Ifsoe I will ingagc him as firm as I can, for we stand in need of him (I now perceive) on the account of our canoomen, ffor if the Dutch gett him, there is no passage out of the river but by this man and the Attome people; and the pride and insolency of the Dutcb is not pleasant and the Mine blacks take after the Dutch , they have all along stopped our canoes and our canoomen will nott or dare not complaine . I herewith send 5 bills of lading of the last shipps that went away, all having quick dispatch some 14 days , 15 and the longest 20 days. The succeeding Comander of the Lucitania 84 notwithstanding I furnished him with a canoe to slave him, by reason bis canoe was too long and not so ready to goe of here, at his going away sold his canoe to the interloper without speaking the least word to me of selling itt. When I heard of it I told him twas unkind not to offer me the refusall , since I had lent him a canoe to slave his shipp gratis, so at last he sold her to me, and now the canoomen having no canoo fitting to carry them up I lent them this 9 hand canoe to carry them up, and request your honour will please to order her downe againe by the I st conveyance, she being mighty convenient for the river here . Quavoo hath promised me to take care of her but I cannot depend on that. Here is few canoomen here and no canoes to depend upon. We have now no goods in the Factory of the Companyes , however I will not be wanting to dis[c]harge my duty to them . If it be possible that the canooman Say hath spoken words to that high degree of mischiefe , I request so much Christian justice (if heathenism doth not predominate at Caho Corso Castle above Christianity , for ought I can bear great creditt is given to the single report or whisper of a heathen rascall) I request the áaid Say may be punished according to his desarts and sent off or down here . The villany is to hard for me to bear, that such report shall be forged and I cannot come to give better satisfaction . How many times have I requested a vessel down here to come up and cannot be granted , and I will not be a boy to come up in a canoe. God bless all people from such hard fate . 826. John Carter Widdah , 29 Aug . 1687 This goes by a Dutch small sbipp , which is come downe purely for their packen or papers , and soe to rettume , by reason noe canoe can come up at thjs time, and I beleive twill be more than a month before I sh al I perswade any of them to goe. By them shall send all bills of loading &ca . The Maynard with the Captain and Agent ,85 and Captain Thompson and the George Sloope all were here and went well away , but the Agent was gon before the sloop came downe here , but Captain Thompson and the sloope sayJed together the 6th of Augu t86 and the Maynard the zgth July before. Captain Thompson bad don noe buisiness before the Maynard came downe by reason of loytring by the way. The Agent was but two days after him and in 8 dayes had his departure . Captain Thompson had gonn sooner but his canoe was broake, and I have none here, therefore pray order all shipps to bring canoes, and please to send my nine hand canoe downe, that I sent [var. lend] the canoemen up in. In hast. 827. Petley Wybourne Whiddah, 18 February 1688 Am honoured with yours of the s¥hof January last past, and meeting with this occasion of the advice yaghl from the Mina could not omitt but to let you know how all things are, and to ren der you all my most humble and hearty thanks for me and my companys most kind and courteous entertainment with you, 87 for which shall be glad to meet with an oppertunity of retaliation. The shipp Hannah , Captain Cowley, arrived here in this roade the 13th of January last past and is not yet dispatched , by reason few or noe good slaves to be obtained , after any rate whatsoever, 88 so choose rather to keep her here at my charge 89 than to let her go away to my discredditt with bad and unfitting slaves to proceed a voyage, which if wou ld have undertaken might have been gon ere now, and hope now within a week will happen , and then shall send the charter party. 90 The shipp Mary paited from hence the 4th of this instant with Mr John Carter, who left me possession of an ill contrived and rambling ruinated Factory, without any effects of the Companys elce. I see by yours that the shipp Elizabeth, Edmund Batheme Comander, is arrived on the Coast, which am glad to see. The Brandenburgh shipp called the City of Berlin, Jan Reyne successour of Simon de Leon, was taken at Grand Popoa the 19th of October last, by a Dutch man of warr name d the Golden Greyhound, Ffredr ick Ffredriekson Comander, and will be a very good prize to him.91 The shipp the Tempest, a French man ofwarr, Monsieur Du Cas Comander, is come to take in slaves here, and arrived the 131h currant, 92 and the same day passed by a small Dutch sbipp, bound for the Benin, and tbe next day, the 14th of this instant passed by the advice yaght for Ofrah, per whom this comes. [PS] Lame of the gout. 828. Petley Wyboume Whiddah, 5 March I 688 The above is coppy of my fo1mer. Since have received yours per the Elizabeth Captain Edmond Batheme comander, of the 25th last past, with the charter party, which shall send forward when he departs.93 Have ordered per this conveniency Mr John Downes to purchase me what canoes he can gett, for which would intreat you to disburse what money soever they come to, and for your reimbursement be pleased to draw on Mr Johnson Esq at the Affrican House in Leadenhall Street, and Mr Anthony Palmer, Linnen draper, at the signe of the Wool Pack in the Minories, 94 where your bills shall all receive due honour.
