VIII QUASHE'S CROOM (AMISA) Amisa ('Amersa', 'Amasa') is the name of a lagoon , with an outlet to the sea, 9 kmeast of Egya; 1 but in the seventeenth century it was also applied to a village inthe vicinity. In the 1690s this village was also known as 'Quashe's Croom[Kwasikrom]' , after the name of its ruler. Although frequently mentioned in theRawlinson correspondence in the 1680s and 1690s, Amisa was not the site of anyRAC factory .2However, in June-July 1695, the Company' s agent Edward Barterspent several weeks at 'Qua he' Croom', from where he sent the seven lettersincluded here. Amisa is usually mentioned in the Rawlinson correspondence inrelation to the collection of oystershells (which were burned to make lime forbuilding work);3 and on a couple of occasions in the 1680s as a site for trade inslaves.4 Barter ' s mission in 1695, however , was to buy corn. Lik Anashan,Anomabu and Egya, Amisa belonged to the state of Pante; hence, while Barter wasthere, its chief Quashe visited the Fante capital inland for his brother 's burial(no.1048). 1043. Edward Barter Amasa, atl Quashe' s Croome, n.d. [early June 1695) These serve only to advise your worships of my proceedings . At my arrivallI delivered my message according to your wor hips order, and gave [the)Cabbosheers rum, & then began my palaver for corn, & find here is corn enough,but verry dear. The Portuguez gave them 3as 6t for a chest, and that said chest is cutt almost half way downe , that it does not come to two third of a chest, & we couldnotagree about [ms. 'above') the price of that chest, but [with) much adoe I broughtthem to a right sheet chest full for 4a, & under they will not sell a graine they say, but that is a great deal better than the other chest for 3.a, but they will not heap it up, so desire your worships further order, & if pleased to send the canoe [with) the bagges as soon as your worships please, for I have 20 chest already by me. PS. The ship that sayld yesterday was the great English enterJoper. 1044. Edward Barter Amasa, Quashes Croome, 8 June 1695 Yours of the 7th instant have received, & find here is come enough to be gott for mony. I have been almost as low as Quansa ' s croome,5 & cal'd at every croome & found considerable quantitys of com at most of their croomes, & have engag' d them to b1ing it to Quashes crome , by reason there is no ladeing a canoe thereabouts, & [they are] verry well satisfied to bring it to Quashes crome, but not a corn without mony, they canot endure to hear of goods by no means. I have already by me 200 chests ready measur' d,6 & stay for nothing but payment, so desire your worships answer, or if you please to send mony, Quashee has sent one of his men on purpose to guard my men with the mony. The 5 hand canoe is come safe on shoare, & as soon as have your answer shall load her & send her up. 1045. Edward Barter Quashes Croome, 14 June 1695 Yours of the l l th instant I received, with six ounces gold, which I shall endeavour to lay it out at the best advantage, but before I received your worships, I sent to Annarnaboe for two chests sheets,7 whjch I have disposed of for mony, & have paid for all the come that I have bought, which is 29 chests, & yesterday finding the sea to be verry well, loaded the 5 hand [canoe] with 14 chests, all in basketts, & in goeing of was overset & all the come lost, every corne in the canoe [omission?] staved, meerly t[h]rough the canoemen s means, & if Captain Peter had pickt aU Cabo Corso he never could have pickt out worse canoe men, for there is not one good canoe man an1ongst them, and they deserve to pay for all the com that was lost. This place is a place that the best canoe men upon the Coast should be pickt out for, & Captain Peter knows that verry well, soe [I] thought fit to hire the canoemen of this place, Quashes 5 hand canoe have sent 7 chests in her, and if your worships think fitting t'is best to hire the bearer hereof, to bring all the rest of the corn that I shall buy here . Sirs, the people here desires me to send for some silk longees, & they will bring corn for them, so if your worships think fitting desire to send some. 1046. Edward Barter Quashes Croome, 16 June 1695 15thYours of the instant have received , and am hartly sorry your worsrups should be so much misinform'd of your servant by those fellows, & Captain Peter shoul.d offer to say that I was the reason of their goeing off, for where I am of buying of the come is as far from the water side as from Cabo Corso to Winneybah or the sal.tpond head,8 nay more then all that. I have been so well use'd to those & other canoemen that if I am sent uppon any such theing as I am upon now, always to give them their own time, if they have but an empty canoe that was good for any thing, and [I] do say yet that when your worships comes to be rightly enformed that you will make them pay for the corn yet, for the sea went hire [ = higher] for two or three days, and they were verry uneasy , & that times when they oversett the seas were ven-y good , & that they would go of, so I went downe with [ms. 'whit'] them the second time , which was the same day they went up to the croom & told me that the seas was verry good , & that there was a 5 hand canoe goeing of with them, & that they would goe of, & that canoe was Quashes canoe , [the] same that came up with the com, she was going on board the Portuguez that were goeing by us , so I went downe with them , & gave the other canoe men three taccoes to take som of the come in & to go of before them & show them the way , so they went of together. Quashe s canoe whent throw [ = tlu-ough) verry well, not so much a sbipt any water in her. They also followed them, & when they came just in the place where the ea broake , they all lay'd their padles downe , & lay there a considerable time, till the sea came & fill'd them full, nay if they had jumpt over board & supported the canoe of each side she had never oversett, butt they all sett [ = sat] still till she turned over upon their heads, & when they came ashore [I] askt them what [omission). The reason of my beating one of them was because he would not help to carry the corn up to the croome that was wett with the waeter , he told me he came to paddle & not to carry come , & I could not gett them to carry come at all. As for my desireing the people to carry come to Annimaboe, I have done my endeavour with Quashee , but they will not comply with me by no means , & I have defered buying any more corn till I have your worships orders. I have now 20 che t by me, & hall obey your orders in sending up the corn with all necessary speed. 1047. Edward Barter Qua hes Croome, 16 June 1695 By this canoe comes IO chests corn in 22 baskett . Lickewise 12 che t remaining, which shall endeavour to send up by the next canoe. Here is corn to be gott, butt with taken [ = talcing] much paius,I not begrutching [ = begrudging) my labour of the least. Here is hardly a chest of com but I am fore' d to pay for it before they will bring it here. I go at least everay day 7 or 8 miles, & gett here & there ache t, ome places 4 or 5 chests, & pay for it, & then they bring it to my croome with me. I have with Quashes done what we could to gett them to bring it to Annimaboe, but they wi11not comply to my desire. Have almost a whole chest of sheets by me and am promised corn for them. PS. These canoemen, the bearers hereof, goes of verry well, so desire to know whether I shall send any com of in the Companys canoe. They say your worships ordered them to ley of, & me to hire 2 hand canoes to bring the corn to them, which will come to more than comeing to Cabo Corso. 1048. Edward Barter Quashes Croome, 4 July 1695 Yours of the l s' I received on the 2d, being up at Fanteen 9 buying of come, by reason of Quashes goeing with most of the people thither to bury his deceased brother, & so told me I might gett come there, where I gott 5 chests, & should have come upon sight [of your letter], but was desireous to see the 5 chests come goe with me. I have gott a verry violent feavour upon me at this present, else should have come up at this present time. Tomorrow shall desire the doctor of Annimaboe to come & bleed me. The people here are verry slack to bring old come in, so desire to know whither I may buy new come at 2[a] per chests, for that is as cheap as I can gett it for, I have tryed all the ways immaginable. Not advieseing your worships before the 11 hand canoe was because I observed your worships orders of the letter dated the 18 June, so have sent the 11 hand canoe with 7 chests, haveing no more by me. The 11 hand canoe would no[t) come ashore, so sent it in 2 hand canoes. 1049. Edward Barter Quashes Croome, 21 July 1695 By the 5 hand canoe comes 11 chests come. The reason of not sending before was in getting the come in the canoe, being verry new, my self makeing the best of my way upp by land according to order, have engaged a good many people to bring come to Annamaboe as soon as dry.
