XII ALLAMPO (ADANGME) 'Allampo' (nowadays usually rendered 'Adangme') was the name of a people occupying the coastal area between Accra and the River Volta, 90 km to the ea t. In the seventeenth century, they formed a kingdom, with its capital at Ladoku.1 Allampo is frequently mentioned in the Rawlinson cone pondence as a site of trade. Kpone, 30 km east of Accra, where the Dutch established a factory in 1697, served as a base for trade with it (no.922). According to other contemporary evidence, however, the main place of trade in Allampo was a town caJ!ed Le ('Lay' etc.), nowadays Leponguno, 25 km further east;2 this name does not occur in the Rawlinson corpu , but it is presumed that references to 'Allampo' as a coa ta! port relate to it. There was no RAC factory in AJlampo in this period. But the Company's agent Edward Barter traveled from Accra to spend severaJ weeks there in Augu t-September 1694, as reported in these two letters, and received proposals for the establi hment of a factory, though these were evidently not proceeded with. 3 Allampo was mainly important as a source of slaves, but it was also noted for the rai ing of cattle, which were traded west to the Gold Coast.4 Barter, in fact, went there specifically to purchase cattle. However, he also reported on its commercial potential more generally, including the possibility of trading for gold, as well as slaves. Allampo in this period was dominated by Akwamu ('Quamboe'), which also controlled Accra; hence Barter in 1694 negotiated about the projected factory with Ado ('Addoe'), the co-ruler of Akwamu, as well as with the local authorities. 1340. Edward Barter Allampo, n.d. [early Aug. 1694) These serves only to advise your Worshipps that the King & natives here are very desireous for your Worshipps to settle a Factory here, and have been dunning me ever since I have been here, and would never lett me be att quietness, soe thought fitting to acquaint your Worships therewith. As for trade, here is very good trade for slaves & money, particularly slaves. Had I been only to bought ( = buy) slaves, I might [have] bought 3 or 4 hundred since I have been here, and I am certaine if I had but good goods I might have taken above one hundred bendeys, for here is a country that lyes near here, between this & Quamboe, that trades with money & has it plenty, but cannot goe to Accra by reason of the Quamboers, and they correspond with noe country nor Cabbosheers without it be with Addoe of Quambo e or their pe-ople, and Addoe hath sent here to me twice & has promised to give pawns with the King of this place which is considerable, either their sons or two hundred bendys, and has promised as soon as answer comes from your Worships he will come down himself. Upon the perusall your Worships will send a flagg by the bearer & a little brandy for a sirrup, if it be but a pint. Here are oyster shells in abundance within half a quarter of a mile of this place, and stones & wood in abundance. They promise they will fetch shells, stones & wood, and help to doe anything the white man your Worships shall plea se to send will command . The people here are very civill, for you may Jett your things lye anywhere [blank], for they worship a white man more than they doe their feteec hes. As for cows I am forct to send over the River of Vulter for, and am informed by the Cormanteen people here5 that it is not a usual I custome to doe.6 My peo ple is not yett come hither as yett, should (have] sent your Worships word else. The Dutch has been [at]tempting much since I came for to settle a flagg here, but the aforementioned Addoe advised them not to Jett them come there, but rather the Portuguizes first, and according as your Worships thinck fitting and send a flagg, they will send up pawns by me when I come, which will be about three weeks or under. I have had great trouble with the goods to putt them off, by reason of their being soe much damaged. The names of the countrryes where the trade come s from are as followeth [blank]. 7 The reason that Addoe as aforementioned corresponds with these people, is because he ( whenever your Worships bui Id a Fort here) is to have half the sallary & customs, for the three forts at Accra belongs to !he King of Quamboe. 8 Shall advise your worshipps further when I gett more paper or come my self. PS. I desire your Worships to send me a little paper by retwán, for all my paper was wett & I had but one sheet when I came on hore . Here i a very good landing place. The Blacks here are at charge of canoe hire themselves . 1341. Edward Barter Allampo, 24 Aug. 1694 Yours of the 21th I received , and according to your Worshipps order I have sent what sorts of goods are best here for purch ase of slaves is bouges, brawles , tapseles, white long clothes, blanketts , iron barr s, white potkeys, powder, blew bafts of a deep blue, Turkey carpetts blue, all the aforementioned goods if good mixt one with another, but if the least hole in them they will not have them. As for slaves here are enough, for here was a Dutch interloper commanded by Francis Johnson, who came to an anchor here on the 10/13 instant9 at evening and purchased 120 laves with blue baffts, carbines & bouges, had his choyce of slaves & sayled the 15th instant about 5 of the clock in the evening. Your Worshi.ps of the 21th should have mett me upon my return, 10 which your servant i ve1y sorry he did not answer your Worships expectation. The reason is the cowes I sent to b[u)y over the river cannot pa over for the great quantity of raine which hath lately fell here , but expect them every day. As soon as come hall deliver them to MrJohn Bloome att Accra, and make the best of my way up to your Worshipps according to order. 11 As for the flagg [sent] to me according to the request of the Blacks here, has not as yet been lett fly, for just as I received it here came a canoe from Cormanteen to bye cowes, which they frequently doe, and the Captain of the canoe named Arnesanee informed the natives here that if the white men once gott footing here that they would use them very hard , and debarr them from all priveleidges , and end them off the Coast upon any small account. 12 They being very fearfull people, refused then to have it, and their joy was turned then to greife. I informed them otherwise , that pallaver then was over, then came Capt. Francis Johnson, & Peater that padled his canoe told them that if they did suffer the Englishmen to settle there, that they must not expect to sell any more slaves aboard of any ship but English. He little knows I have heard of it. H comes in company of the bearer hereof.
