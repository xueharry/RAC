III ANASHAN The RAC's factory at Anashan ('Anishan'), east of Cape Coast Castle, had beenestabl ished probably in the late I 670s. 1 ft was still in existence at the beginning of1681, and correspo ndence from it is continuous until November 1682; althoughthis is not explicitly stated, it was presumably then abandoned. 2 The Anashanfactory supplied relatively small quantities of gold, and occasional slaves; but thecorrespondence suggests that its principal function was to supply corn to provision slave-ships (and also timber, for building works at Cape Coast Castle).There was also a Portuguese factory at Anishan, founded in 1680,3 which isoccasionally alluded to in the letters from the Englis h factory.4 As reported else.where in the RAC corresponde nce (no.322), this Portuguese factory was aban.doned in 1683. Anashan, together with the RAC factories at Anomabu and Egya and the Dutchfort at Kormantin further east along the coast, was situated within the state ofFante. 5 The Anashan factory correspondence contains little reference to its relationswith the larger state; though when the chief of Anashan in 1682 'sent up to theBraffoe' for guidance in his dealings with the English (no. 197), this presumablyalludes to the Obrafo, or commander -in-chief, of the Fante state. 6 The hinterlandmerchants trading at Anashan are always referred to as the Akani ('Arcanies'). 117.

I very much doubting that our goeing downe without the Quarranteer may prove to as little effect as when the greate canoe was there last, which I well understood from the people of that place, wherefore I thought fitt to acquaint your Honour herewith, expecting an answer whether wee shall goe downe to Tanton Querry or only take the goods that are remaining here and soe returne to Cabo Corsoe. 208.
