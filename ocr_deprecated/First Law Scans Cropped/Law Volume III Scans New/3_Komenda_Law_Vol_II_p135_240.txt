III KOMENDA Komenda ('Comenda ') is 30 km east of Sekondi, 20 km west of Cape Coast. The RAC's factory here had been abandoned in 1688, when the town was attacked by forces from Elrnina allied to the Dutch. 1 An attempt to reoccupy it in 1691 was withdrawn in the face of local hostility , as recounted in the first three letters of this correspondence. The factory was, however , successfuUy re-established from November 1694. There was already a Dutch fort in Komenda (Fort Vredensburg) , which is frequently referred to in this correspondence. A quarr el between the Komenda people and the Dutch provided the opportunity for the English re.establishment there in 1694, which in turn provoked a protracted Dutch-Komenda war, which drew in several other African states as allies on either side.2 Komenda belonged to the kingdom of Eguafo ('Aguaffoe'), 3 the current king being named in this correspondence as 'Taggee [Takyi]' or 'Great Taggee ', i.e. 'Tak yi Senior ' .4 A leading merchant of Komenda, who had been the principal local supporter of the English until 1688, was John Cabess; and it was again with him, a weU a with the king, that the English negotiated for their abortive establishment in 1691, and who played a critical role in their definitive re-settlement in 1694.5 As against the English alliance with Great Taggee, the Dutch from 1696 supported his dissident younger brother, 'Little Taggee ', or 'Takyi Junior'. In 1698, when Great Taggee was thought to be becoming too friendly with the Dutch , the English contrived hi murder on a visit to Cape Coast Castle . Little Taggee tlJen claimed the throne, now with the support of the English, but by the end of the Rawlinson correspondence in February 1699 the succession struggle was stiU unresolved. Komenda had earlier been a major supplier of gold, but this trade was disrupted in the 1690s by the recunent local wars. In the 1680s the main traders bringing gold from the interior to Komenda had been the Akani,6 but they are no longer mentioned there in the 1690s. In 1691 the principal merchants at Komenda were from Twifo ('Quiffera' etc.), to the north (no.263); but this trade was interrupted by the Dutch-Komenda war, in which the Twifo initially took the side of the Dutch, in whose interest they attacked Eguafo in 1695. Perhaps in consequence, in 1695 the Komenda authorities negotiated with Adorn ('Adoome'), to the north-west, to open a trade (no.332); but Adorn in turn then allied with the Dutch, to attack Eguafo in 1696. During the period of relative peace which followed, trading links with the interior were restored: by 1697, traders were again coming to Komenda from both Twifo and Adorn (no.384), and gold was also coming from Denkyira ('Dankara', 'Dancra'), in the remoter interior (no.389). Slaves were evidently as yet only of secondary importance in trade at Komenda, although in l 695, following local fighting, significant numbers were offered for sale (nos 333-5). 263. William Ronan Commenda, 30 Nov. 1691 The Cabbosheers and Quifferars are well affected,7 but John Cabesse, being now a creature of the Dutch, will not suffer us so much as to make a negroe house untill he has sattisfactio n for 8 bendys & . he sayes Mr Elwes owes him. 8 After I put up the flagg he sent his people to take it down. I sent yesterday morning expressly to Great Tagge, but is not as yet returned. The Dutch coopman sayes that he has orders from the Generali not to suffer the English to bring any great gunns here. If Great Tagge wilJ not stand by us the Royall Company will loose their interest here, so that you must send to him immediatly, as also endeavour to appease John Cabess. I am forced to take my habitation within our bare walls, and John Cabess threatens to turne us out. I will keepe the great canoe till I heare further. Just now I received a message from Little Tagee, thinking we had been all selled, I returned him to his master to send him to Great Tagee. Without appeaseing John Cabess am afraid nothing will be done. Just now arrived the express from Great Tagge saying he will be here tomorrow, and ordering me to advise you to writte to the Generali of the Mina in order to send for himself, that he may be sattisfied that we are all in ami ty and friend hipp, likewi se to let him know how much you will allow him per month ground rent , & he wiU come downe himself and see the Castle fit1ished. You may take notice that they are afraid to owne us till we are in a capacity to protect them. Our house does not want so much but it may be soone in a condition to argue our priveledges with the Dutch. Severall of the Quiffers has been here this day. All sorts of English goods will ell here if we had a place to secure them. Th y are all for finishing the house immed iatly. I am just now agoeing to meet another messenger from Great Tagge about two mile of, he being afraid to be seen by the Dutch. John Cabess is verry abusive, and beat some of the canoemen. 264. William Ronan Commenda, 30 Nov. 1691 This accompanies the 13 hand canoe with Luke Gale the carpinter, who can tell you what is wanting. John Cabess begin to change , and will be satlisfied to have his sallary as formerly , with a promise to be true & faithfull to the English , if you come to some agream nt about his last demands . He and Great Tagge hangs upon a string, so that if he [=John Cabess] is sattisfied wee shall have no opposition. Great Tagge desires that what has been and will be given him may be kept secret. They are all slaves to the Dutch & want only a protection to free themselves . He will doe what he can possible for hi ground rent , desiring to know what you will allow him monthly. When 1 see him hall show him the fo1mer contract. 265. William Ronan Commenda, 2 Dec . 1691 Just now Great Tagge surrounded us with his armed men & demanded sattis.faction for the follow ing particulars, vizt for 64. bendies with 22 slaves he spent in the last Fetue warrs, 9 of which he sayes that Mr Humfryes has 22 slaves & 20. bendys of gold. Also he demands the following pawnes left with Mr Samuel Humfryes, Mr Rice Wight & Mr Boy[l]sto n, of which Mr Wight & Mr Elwes knowe verry well, to vizt three golden manelloes [=manillas ], one sword with golden handle & one string of broad fetishes, & sayes farther that if you will have any setlemen t here you must secure the following per ons in Cabo Cor oe Castle , vizt Baniacon , Am.inta, Ahenaco, Ahencoco & Han aby. They must have your ansewer before they will let us part this place, oe humbly de ire yon will consider the danger I am in. Send your speedy answer this night or early in the morning. I am afraid I must make a country voyage of it. 11 * * * * * 266. Thomas Willson 12 Commenda, 30Nov . 1694 These are to acquainte your worships that this mor[n]ing about five clock where [=were) arrived att Commenda and according to your worships orders I whent [= went] derectly to John Cabbess croom, where wee where kindly [received] by him and his people. He understanding that there was a Ducth interloper lying about Cabo Corso Castle, hath desiered me to acquai[n]te your worship that he hath sent seven ounces to buy armes, which he pretends is to secure us and him selfe from the Ducth, whome he doth protest never to be friends with them againe. Further he doth desier powder & shott from your worships and a flagg to hoist, and is desie1ious to have the old Castle built and more and is much importuning to goe to see our Castle, he goeing with me and his people promising no damage shall attend me, which I will not doe without your Worships further orders. Tagge is up in the countrey, he [=John Cabess] hath sent for him and wee expect him about twelve a clock. 267. Thomas Willson Commenda, l Dec. 1694 This morning the messingers came back from Tagge, who sent for his foure . cases of spierritts, and boath he and John Cabess desier your worships to send slaves to build a house by our Castle to dwell in and bricklayers to [go] on with [ms 'w''] the Castle, and would have them to land at our usuall landing place, at Great Commenda, 13 they promising no injury to be offered to them, they haveing sent souldiers in to Great Commenda to secure them. As for the Ducth I have never heard from them nor seen them. They would desier your worships to send the slaves as soone as possible you can. On Munday Ile send somepeople to ransace [= ransack) about our Castle. [PS] John Cabess would have your worships to send a great cannoe with theslaves and a 2 hand ditto with her, the great can noe to goe to Great Commendaand there bring to a[n] ancor, the two hand canoe to come oo shoore att hiscroome and to give him an accom pt of her arriva ll. 268. Thomas Willson Commenda, 2 Dec. 1694 The people are very urgent to have the slaves come presently. The King hathsent downe to John Cabbes to send to your Worships for the great cannoe with20 or 30 slaves and if you can spare some bricklayers. This day will come downfrom the King two hundred bricklayers, I say 14 souldiers, that the Caposheers ofCommenda Towne hath sent to John Cabbess, and desier that your people maycome presently to worke. John Cabbess thinks itt noe good palaver because theslaves do not come, all are very desierous. I had noe matter to trouble yourworships with, the substance of which I wrote before, but John Cabbess willnot let me alone writting further, he doth desire the canno may come away asthis night. 269. Thomas Willson Commenda, 4 Dec. 1694 This is to give your Worships an accompt that on the 31h instant I received yourletter, and the same day about five in the afternoon John Cabbes s and yourWorships boys and a smal l parcell of his people went over the salt ponds to alittell house where the Ducth keep a small guard where they digg for gold, as theBlacks say,15 and about seven a clock they came back and brought with themfive Duchmen, one of them being a Copeman, the other foure soulders, theCopeman and one of the soulders stark naked, the other[s) had shirts on [ms.'one'] and draws [= drawers], but I doe not hear that they did hurt anyboydy as Ican understa nd, and with them all the plunder of that place, as cheas t [= chests),bundles, armes, sheep, goate &ca. 16 This mor[n)ing the Blacks are bringing allthere goods over from Commenda. John Cabbess will have me over to hiscroome which he lately burnt, where he and all will res ide not more, butt I referryour Worships to Quomminna who brings the letter, who will give yourWorshipps a further accompt. 270. Thomas Willson Commenda, 5 Dec. 1694 These are to acquaintc your Worship that I recevied your letter being dated the 4 instant with a flagg and the slaves. John Cabbess grumbles there comes noe rumm nor powder, and ask if you think a1lthese men doe not deserve drams. As for the powder he [is] not so hasty, for I see to the valew of 12 or 15 barrels which he purchased from the Brandenbourg, and doubtless there must be a time to make him restitution. Your worships in your last letter dated the 3rd instant would be advised what wood or water or landing place is neer or about the croome, the which I cannot, by reason I am not at that croome your worships may thinke I be. Aft.erwee landed at Commenda, being to windward of the town and Castle, wee carried our cannos over the sands and la[u]ncht in to a large salt pond, where wee ther[e] padled up about a mile and a . to a croome of John Cabbess, where there is nothing but a parcelI of houses where they make salte, a remorse L= remote) place some distance from the seaside, so that you can neaither see the sea, Castle [nor] Commenda Town. 17 Yams, wine &ca are carried to and fro in cannos in the salte pond from croom to croome, haveing severall croms. The croome as your worshipps means I should reside at is tile croome to which I am now goeing, which is situated by the seaside, by Commenda Towne, the Royal Companys old Forte, and by the Dueth likewise, at which croome wee must build the house, hoyst the Flagg att the Royal Companies old Castle, where when I come shall give your worships a further accompt. John Cabbess have some tragedom [=stratagem] in [h]is head, he often laughing and telling me he hath another trick to play, I know his meani[n]g by his mumping, 18 but I beleeve he wiJJ be decevied, therefore [fore]warned fore harmed[= armed). This croome we are a goeing to is all burnt down but 3 houses, John Cabbess burnt it when he had the first palaver with the Ducth: 9 PS. Your worships have one Peter in irons which John Cabbess and all the Cabboshecrs would have owt,20 all the country being for the English. Captain Peter will tell you the palaver, for there is such a tumult and noyse that noe mortiall [=morta l) can write before wee have a house and [arc] a little cNtl,-,-1 271. Thomas Willson Commenda, 6 Dec. 1694 Yours I recevied this mor[n]ing by Quamana , with the two pieces of sattine and powder. For your boys to see the Ducth , I am alltogeather ignorant of itt , for I know [=knew] not weather [= whither] they where agoeing nor what about, tell at night the Duchtmen came into the sheed where I was smooking by a littell fier, for John Cabbess had told he had an English Brinney21 and they should ee sum [ = ome] when they goe to his croome. For me to rule your Worshipp boy or the people hear is a thing imposible , for they are like soe many wild beast lett loose. Hear I live in a noisty [ = nasty] smooking hole, where I can neither lye , stand nor goe in it, and allwayes a tumultus noyse about my eares, and would I allow myselfe an ounce a day I could not in joy myselfe with it, I wi h [ms. 'wch ' ] it had not bin my charge [m . 'change'] to come heare, butt I hope your worships will releeve once a month. As for John Cabbe croomes your worships boys tell me they are all his, o that I know not what croome to keep att. Yesterday being 5 instant I came downe to another of John Cabbesss croomes which i the croome as I suppos[e] your worshipps meane, where when I came in sight of the Ducth Castell I aw they had made a witf [ = waif]22 with tbeire flagg and a boote [ = boat] came from the shipp that lyes theire, the Castle gate shutt up, the people in armes up apon the battlements , John Cabbess and King[s] people of the towne all in armes skulkin[g] up and down the bu he and town about the Castle wishing for muskett & shott, vowing if the Ducth fierd a shot they would take them. The Ducth sent to John Cabbess four severall times to make up the palaver , John Cabbess demands one hundred bendys. The boate came not on shoore butt whent on board againe , and how the business stands I know not. Thjs mor[n]ing being the 6 instant the Ducth fierd three shott att the Royal Companeys Castle, the first over the other two att the slaves as they where rowsawing. John Cabbess sent to know what made them fier, they said that the English should not live theire, John Cabbess aid they should, the Ducth sayd they will fiet [ = fight] him, and John Cabbess says he will fiet them. [PS] They are continually att me for rumm , John Cabbess saith he drinks none butt [it is] for the people . 272. Tboma Wilison Commenda, 8 Dec. 1694 Your Worships I recevied dated the 7 instant, with a quarter cask of rumm and gold. Yesterday arrived hear another Ducth srupp wherin they tell me is the General of the Mina. They did attempt to come on shore in the long boote and great canno, burl are not permitted, John Cabbess keep such strickt wact h night and day and suffers no letter to go on board and on shoore. John Cabbess would desier you to send him provitsions, as beef, hear being extrodinary scarce by reason noe people come downe butt souldiers nor no canno men go of afishing, but all beare armes. For my parte I have eate nothing but roisted l= roasted] yamms this three days, unless it where three small eonions, but I have sent to Forte Royle [= Royal] for provissions. [PS] Hear is never a flag stove [=stave J to be gott, so have not hoysted the flag, nor no wood to build Fort. Hear is a spting of water very neer. 273.

Yeasterday John Cabbess would have had me wrote a letter from him to the Captain , which not caring to doe [I] referred, as not [sic] being very sick of a feavour and soe I had bin for some dayes. He gott John Storey to write. Today he told me one of the shipps is att Taggeradoe, and [a] Pourtegeze in her companey, and that he had forty perpetuanoe owt of her. The Captains name he could not tell nor ship, but I beleve its trew. 283. Thoma s Willson Commenda, 23 Jan. 1694/5 15th mentioned, viz 4 cheast of sheets, 40 loose on[es], 3 pieces striped sattins, 30 carpetts and a bailes of boysadoes, 1 baile of perpetuanoes, 45 loose ones. On the 17th Captain Amo whent with them to the King of aQuaffoe and a yett is not rerume[d], and on the native [ = one of the natives] reflects on us [ms. 'as'] for being soe sloe [ = slow] in building the Company Forte, telling me the Ducth built theres in 3 moons times, which is a larger place to this. The carpenter saith that the girders are all fitted att Caho Corso for the lower woorke and [there will] be nothing done in bricklayers woorke till such time as is lade. Wee had from on board Capt. William Piles34 7 good gorders [=girders] and several ! joyces, timber enough for the upper woorke. If your worships would be pleased to send us halfe a hundred of men slaves wee might be gettin g of stone again t the bricklayer come up with crows and pikaxes for that purpo e. Newby the carpenter promised to speek to your worslupps for severall things, as lett [=slit] dale which would serve for the dwelling house for doors and windows and save the whole deale, instead of that hee hath carried away all the too1es with hjm in pretence of gitting them mended and grounded, soe that the carpenter Yours per Amo of the instant was recevied, with the things hearin heeare hath no tooles hardly to woorke with. Your worship please to send him downe againe, or some other carpenter to help this. Wee want a grindstone very much. John Brithoway is runn away to Cabo Corso Castle, as I think he swore he would goe home in these shipps, and that he would not woorke, and did not while he was here, what woorke was done the black bricklayer did. John Cabbess hath left a pawne with Capt. Roberts35 wheaing [ = weighing] tenn bendyes for the valew of 9 bendyes less one angle six taccoes in gold. His friends not being returned he would desier then that your worships would be pleased to send downe to reedeem itt againe, he nominated Mr Rootesey,36 and he will redeeme itt again, he would desier answer of itt. This comes by John Cabess canno, who hath buisness at Cabo Corso Castle. 284. Thomas Willson Commenda , 24 Jan. 1694/5 Your worships I recevied per John Brithower, and as conser[n]ing the woorke all that is done to the Companys Forte is in putting in seven door cases and five window cases, butt neeither doors nor windows nor window shutters, except one littell door where the carpenter keep his stores. The dwelling house is [ms. 'his'] tenna[n]table and with a marchant with his wares, whi.ch I should be glad to see, for I have bin at some charge heare, and dayly am with there palaver and Cabbess[' s] or one buis[ness] or other, haveing 3 doors, one window, one shutter, one table and bench and a house [sic]. The great hinges that where designed for the fort gate are putt on the yard gate, and one pair to the hall door in the forte. The deales are all gon except about halfe scor[e] which [are] nott good enough to make the forte gate, the carpenter saith. As for Amo, is still at Great Commenda with the King waiting for answer from the Densarces and Qurs, to whome they have sent the goods, 37 as they [ = the latter?] are down here, a parcell of them, every Friday, I say Tuesday, and would b[u]y goods, they tell me now the Quafferoe people and wee all one. As for the Ducth I cannot descover nothing, butt of old I know them to be circunventing [ = circumventing] people and would fained have us of againe, to which purpose have sent money to the Dansers and Quaffoe Twies [sic: = Quafferoes], if your worships are better informed then I can informe you. Before wee can gitt stone your worships may send up some crows and a great sieged[= sledge] hammer [and) wedges, and then we have but a parsell of puni slaves and shall make no great hand of itt. The carpenter would desier your worships to send up some whol deales and slats and iron hindges, a broad chiswell and a Littell saw, 3 quarter augors and a great plum[b] iron and grindstone, without which he cannot proceed. 285. Thomas Willson Commenda, 31 Jan. 1694 [= 1695] Your worships of the 24th instant wa recevied , with the iron woorke therein expres[ed] excepting one staple . Jame Driver the carpenter being very sick , haveing keept his bed this week or more, was desierou s to come to Cabo Corso Castle, is imbarqued on boord a cannoe in order thereunto. He hath not bin wel never since he hath bin hear, but very weake and faint, soe now wee have never a tradesman heare . The slaves are imployed according to order in gitting stone togeather. [PS] Mr Searle will do well to bring some tables downe with him, 38 for wee have never a table here. The carpenter was about the table when taken sick. 286. Edward Searle Commenda , 8 Feb. 1694/5 This morning about six a cloack I arrived here and wa received per John Cabbess and the Cabbosbeers of the place & made verry welcome per them , particularly John Cabe . So soon as I was ashore I di patched a messenger to the King of Aquafoe to acquaint him of my arrivall, who ent downe his people to bid me welcome and verry earnestly requested workeman to goe on with the Forte, which he expected I had b[r]ought with me, and understanding to the contrary, said that if the Dutch had halfe the palaveras they would have had guns upon their fort ere this tyme, and that I hould dispatch a canoe purpo ely to acquaint you that he is verry earnest to have us fortifie our selves , that we may be in defence against all the friends of the Dutch. John Cabess and the rest of the Cabbosheers were verry earnest with me on the same account, and that they will assist you with stones or any thing they can, and as I understand by them they are doubtfull 39 of the Quiferas , the Dutch endeavouring to bring them downe to tume us out. I question not, if you can suply us with men and materialls, but before the rains to raise the fort of defence against any Negroes that shall asault us. If in very few days we have not workman the natives will be verry much disatisfied, and those that would be our f1iends may be forced to fay le us for fear of the Dulch. The timber for the lower floor I under tand you have ready framed, and for the upper floor I beleive here is almost uficeint here, which if this [is] raised would stop the mouthe of the Blacks, we could better fortifie our selfes, and I hope tomorrow night or a Munday morning you will send men and materialls, that we may not slip any opportunity, for all the people are verry much disatisfied that I did not bring workmen with me. I have sent a broken maul and desire three maulls , two crewes [=crows], two pick axe , for the breaking of tone. Alsoe I have sent a man slave which has been blind a Jong time, and I humble desire more slaves, Ju ty men for the breaking of tone, 38 T"I. and the free people will bring them [i.e. stones] to the fort, I supose for some small dashes , but as yet have made no [ms. 'ne'] palavra with them. I desire a table, a cott and a great chest which is in the possession of Mr Salmon40 by first canoe, of which I stand in great need of, here being only row [ = raw] wans, the slaves haveing nothing to doe for want of mawles to break stone. John Cabess did as good as tell me yesterday that if did loose possession again it was our owne faulte, and that we _could never have the licke opportunjty. He says all the Blacks say it is he that has brought the Englisch hither, and it has cost him abundance of money and it will be a continuall charge to him till the fort is upp, the meantime he has noe place to fly to for protection , [and that the] Dutch are continua]y offering him dashes and lickewisse the same to Great Taggee to turn us out. The Dutch I under stand has a great trade and most of the people which live with them, could we protect them, would come and build under our fort. Here is not a lock to a dorre [ = door] or any else, I desire if you have any to send two, if not I desire the armorer may macke them. John Cabess is verry desireous to have some blew perpetuanoe s, and if you have any I desire you will send what you can, as alsoe some sheets (if you think convenient). John Cabess says he will live and dye with us, but he hath been in the Dutch fort since this falling out and I bebeve the Dutch will spare noe cost to gett him of their side, soe that we had best make use of the opportunity we have , for he tells me him se)fe they have offerd him whatever he demands to tum us out. I find by him he is not disatisfied at nothing more than at our being so backward to bouild , that we may be able to protect him, which with my respects humbly thanking for placeing me here. 287. Edward Searle Commanda, 12 Feb. 1694/5 Yours of yesterdays date per the 11 hand canoe I have received with one garder [=girder] & twinty six jeyces [=joists) peices, and will make the best use of the workman you have sent as I can till you can spare more. We are in want of lime, which I desire may be sent as soone as canoe returnes, for the briklayers tell me that the old morter which is here will be of noe service , however it shall be used in the midle of the wall. Thi s night came to an ancker in this roade an English interloper, John Samson Commander, from Londen. I shall be very carefull to learn what I can of the palavras of the countrey, and advise you upon all occasions. I desire sheets, knives, iron barrs, English carpets and powder if you can spare any as soon as the armourer has made the locks, & till then I cannot with safety secure anything. The people has been with me for their custome of settling a Chiefe, I told them that when I had goods they should have them and they are verry well contented, so desire to be advised what the custom is by next canoe. PS. There is a Brigantine from New England ladened with provisions &ca att an anchor about Axim . 288. Edward Searle Cornmenda, 13 Feb. 1694/5 I trouble you with this, being perfectly forced to it by the Cabbosheers of Commanda about their customs, who were ven-y insolent with me this morning about them and told me they alwaies used to be paid after a Chiefe came, their demands is to the vallue of 4 says & a halfe & two anchors liquors . My answer was that I was unacquainted with it, but to sati fie them I would send to you for goods, & as soon as 1 had them they should have their usuall customs. Above mentioned goods part of it is for the King & Fetera of Aguaffo. We are in want of boards for sea.folding and old [ones] for the same use. 289. Edwa rd Searle Comma.nda, 14 Feb. 1694/5 Yours of yesterdays date I have received with the perticulars therein mentioned . I am still in want of one say, for the[y] demand. a say for one Captain Newna more then what they told me of yesterday .41 Had I had goods here I would have given them twice as much rather then have had the trouble with them as I had this morning , besides the continuall charges I am & expect to be att till the fort is up. So soon as the canoe arrives I desire her loadened with bricks to ca1Ty up the comers of the wall with the boards, ladder and two walling hamers formerly desired. The Dutch has paniard Captain Abran and Shirnbee of the Mina about our settling here, which much troubles Taggee & John Cabess. 42 This morning came ashore the Gunner of Cormantine 43 to be their Gunner here, & their fort is extrodina.ry well man'd. What they intend I know not, but I keep John Cabe s out of their way as much as I can, for if we loose him our intrest here is alJ lo t. I have continually messengers from Taggee pre sing me to send for workman, for he says the Dutch will never leave till they see us so well fortified that they cannot pretend to drive us out, & John Cabess says it has cost him above ISO bendis. If you please to send for the bricklayers that are alt Dicl<ies Cove and Jct me have a few more slaves, this would goe briskly on till you can spare the rest. 290. Edward Searle Commanda, 16 Peb. 1694/5 Yours of yesterdays date I rece ived with the bricks sent per the great canoe, by her I have returned all the empty casks you sent the lime in. It will be impossible for us to be supplyed with lyme, bricks, and all other necessaryes in canoes. If you please to order Capt. Piles up loaded with shells, will macke us a good stock of lyme, and either load him up with bricks or send men hither that can burn us a kill. John Cabess and the rest of the people is verry desireous to have Harrythe Bomboy, because he was here and knowes where to gett stone & everything without breaking their fetiches. We are in want of boards for scafoldi ng & twenty joyce peices. The joyce of the roome is laid and two flanckers, & the garder is ready for the other, only stayes for joyce. We cannot shift without more slaves, & I desire to know what agreement I shall make with the people to bring stone, which I suppose you have mentioned in the agreement with the king of Aguaffo. Alsoe I desire a short ladder which Basjohn [= Bastian] says is ready made & purposely for the place, & ropes. Yesterday came to anchor here two Dutch Company ships, one from the Mina & the other from Shuma.44 They are hall'd in vcrry near the shore, which made John Cabess in a very great rage. I could not keep him from going to the Dutch fort to tell the Cheife if any men came ashore he would kill'd them, which he did under the walls att 10 a cloack att night, though I told him they might shoot him if he [ms. 'be'] ventu red in that manner. The Chiefe told him the ships should ride here four dayes, in this manner the Dutch did when they panyard the Commenda people before,45 & the Blacks are afraid that the Dutch now expect some people, either Quiferas or others, downc upon them to serve them so againc, but certainly they have some designe more then ordinary, which I hope they will neaver bring to pass, but I plainly see that wee shall neaver be att quiet nor free from expence till we are able to defend ourselves, & then f doubt not but here will be a trade to answer the charge. I desire a piece of lead to putt to the bricklayer s plume [=p lumb] rules, and the joyce & the necessaryes desired a Munday. PS. Basjohn tells me that either of the black carpenters will give him more assistance than this old man. 291. Edward Searle Commenda, 17 Feb. 1694/5 Yours I have just now received, & have send your boy to the king. This beleive the Dutch expect, & wee must expect if we do not go on further in our work to be beaten out. I will engage, if you pleasse to send all the worckrnen you have and good store of slaves & necessaryes , in twenty days to defend our elves against all the Blacks the Dutch can raise, and it is hard if we cannot raise friends to keep them of o long. The King of Agua:ffo had just end hi Che46 to call his men together, & we hear that the Quiferas is lickewise expected, but J am. certain we cannot be long protected if we do not protect ourselves, so humbly desire that so soon a this comes to your hands that you will do a de ire. PS. I desire good planck to macke a gate & 3 veny st[r)ong hinges for the door, with hooks, bars & staples , & provi ions & men, & we will not soe easily be driven as they may expect. 292. Edward Searle Commenda, 18 Feb. 1694/5 This comes as from John Cabes purposely for Captain Amo , and if he be not well a trusty friend in his roome this night without fayle , and he will endeavour to spoile the Dutch designes, and if we can now prevent Lhem, and you answer my yesterdays request, they may do their utmost afterwards . I desire as many black soldiers as you can raise with ammunition [ms. 'annurn:ition') for them. I have noe powder , what is here is in the hands of John Cabess, and he tells me there is two banels . As soon as I can I will secure the powder roome, and then will have itt from him. The Dutch designes is veny disperate [= desperate] , for this morning the Copeman told John Cabess that before the ships sailed they would have Taggees head, and if he [ = Cabess] would be their friends , they would pay him all expence. PS. If you have not great canoes to bring slaves, tradesman & all pray sent [=send] 2 hands [i.e. 2 hand canoes], that there may be nee delayes. 293. Edward Searle Commenda, 18 Feb. 1694/5 Your messanger is just come from the king of Agua:ffo, he says he expect the Quiferas & Cabestera people in 8 days to fight him.47 His request is that you will send him ten bendyes in powder and thirty bendyes in goods to carry on the warr, and that with all the speed as i possible that we raise the fort. I am afraid the Dutch expect them much sooner, and beleive they will stick at nothing to gett us out. His me senger goe in the canoe. The great canoe is just anived & I have received the things sent by her. Here is hoocks & hinges &ca enough, but none fitt for the gate of a fort, but for slight dores, therfo re l desire three larg[e] hinges, 3 ditto hoockes for wooden barrs. You advise you are in hopes the Quifera s will doe us no harme, but you may be assured that they will be with the Comroenda people sudenly and that the King of Commenda is not able to resist them, as far as I can learne, so that if they come we must rely upon their mercyes, for we cannot pretend to defend our selves in the condition we are in. If I had the worckmen I would strike all these houses & lay in the fort, & run up a spur for the present with swish and stone, & when we are secure strike it againe & bring the guns in to the fort and plant them out at the lower window, so that with John Cabesses people & our owne we may defend ourselves, if we should have occasion. I doubt not if I had all the workmen but in twenty dayes to have two flankers upp. I can if I have slaves gett wood, or I can hire free people to fetch it. The slaves I have will not keep these men I have at worck, soe pray let me have more men slaves. You give me noe orders what I shall doe about the free people bringing stone, therefore can make noe palavera with them. Here is noe timber fitt for joyce, and not joyce enough for the upper floor, so desire you will have joyce sawed for us. Basjohn says there is two peices of timber by the water side is fitt for nothing else, and if you will send sawers & a saw I will saw what timbers here is, except three for the top, and will not be enough by at least thi1ty peices. I humbly desire that if any possibility of spareing the worckman that you will send them, & I hope an wil l be to your content. If not I fear that when the enemy approaches that John Cabess will shift for him selfe , for he told me yesterday that if I was not here he would go to some other country, and asked me if the English had but one canoe. I satisfied him the other was at Winneybah . He replyed that he had allmost spent what he had about the palavera, and at last must be forced to seek for protection. I promised him as fare [=fair] as I can, & tell him you will supply us with necessaryes as soon as possible. Here is but one crow, we should have four or six at least, and more mawls for the breaking stone. The canoe I returned as soon as she was unloaded, hoping to have her tomorrow with lyme, and when Capt. Piles comes I hope shall have his loading with shells & some bricks if he can take them in. Crows and mawls are much wanted. PS. The bar for the gate four foot two inches. I have heard nothing of the workmen from Dickie s Cove. 294. Edward Searle Commenda, 18 Feb. 1694/5 This comes expressly to advise you that between this & Thursday the Quiferas will ce1tanly fight. We are in noe manner able to defend our selves, nor can I think of any protection here if Taggee be beaten . John Cabess came & advised me to send for canoes to fetc h away our things . I desire Mr Salmon may be ordered to take care of what I sent downe. I will alwais give him account, and send them by little & a little, that it shall be perceived as little as can be. We proce[e]d in our worck, but if Taggee be beaten, which is expected by all, it is to noe purpose, soe if the great canoe be not come away with the worck.men I leave it to yourselves, and desire you will order what I shall do and what security I shall take to save what I can of the Company timber &ca here, which I fear will be hard if once we have lost the feild. I desire your immediate answer. PS. If you send me ammunition &ca & your orders what I shall doe in the matter, nothing shall be wanted in me. 295. Edward Searle Commenda, 20 Feb. 1694/5 Yours of yesterdays date I have received, and all the whitemen & slaves sent, and observe its contents, but the bussiness will be of a sudden. The Generali of the Mine is like the rest of his countr-y men for fair promises & a false hart, but I hope to secure the Company possession against thern.48 If Taggee be beaten, indeed I know not what shift we shall make for water, which will be the chiefe thing we shall want. We have but 3 musquets, noe small shott, but little match, noe granadies [ = granadoes], which I desire with speed. Here is wood enough to be had to burn shells, but I desire lyme as fast as you can in the mean time. You write me I may keep the canoes, but they are not to be so commanded. I desire you will not pay one of the small canoes a era era, but besides make some of them an example, for it is a shame we should be serv'd so by them as follows. Last night I ordered them all to stay till the morning & the great canoe to take in John Cabesses women & begone in the night, & they stayed till day. I went to the water side myselfe, all the small canoes tooke in Comenda women before my face & one would not take a wife of John Cabesses, nor staye for a letter of mine, so you may judge if we are served so by our owne people what those will do for us that lives under the Dutch. They would take in nothing for me nor come ney [= nigh] the factory, and if any mis[c]hance happens I know not how I shall give you advise. We desire that what canoes you send you will order them to bring the canoes of[f] our side. I cannot get a canoe to carry this same, forced to send it after the great canoe. I understand Mr Bloome goes home.49 I am willing to stay here to see the ground of the designe & secure the place till the danger is past if possible, but if it be true I hope you will not dispose of Accra, but favour me with it.50 I have not been so ill these two yeares as I was last night, and all day yesterday, or I would have write you by the smith. At present am something better; pray pardon my fowle [ = foul] writing at this present. 296. Edward Searle Commenda, 21 Feb. 1694/5 Yours of yesterdays date I have received , with the particulars therein mentioned . We shall mount two guns today on one flancker & tomorrow the other two on another, to defend ourselves whilst we raise the other worck. The king of the Danckers, throw [= through] intrest Abon has made with him, thre[a]tens the Quiferas , which will delay them from coming so soon as the Dutch expect them, & the Quiferas has sent toe Taggee for elleaven bendis to drinck, which he has sent to macke a palavera, in which tyme I hope we shall be of more defence. If I hear the palavera is not to be made upp shall desire a canoe loade of water, pray let there be cask ready to be filled, for here is noe shift to be made for any here if we should be shutt upp. We have used almost all our boards to secure these flanckers & the gate, so desire what more you can spare, wee cannot doe any thing with less than fifty. Pray Jett Capt. Piles take in what bricks he can to bring with the shells. If the canoe can bring any bricks with the boards pray let her, for they will be wanting . Wee want three walling hammers & two trowells. The seaven which have been here since we first took possession want their pay. I know not what their pay is or from what tyme they must be paid, & these which came last I know not what method to take to have them provided of, provision being verry scarce. These two days I have given them la a day to buy cankey, & soe I must doe till I receive your further orders, & that is veny short for working slaves in this place. Boards the surveyor say you have not enough to cover the fort when it is raised, therfore if you thinck convenient to send to Dickies Cove to have planck sawed would doe as well, & I hope we shall be soon ready for them . I shall forward it as much as is possible, & make as cheep agreement with the Commenda people to help me with stone as I can . PS. The iron barr is to long, soe have sent him to be cutt to the length of four foot & one inch from outside to outside, & the hoocks wilJ not bare [ = bear] the gate, desire three elleaven inches Jong. 25 lb shott is as nothing, considering we have noe lead to macke more. 297. Edward Searle Commenda, 23 Feb. 1694/5 Yours of yesterdays date with i[t]s particulars I have received. I shall sende the sawyers to Dickies Cove to saw planck. I desire a canoe of bricks. John Cabess desires twelve half barrills powder, & as many musquetl s or snaphances. If he doe not fight he will pay for the powder , and restore the annes. PS. John Cabess will not be contented without Harry the Bomboy. 298. Edward Searle Commenda, 23 Feb. 1694/5 The Dutch have sent for Ante Ashrevy 51 now they see [ms. ' oe'] the other wiU not an wer their desires so soon as they expected ,52 he is to pass Shuma Revier [= 1iver] this night. John Cabess rus people with more of Great Commenda people lay weight (=wait] for rum,and (we] are all in what readiness we can be in to receive h.im. I have given John Cabes 4 of those musquets till you send lus, & two barrills powder , so that you know how l am provided. I desire you will send his, as we may be furnished. The Dutch will neaver leave , therefore it will be convenient to have a canoe of water & a cask of bread more , wruch I humbly desire on ight hereof . We are somtrung of better defence then we was. We want ca[r]tooch boxes , flints and a worme for our armes. PS. I also de ire ould junck & cartridge paper, and if we had more white oldiers it would do well. 299. Edward Searle Commenda, 23 Feb. 1694/5 Trus comes by John Cabess desire, for what Black soldiers you can raise. Pray send an hour glas , as we may keep watch right. PS. Pray lett them be served with powder & ball, & then they will have catoock (= cartouch] boxes, for the halfe of the twe)fe that i here have none. If Blow desire they may come by Iand.53 300. Edward Searle Commenda , 24 Feb. 1694/5 Yours of yesterdays date with the perticular to be sent the king I have received, they shall be sent him thi night. I hope the Qujferas will not come downe at all, for the Dankara s has ent to Taggee &ca to end eighty bendyes and they will not lett the Qu.iferas come, so they will conclude to end them pawnes and when they have aju ted all palavera will pay them , this is what 1hear, but they tell me that Ashrevy wa at the Mine about six days since & has taken mony to come & tume u out, but he will not find it so easy as he may expect. Tomorrow we shall be of as good defence as we can be till we have raised tbe ftanckers to their height with good morter, & good & dry lodging in the fort, & then we must have the smallest guris you can gett , for the e will take our work downe. The Dutch is on some new designe. The Galley is gone directly to the Mine this day, you may have an eye there to ee if she doe not take Mina people to cau-y to Shuma to assi t Ante Ashrevy. 301. Edward Searle Commenda, 25 Feb. 1694/5 Yours of this date per the great canoe with the particu lers sent by her have received, except the hour glass. I desire she may be returned with bricks. PS. Wee are in want of the three walling hammers & two trowells formerly desi red. 302. Edward Searle Commenda, 27 Feb. 1694/5 I send this to desire you that since the great canoe is not come today that you will be pleased to load her [ms. 'hear') with lyme, as much as she can carry, & if you have any more great canoes that you will send them with lyme alsoe. What we have here will hardly keep the men at worck for this day, & the bricks will last some days longer. If you can supply us I hope to have a flancker up to its height the next weack and ready for four sma ll guns , which I hope you will have reade [=ready) to send by that tyme. The Dutch Generali last night sent money by the canoes to Shuma to be sent to the king of the Danckeras, that he might not hfoder the Quiferas coming down to tume the English out. PS. Pray lett the walling hamme rs & trowells be sent , as also 2 or 3 pair of line irons .54 303. Edward Searle Commenda, 28 Feb. 1694/5 About sunsett came the Windhowns long boate ashore here , as the Black says with armed men. John Cabess with his soldiers went downe to the water syde, and as the Blacks say the whiteman fired first, but there is two whitemen kill'd, one head they have cutt off as they tell me,55 so that you may expect we shall have some sudden bussiness here. To trust the Blacks is hard, here is no comand to be kept over the soldiers you sent, they do us more harm in the fort then good, therefore on sight hereof I desire white soldier s, not such as the last, please to send but such as will do service. Tis the Mine people we may expect so sudenly. Tomorrow I will send all my lumber on board the Galley, 56 that I may Jay in the fort. Lett me have your imediate order what to doe. PS. John Cabess [would) have the Black soldiers you sent to help him, he told me otherwise that he waild [ = would] go to Commenda. 304. Edward Searle Commenda, 1 March 1694/5 This accompanys the great canoe, which I send downe that with the other that they may immediately returne with lyme. Here is noe thought of burneing the shells here now, for this hinders all our worck. When I receive the Lyme I will returne Capt. Piles and one of the canoes, that she may put the shells ashore with you and returne with lyme & brick . The Windhown is hall'd in soe near that she may kill men of the shore with small arms , & the Galley is plying upp , she ha fired three shot1, one of which just over our fort, & the fort fired two shott, one in the see [ = sea] and one in the towne . They have burned their towne & I suppo e we shall in few hours see their designe. If we cannot defend our elves I doubt we shall be in a bad condition , and we are really but of poor defenc e, seaverall of our men ick & others I beleive that never fired a gunn in their lives. I have pulled downe all the house , so that now we lay all open to the dow [=dew] & raine. I desire a tent or something that may shulter [=shelter], or tarpollings [=tarpaulins] to cover the men, or we must all expect sickness, a chirurgeon will be necessary. The Windhown takes all canoes that passes. I hope before this tyme you have sent a good supply of bricks & men, & if the fort & ships doe not fire at us, I hope to deale well enough with the Mine Blacks if they come. You must not on any accompt Jett us lack lyme , for delay s will be very dangerous where the case is soe desperate . Wee expect assistance from Taggee but as yet the mes anger is not returned. Pray send at least 100 lb short, for these lead barr will the best [m . ' beast'] part be given away to the blacks . At tymes I have desired bandilears, wee have but three colJers in the fort. Worm for the great gunns we have not one, we are bare of match, if you have not Engli h pray send this country match . I have advised you what I can. If we canot defend our elves here is no way toe cape the enemy , therfore we mu t not want any necessaries. PS. The Cabbo sheers desire two carpetts & one sheet to make a fetish. John Cabess is bare of powder , I cannot supply him. I have neither wax or wafers, therfore desire some . The glass you send is good for nothing , therfore desire others; if noe sma ll ones, two hour glass will doe as well. 305. Edward Searle Commend(a] , 2 March 1694/5 Yours of ye terday s date I have received with the men sent per the great canoe . I was ending her aboard the Galley to fetch the hells ashore, but the shott flyes so thick that the canoe men will not goe, o have returned her, & ordered Capt. Piles to weigh & saile for Cabo Corso. The canoes I desire this night fuU of lyme & the necessaryes desired yesterday as they can come . We stand still for want of lyme, & then pray let the Galley come up with lyme & bricks & four small guns. The blacks began to fight the Dutch fort last night about 8 a cloack & plyed them verry thick till one of the morning . There is only rwo Blacks wounded , what damaged the fort has received I know not,57 but they have made seaveraJI attempts to put more men from on board this morning but are kept of by the Negroes. Their Galle y will be in the roade in an houre more, & then to be sure they will make some other attempt. Taggee has sent John Cabess a supply of men this morning, & I supose they will atack the fort in the evening. John Cabc ss had a barrell of powder of me yesterday, soe that I have but three barrells and he is still in want, as I wrote you yesterday. If supply[ed] with lyme this flancker will be up next weack. PS. The men you send up says the Laiute nant58 told them they need take nothing with them, that there was provisions enough. I thought the provisions had been to have served when we had been shut up, but as they have nothing to live on I have given them part & I desire the Galley may bring more, for here is not a cankey to be had. Commenda, 3 March 1694/5306. Edward Searle Yours of yesterdays date per the great canoe with what sent per her have received. We must stay for lyme, we always putt more swish than lyme, that you have now sent will only serve tomorrow. If we had lyme we should raise the fort verry fast. l sent downe one of the carpenters yesterday, & he tells me he doe not sec any timber fitting for the timbers of this flanckcrs when it is up. Al Annamaboe there is severall peices fitt for nothing else, and will doe our bussiness very well. The Dutch last night came ashore with all their boaths [= boats], and by force landed their men just against the fort; they leaped out of their boates and gott up the rocks at least thirty whiteman & three Blacks which swam befor e to show them the way, & just now came ashore & landed many casck of provisions at the same place, the Blacks continually fircing at them but had not the hart to advance to hinder it, the shott flying verry thick from the Castle and ships, and boats . One of our women slave goe ing down to fetch the lyme as they began to fire came a shot from the ships, broacke her crew all to peices in her hand . Scverall shott from the Castle & ships has flew'd directly over our fort. Here is now a fresh talk of Quifera s coming this weak, but I hope they will be frustrated. Pray Lett the canoes come both as soon as possible loaded with lyme, and Capt. Piles bring a good quantity , for the rains is at hand and here is not covering for the men. 1have given John Cabess one barrel! of powder you have now sent & keep the other two, so that I have five banells & Tcannot keep less. He is much disturbed to be so scarce of powder. He in the canoe send[s} a boy to desire two barrells more, which may be sent in the night per a 2 handed canoe. Just now is come advi se that Lhe Quiferas will fight Taggee suddenly . The blacks spend abundance of powder, & if they are not supplyed will be a means to make them fly. The 2 hand canoe I last sent you is not returned, I hear they are afraid to come , you sending your letter the other night per the great canoe, that if they come without a letter the Dutch will paniare them . They are my owne slaves , & I never send them but on such an occasion as the other night, when I canot get others , because I would have them to give you advice when there is nesessity . I desire you will have them found & send them away , for I shall get noe canoe here if anythings hapens . lf you find they are rogues & wants to run away , pray secure them. 307. Edward Searle Commenda, 4 March J694/5 This comes expre sly to advise you that the Quifera are certainly on their march . Taggee just now sent me word to be gone with all my people to Cabo Corso, for that be would goe out of his country the night , and he did not know what the Dutch would do , that they have hired the Quiferas to fight him , & the Anta people our Castle . Pray consider ofthj & order for the Galley immediately to come and say le to windward of the Dutch, and six Cabo Corso canoes aboard to carry & send orders, as the Dutch do, and Capt. Piles to follow the signe I shall give him, and I will defend the fort to the utmost minute. If you give your orders we shall have upwards of ixty people & have not water and provition s for above eight days at most. We must have at least 2 months provitions and water , or wee must expect to deliver our selves into the hands of the enemy . If we have not a supply this night, I fear tomorrow will be to late. If they engage you must send people downe the country to make them raise their camp, or we shall be in a verry bad case. Thirty granadoe shells is nothing , the Dutch spend more in one night, and we have noe spare arms. Blunderbusse s will be verry well, patereroes 59 will lickwise doe us a kindness, but am afraid your supply will be to late , for they are certainly now designed on us, and the fair stor[i]es the Dutch tell you is of noe effect , & I thin ck it willbe convenient to send another messanger to the Mina, for perhaps they will think to have revenge on us for the men they had killed by the egroes . They salley out and fight every hour. John Cabess I hear designes to leave me this night. PS. I wish I had another man in the roome of John Browne , a mutinous raskalJ, he strocke [ = struck] the Serjeant yesterday, and you are sensible what he wa s before, he may doe more harme theen good. 308. Edward Searle Commenda, 6 March 1694/5 Yours of the 4th & 5th instant by the great canoes with bricks & lyme I have received. John Cabe ss went from hence with all his people last night , & I received another messenger from the King to tell me to begone to Cabo Corso, and when he had fought the Quiferas he would send for me [ms. 'my' j againe. I bid the messenge r tell him that I wished him good success, but that I did not designe to leave the place, thincking it of defence against any bla[c]ks that should co me against it, and that the Dutch dare not do any thing themselves. I des ire the canoes may both be loaded this night to be here in the morning with lyme, and the flancker shall be upp in four days, and I hope the gunns are ready for us, which will disharten the blacks for coming against us, and disincourage the Dutch in their procedings. If we wam lyme we shall not have a dry place by the rains, and no man can live long to lay as we all doc at present, several! already taken sick. We canot goc on with our building ifl send downe the slaves, & I know not well what to doe with them here, whether we arc beseigcd or not, for here is nothing to be had for them to eate. The old slaves doth very well, but those which are Alampoes I fear I must be forced to send downc.60 I have advanced them one akey each to buy provitions, and paid the old slaves their four months pay, deducting 9ta each paid them by the scrjeant, & the Alampoes complains already, so that if you can [send] ten good men Cambo (=Gambol slaves or others I will send you them all downe. There have been four of them missing ever since yesterday morning, but the rest tells me that they are only gone to get provitions. If they are runn away I believe shall have them againe, but they canot shift here unless they have come. I shaJl take care not to fire or molest any that doth not begin with us first, for if they keep us from water, as 1see by yours you have not sent any, we canot withstand above six days at most, & as for stom1ing us I fear them not. I shall be glad of Capt. Kecks company, 61 but fear he will not so well like his habitation. Pray supply me with lyme by canoes for this flancker, and by that time I hope it will be better, & if so will send downe the Galley for a whole kclme [= kilnl. PS. 1have sent downe twenty slaves, thirteen women and seven men. The Dutch sent to the watersyde & took a man of John Cabcsses that was wounded going downe in the great canoe. 309. Edward Searle Comrnenda, 7 March 1694/S Capt. Piles is now come to anchor in the roade. Tomorrow shall take ashore what you have sent except the powder, John Cabess and all the people being gone, soe that I have not any to supply. What I have is sufficient for the defence of the fort, & as much as our powder roome will hold. When I have occas ion will send for [ms 'fort'] it, or he shall bring it you againe. We live now as if we were in the woods, nobody comes ney us nor I hear nothing of the country palaveras. Here is I not a man or woman left or a canoe to send you a letter, if never soe great occasion. This is the canoe you sent to carry the men ashore you have sent to the Adoomes. 62 Cabo Corso canoes will be ve1Ty convenient to stay either aboard or ashore, for we shall not know of any thing the Dutch designe till it is come upon us. I should be verry glad to hear of the two canoemen I write you of the other day, who are stiU in the towne. 1 was in hopes to have had the canoes full of lyme this morning, what you sent was used yesterday & we have nothing today if we are not better supplyed. Men canot live here in the rains, if we are not molested before. Yesterday the Dutch toock a slave of the Companys out of our canoes, upon which I went to the water side my selfe & there J found a white sentinell & many blacks to overlook us, so I demanded his reason, and he told me it was his Copemans orders. I tould him he should not come nigh the canoes nor concerne himselfe with anything therein, if the Cheif had anything to say to me I would stay whilst he send to the Cheif, which he did and he came. So soone as his boy told him the slave was the Companys he turned him out of the Castle before him when he came. I asked him whither he had any order to molest me and paniare the Companys slaves, & that I had lost severall, one of which I found in his hands, and from him the rest would be expected , if they are not found elsewhere. Here is five still missing, & I beleive I shall never hear of them any more. He as good [as) told me him selfe that we should not live here long, and that what we lost we might write of it into England & there get satisfaction. Capt. Keck has given you his opinion of the fort, 63 and if you designe to hold it by force we must have Jyme to raise the worck out of hand.64 I hope Taggee will beate the Quiferas, that we might have John Cabes s here, for aftel' all the charges the Company have been at should verry unwillingly loose the possession. 310. Lawrance Keck Commanda, 7 March 1694/5 I this day about 12 of the clock came ashore here, & have according to your worshipps commands taken a view of the house & fortifycations , which according to the best of my judgement, I think not tenable, if a body or army of men appeare before it, for the reasons following, & first we have here indeed 4 gunns mounted, but in case of a storme we canot expect to discharge them above once before the enemy will be under them, for they are too big for the place where they stand, & your Worshipps I presume know verry well that great bodys file not ma[na]geable in small places . zdly [the) whole & best defence we can macke must be with our small armes, & whether a shot now & then made thro a loop hole, which may doubtless now & then occasion a man to fall, will be of force to putt a stop to their courages I know not, yet certain I am by the report I have here heard, if the Dutch had been able to make noe better resistance John Cabess had unavoidably been master of their fort,65 which to ours is a Fort RoyaU,66 for they may stand upon one anothers shoulders & leap into ours, there being not one floar !aide, noe not soe much as a place to lye drie in for the poor men. Th.is is plainly my opinion in the matter, & on the other side if we should kill them a great many men, as tis possible & probable we may, those that remaine alive must expect noe quarter or mercy, all which I humbly leave to your worships consideration, with this provise, that if your Worships will have it defended we will God willing defend it to the last, & sacrifice our lives in the service. 311. Edward Searle Comma nda, 8 March 1694/5 Yours of yesterdays date with a canoe loade[d] with lyme I bave received. I have this morning ordered the survejor to build the outside of the wall with good marter & fill the inside with all swish, lyme being so verry scarce. This morning passed by this pl ace to windward about forty canoes from the Mina, the Windhounds boate examined them all. Whither they were bound I know not. One came ashore to the Dutch Fort. John Cabesses man I advised you the Dutch took out of our canoe this night made his escape over the wall & came hither, be tells us that they expect [the] army verry speedily, and enquired mightily ofbim what was become of his master. 312. Edward Searle Commenda, 9 March 1694/5 Yours of yesterdays date with the Jyme by the 11 hand canoe have receive d. I hope two canoe loads more will raise this flancker. I am glad to hear John Cabess is retumeing, for I doubt the 300 soldiers they mention otherwise would never have been seen, if ever so great occasion should be of them. So soon as he arrive s I will dispatch the Galley to you for bricks . I hope the fort is not in much danger, but it is good to prepare for the worst, knowing what neighbours we have by us. I hope in few days to be some thing better secured than at present we are, I have gott wild cockernutt trees enough to cover the flancker, which will serve both for joyces & boards, and by Thursday I hope it will be finished. Lieut. Keck says there is two gunns on the redoubt 67 that wilJ be verry fitt for our purpose if you thinck convenient to send them by that Lyme, & if could have two more with them should be verry glad, these we have being too bigg for our worcks . I will with all the speed as can be secure another flancker & then we shall be in no danger of being stormed by the Negroes, & 1 hope by that tyme thee designe may be over. The Dutch hips still ride as they did. You advised me you sent twenty four Black soldier , here is but nineteen. If John Cabes come we shall be well enough guarded. 313. Edward Searle Comrnenda , 12 March 1694/5 Yours of yesterdays date per the 11 hand canoe loaded with lyme I have received. The Quiferas may promi e what they will, but they must doe as their master order them, & I am very sure that the Dutch has since I has been here offered to make up the palavera with John Cabess &ca & pay whatever they demand to turne us out, therefore there mu t be the same designe in bringing downe the Quiferas, and for Adoome A hrevy 68 I hear is lickewise bribed , and to my knowledge refused Taggee his assistance & have rather assisted the Quiferas. If guns that lately came over are to large for this place you may charge two at Annarnaboe, them being almost all small and wants larger, and then we shall have two on every flancker. The e we have here already with after fireing will bring downe aU our work. When another flancker is up we shall be as secure in our possession a we can be till there is a tanck. Water Capt. Piles says he has none for me. I designe to rai e another flancker before I make dry lodgings for the men, which I fear mu t be made without thack [=thatch) to fence till after the rains. If tho e palavers was but over that we could 'afely suffer thack in the fort. The two canoes you sent h.ither to me a Frida y I would have ent one to Dick:ies Cove to fetch the sawyers to saw the cokemutt trees, & neither of them would goe, soe that I was forced to gett a canoe that was ju st going of to Cabo Corso to goe to Dickies Cove, and a Sunday morning they went a fi hing, a they pretended to me, & have never seen them since, so I supose they are returned to your parts & I have not a canoe here. Capt. Piles if you order me in your next I will send downe for brick s & lyme , & I hope he may be here again before we are in any danger. PS. The black soldier are at me for mony , I know not what agreement you have made with them. I desire with the small guns shott, cartridge [ms. 'partridge '] baggs & cartridges fitting for them . 314. Edward Searle Commenda , 13 March 1694/5 Yours of yesterdays date with its conten[t] I have received. Anta Ashrevy I know is our enemy, but it is Adoome Ashrevy I say refused Taggee his assistance, but I beleive if Taggee has good success, we need not fear any thing but want of water . Capt. Piles I have sent downe, who I desire may b1ing bricks & lyme with the timber from Annamaboe for the next flancker. This is in a readiness to brick & tarras, therfore I desire that I may have 2 hogsheads tarras, & the remainder of her loading lyme, & the other all bricks, which I hope will keep the men employed till you send the Galley. I hope you will order a Doctor to send some medicines, here is two of the brick.layers tacken verry ill & one carpenter, the latter I have sent downe. The Dutch landed yesterday forty hogsheads water, & th.is day a great canoe loaded all with provisions, from the Mina. We spend all upon the provisions you sent, for here is nothing else for us. Here is nothing to be done with these Black soldiers, some have not been here above fiveteen days & they say they will be all gone if I doe not give la 6ta each. I should have a Cabbosheer here & then I could doe better with them than I can, for they thinck I keep the mony for myselfe, & they say you promised them that every new month they should have la 6ta each, and if not they will go to Cabo Corso, if I wilJ not lett them goe in the great canoe they will goe by land. Wee want some twyne for the gunner & bricklayers use, allso two or three spare axle trees for the guns that came this day. 315. Edward Searle Comrnenda, 15 March 1694/5 Yours of yesterdays date with what sent by the 11 hand canoe I have received. I am sorry that both canoes are not fitting to come as I may have Jyme and bri[c]ks. However, we goe on with another flanker in the mean tyme, and only the outside stones layed in morter, the other swish. I should be glad to have this flancker paved as we may mount the guns on it, which will be of great defence to us. The curtaine walls I raise all with stones because I would use as few bricks as possible, knowing the charge it is to sent them. The Black soldiers I will content as long as I can wi-thout any more mony, and when they ask me againe I will pay them according to your order. About two days since all the croornes about us were burnt, and we know not the meaning of it, but thought it to be the Dutch slaves, but this morning l understand that it was some out scouts from the Quiferas army. They will not macke any pretences on us till they have conquered Tagee, if they should it would too plainly show the Generall of the Minas false hart. I wish we may not be molested, if we are I doubt our case will be but bad, but I doe assure you I will not eassely loose possestion. A Cabusheer will be very convenient, if any body of men should apear, to send upon a palavera, for I must [ms. 'naust') not pretend to face out with them but keepe faire as long as possible & perswade them to our interest, if they are soe to be dealt with all, as to be sure if they conquer Taggee they will pretend the country to be theirs, & soe may say that none shall settle but those that make agrement with them . I wish Taggee may have success, & then need not make noe doubt of all this. I want trucks, & axle trees for the guns & twyne for lynes for the bricklayers & gunners use, & some thred to make cartridges. If you please to send another man in [the] Captains roome he will goe down tomorrow, but is not willing to goe till another comes. If you send none he desire the arms that is in his roome. PS. Here is noe cloath come for the Captain of the black soldjers. Since the sealing of this the slaves informe me that the bumboy sold the slaves missing, the truth of which I know not but have sent him downe by the canoe to prevent any further loss, & I desire two bomboys, one not being sufficient to take carre of soe many slaves. 316. Edward Searle Commanda, 19 March 1694/5 Yours of yesterdays date I have received. I know the Royall. Companye is not indepted to the Mina Blacks, nor did I ever hear that their canoes was so panjard by any, but it is licke a Dutch trick, 69 & I doubt not but you will easely come up with them. I presume that you beleive their designe is on us here, or they need not endeavour to put us backward in building. Indeed they have hindred us mightily, we have done noe work since Monday morning for want of lyme and bricks, and if we had been supplyed we might have had another flancker ready to floar [ = floor) by Saterday night , and then we might not have so much feare of the Negros. If I have never so great occasion canot send you a letter but when you send canoes, for here is none, which is very hard. I doubt not if the Quiferas overcomes Taggee but the GeneraU of the Mina will send white men to direct them to stonne us here, and if wee can defend ourselves we have not water for above five or six dayes. I hear that one of the great canoes is staved & Mr Jordan is missing, which I hope not true.70 I can ill spare the surveyor before the bussiness is over, which I hope will be tyme enough. As soon as I see how things are I wiU send him away to Jay out planck for us & cutt the axle trees lickwise. I have herewith sent seven musketts that are not servicable, I desire seven per next. The shott you send with the last gunns fitt only one, they are all too bigg for the others, the1fore desire by a two hand canoe 100smaller & some smaller patridge [=cartridge] baggs. PS. Leiut. Keck desires the arrnes in his roome whether you continue him here or not. 317. Edward Searle Commenda, 22 March 1694/5 Yours of the 19th & 21th instant I have received. By this canoe goes Basjohn. Capt. Piles arrived in this roade last night, I shall make the best I can of the lyme he has brought, which will serve the people to work about two days or three, you may be assured that none here shall stand idle whilst I can employ them about any things toward s the securei ng the Royall Company posseslion. Stone I have almost enough broake to build the fort. So soon as I heard the canoes were seiz' d on I had all the curtain walls run up with swish [to a] mans height to save us from small shott, which must come downe as you supply us with lyme. The Galley will be with you this day, in her goes Leiut. Keck. The fort is now almost as secure as it will [be] before the rains. I desire the shott wrote for in my last, & lines for the briklayers, with twyne for gunners use. PS. The bricklayer I send downe is indebted for provisions 12as 4ta, the carpenter 2.8. I desire may be stopt at pay day, & the rest for the mens pay send hither, for they are all indepted for provitions & mony lent, therfore desire that noeone may stop their mony or their [ = they] cannot subsist the next 2 months. 318. Charles Jordan Commenda, 22 March 1694/5 Yesterday I arrived here safe. The Mina canoes fish to windward of the Mina & keep together in great numbers, & 3 or 4 men in a canoe, and I beleive mostly armed. The cheif occasion of this is to thanck yow-worships for your favours, and also to assure you that J will in all matters be continually zealous & earful] in the Royall Company affairs, hoping also your Worships will thinck me so too. I begg your Worships as soon as palaver is made up with Mina people to send to me by first safe conveyance the five ounces for the things they penyard from me, and what else allowed for the abuse, which I humbly conceive ought to be considered, & not satisfied with less than a marcke, as I pretended I lost, besides other things. I desire creditt for a Guiney stuff, or a piece of perpetuano for a cloath for my boy Hansicoe, & that by first canoe sent hither, order Bomboy to send him to [me]. 319. Edward Searle Cornmenda, 25 March 1695 Haveing the opportunity per the messenger Tagge sent to the Sabo people, 71 who is now returned, I trouble you with this & for little else but to aquaint you that we are all in peace & quitniss as yett, but hear nothing of anything the armyes intends, nor cannot unless it comes from you, for here is none but our owne people. Our lyme will all be spent tomorrow. 1 desier the shott formerly desired & all the other necessarys. If we have water caske we can fille water here, such as it is, & if not should Taggee lose the feild, & the Quiferas come upon us, we shall find the want of it. 320. Edward Searle Commenda, 1 April 1695 Yours of this date have ju t received, with the particulers ent, and have sent downe the bricklayer. The shott are of the same sortes I received before , & are much to bigg for one of the guns, they will not enter the mus ell [=muzzle], so desire les . The musketts I received. I am glad Taggee is likely to gaine the victory, but wish they had ended the matter . The Dutch have sent to the Danckeras for assistance; the King of the Danckera s men was at the Mina a Thur day last, which I presume you may have heard. Our bread is short, and we can gett no cankey, nor any thing more then what you send. Wee have not ten days bread, & beaf but two casck, and peeze almost all spent, so that om provit:ions is butt short. If Taggee has the victory it is well, but if not we shall soon be in want. I desire on accompt of all the mens pay & [sic] money to pay them with. This canoe goes another with four of Taggees soldiers which came to me and requested a canoe . We have sent downe two of the Black oldjers that are canoe men with them, & desire they may be returned in the morning. Here is more of his people here, but had not a canoe to send them in. PS. Thomas Howard is Lndepted Sa 2[?] .ta 321. Edward Searle Commanda, 4 April 1695 Yours of the 2d instant I have ju t received. Basjohn brought noe to[o]ls hither , but 1have sent what can be spared, accompt of which is here inclosed. I hope by this tyme the Galley is returned with shells. PS. William Sessons being verry ill I have given him leave to goe downe by this canoe. He is indepted 4a ?.ta to provitions. Our match is the best part of it spent, I desire more of this contrey match to burn all night or we shall use abundance of Engli h, alsoe sheet lead to make two spouts for the flancker. 322. Edward Searle Commenda, 6 April 1695 Soe soone as I had wrote you my la t I was seized with a feavour, whjch held me for a considerable tyme and at thi present is verry violent upon me. Besides I find a hardness in my belly, and noe convenient place for a sick man to be in, nor any necessaryes to help my elfe withall, & nothing to drinck that i fitting for a feavour but muddy water , therfor e desire that you'l as soon a po ible send a canoe to bring me downe to Cabo Corso to stay there tell I am recovered , which I hope will not be long were I in a place convenient, & if I lay here being sick, I shall I am sure throw myselfe away, for its impossible for a sick man to sub.sist here. PS. I bumble desire a little of wine or bear [=beer] or anything fitting to drinck. 323. Howseley Freeman Commend.a, 9 April 1695 I retume you my most humb le service & harty thanck s for the many & contin ued favors I have received at your hands, and doe assuredly promise that I will act nothing in the station you have been pleased to place me in save what shall be to your Worships honour & creditt and the Royall Companys interest and advan.tage. I should here acquaint you with the particulers wanting to carry on the work of the Fort, as also about a supply of provitions, powder &ca, but shall referr you to Mr Searle, whom I discoursed about these thjngs this morning, att parting. 72 The Doctor, John Browne soldjer, surveyor and 2 Black carpenters went along with Mr Searle, I hope you will not long deta ine them , here being none left to carry on the worcks. All the soldiers are paid , except John Brittaine, who was left out of the bill , if he must be paid here pray advise what his pay is, & if any to be stop'd out of it. AU our man are in verry good health, but much pinch 'd for want of fresch provisions, and good liquors. 1 desire you would be pleased to [send] me up some brandy & rum & lymejuce, & let it come in the canoe that brings up the Doctor, least the canoeme n spoile it. Here is not a lock in the Ca stle nor any hasps for hanging locks, soe desire the same may be short ly sent up, expecially to secure the powder . Mr Jordan is verry much indisposed with the flux, so is desirous to have some thing sent up to give him dose, or else you would please to send for him to Cabo Corso. The black soldiers importunes me verry much for money & say that what you gave them at [ms. 'to') Cabo Corso was for a dashee. Mr Searle has since given them a months pay, pray advise me herein, for l shall not supply them till I receive your orders. 324. Howse ley Freeman Command.a, 11 April 1695 By this ca noe comes John Brittain and Thomas Wilkinson , both violently afflicted with the flux, in so much that at present they are not able to doe any duty, the latter of whom 2 nights since was bitt in the neck by a snacke [= snake), which in 4 hours tyme did cause such extrodinary pain, besides a great swelling, that we all cuncluded it would either have kill'd the fellow or made him goe distracted. Brittain is indepted for provitions 9a 3ta, which I desire you will please to stop out of the next payment. This morning the briklayer s wrought up all the lyme, soe hope you wi ll supply us with more verry suddenly. I beleive another canoe full will finisch this flancker wee are about soe high as to the laying on the timbers, but further wee cannot goe on with it except the carpenters be returned to gett the wood in readines s. I doubt not but if we are we! supplyed with lyme & bricks to have two flanckers finished before the rains. There is noe want of stones ready broake & part of the slaves are daily employed that way. Pray send up two soldjers in place of these men, and by all means the Doctor with medicines. The men are much afflicted with the grips and flux, which I supose is cheifly occasioned by the badness of the water. Yesterday about 4 of the cloak Mr Pinck and Mr Jordan went from hence for Dickies Cove.73 325. Howsley Freeman Commenda, 13 April 1695 Yours with all the necessaryes by the 11 hand canoe I have received verry safe, except the lyme, which is verry much damaged by the salt water, so desire you will please to lett the next shells Capt. Piles brings us be burnt here. What lyme you have ready burnt pray send with all expedition, for one canoe full serves not above 3 days. The Arda slaves are verry much necessit[at]ed for provitions in so much that some of them are fallen sick and others verry weack, scarce able to do any worck. Here is not come or any s01t of food to be had for money, so that if they are not supplyed from Cabo Corso with com or yams they will be in a miserable condition verry shortly. This is but a sickly place at present, so hope you will not lett us want medicines and one skilfull to apply them, here being none that can lett blood if never upon so great occasion. Here is great need of water cask, there being but 6 in the fort, which would not conta ine water enough to serve us 5 clays if besieged. If you please to furnish us with 18 or 20 hogsheads empty, we can gett them fill' d here, but the carpenter must order them better then the others he hath sent, else the water will all be spoyl'd with the beef pi[c]kle. I desire you to send me per next canoe a stone jarr to keep water in, if you do not use that on the battlements it will fitt my purpose. As for the European provisions I shall not be att all lavish of them, but the soldjers have nothing else to live upon, so that had need be well supplyed with all sorts. I desire to be enformed what powder, rum & palme oyle is allowed monthly for the use of the fort. Att this time there is much powder used both by the whitemen and blacks in clearing their armes once or twice a weak, soe that I hope you will pleased during these troublesome tymes to allow something extrodinary on accompt of the powder. According to order have sent downe the Black carpente r Alampo, whom we shall want as well as the rest in a ven-y short tyme. They must be sure to bring all such toolls along with them as will be used for cutting and squaring of tymber and about the carpenters work. Pray hasten the locks and lett the smjth make 6 hasps of severall sizes . PS. Yesterday the Gunner was seized with a violent feavour, and is verry desireous to be sent for Cabo Corsoe. 326. Howlsey Freeman Commenda, 16 April 1695 By this canoe comes the Black carpenter Alampo, who unknown to me stayd behind the 11 hand canoe, for what reason I know not, but after she was out a league att sea he came in to the fort, and told me the canoe men would not stay till he had fetch'd his chest or what else he wanted from his house, this is the only excuse he made for his neglect. This day we have to finish the flancker we are about, to the laying of the tymber s, which shall be done tomoITow or next day. The lyme you last sent will be all wrought up today, and except wee are supplyed twice or 3 tymes a weak the men cannot go on with their worck as may be expected. When you send upp the lyme pray supply us with a canoe of bricks. I desire you to send up some sheet lead for making spouts for the flanckers, also a baITell of taIT for the gunns, 2 brushes & 2 powder horns with primeing irons. 74 On Sunday last some of our Black soldiers together with the Bomboy & most of our men slaves, unknown to me, rambled upp towards the Adoom country to fetch come, who when they had gott their bootey, was sett upon by a party of the Adooms, well armed, who kill'd one of the Black soldiers and cutt of his head, and for ought I can imagine have either kill'd or panjard five of the Royall Companys slaves which are yett missing. I had given your Worships an accornpt of this action yesterday, but that I was in hopes before this tyme some or aU of the slaves might have been returned. I will not here trouble you any more about this matter , because the bearer hereof is come pmposely to give you a relation of the whole bussiness. I wish you would be pleased to send up another bomboy in roome of this, for he more hinders then forwards the slaves in their worck. If the Serjeant or my selfe was not constantly amongst them in the tyme of their worck, I beleive one halfe of them would be idle all the day. Besides I do [ms. 'due' ] impute the loss of these slaves wholey to his negligence, for had he not forc'd them to goe with him, not one of them durst have sturr'd from their houses . 1 hear nothing as yet of any ships to windward. 327. Howsley Freeman Commenda, 23 April 1695 The bearer hereof Se1jant Wilson being verry desirous to goe to Cabo Corso for 2 or 3 days, have given him leave, with whom comes Isaac Ogbourn, haveing for severall days been violently afflicted with a feavour. 1 desire you will please to send up another in his room, here being but few men in the fort att this tyme. Six days agoe we lay' d the tymber upon the flanckers, but since that tyme not a stone lay'd for want of lyme. Could we be but well supply'd with bricks & lyme, I am sure the whole building might be finished in 5 months tyme, which if otherwayes the rains will destroy, all our men haveing nothing to shelter them from the weather. I hope you will dispatch Capt. Piles hither with aU the shells he bring from Accra. Since my la t fo[u]r of the slaves are return' d, but ne of them as the other relate wa panyard and carryed up into th country . If you doe not send corne & yams to releive tho e here verry suddenly they will all be disabled from doing any worck, and severall of them dye out of meere neces ity. Here is not a graine or come or any fisch to be bought , that if it were not for palme berrys & such trash as the poor slaves pick amongst the bushes they would all of them er now have been quite famished. Pray advise me what pay the black soldjer have per months, this morning they came to me for their money & demanded la 6ta each man. Mr Searle told me when he went from hence that in J4 days their pay would become due to them, which tyme was expired yesterday. The necessarys you send up are come safe to hand, but not halfe lead enough to make tbe spouts. I have sent per the Serjeant a small case containing 6.gallon , which I desire you will please to send per bearer with brandy, and an anchor of l.ymjuce, a also the particuleers under written. [PS] I referr you to Serjeant Willson, who will give you an [ms. 'on '] accompt what provitions are wanting. Nece sary wanting: beds, comes [? = coines] & trucks for all the gunns,75 6 hasps for doors, . m [= 1,000] 4d nail , Y2m 2d ditto , 2 smaJI gimbletts, 3 pung[e] taffs, rammer heads, 6 worms for the great guns. To be mended: 3 musquett s, 1 larg[e] saw , 5 wedge s, I mawle. Cape Coast Tom went from hence last night. 328. Howseley Freeman Commenda, 1 May 1695 Yours received , together with one cask beefe & one of flower, but the case of brandy a the canoe men enforme me Captain Peter would not suffer them to bring now. I hope the letter I sent yesterday to Mr Ronan is received, 76 by which you will understand what necessity we are [ms. 'were '] in at this tyme, & expecially for bread. As for the flower it will be of little or noe use to me except I had palme wyne, which at this tyme is not to be purchased. If I have not ome come sent up I cannot pos ibly subsist, therfore earnestly entreat you to supply me with 2 or 3 chests in a day or two at furthe t, for all my fowles dye for want of meat77 to give them. What necessarys are wanting towards carrying on the fort, I advised you of in my former letters, so referr you to them , only desire we may be suply'd áo soon a possible you can, el e the rain will verry much damage the flanker wee are now a building. There is a great want of bricks as Jyme, therfore desire both may be sent together. Seve n of our Arda men slaves run away last Sunday, & are not yet returned or heard of, & I am much afraid of the rest unless some recruits are sent them. I writ in my last about the black soldjers pay, but haveing noe answer could not putt them off any longer, so paid them this morning la 6ta each man. 3 days agoe they had all run away from me, but I sent a file of musquetteers downe to the water side & fetch in to the fort 3 canoes which they designed should have carryed them to Cabo Corso. Pray faile not to supply me with the necessarys above said, & when you send me the brandy let the key of the case come with it, & a smal l anchor of lymejuce, for I have not any left. By this canoe come[s] Robert Ogleby , soldier, who has been so ill this 5 or 6 days that I t[h]ought he would have dy'd distracted with the violent feavour [which] was upon him, & here is not one can Jett blood though never so great necessity. Last night & the morning came hither near 60 soldiers, 78who intend to remain here till John Cabess come to them.PS. Here are now but a few man in the Fort, so desire you to dispatch the Serjeant & wha t men you can spare. 329. Howsely Freeman Comme nda , 4 May 1695 On Tuesday in the afternoon came hither John Cabes s, accompanyed with a great nwJ1ber of Blacks , and intends to remaine here till the retume of this canoe, aftenvards will goe for a few days to Abbraboe. 79 He desires you will please to give him creditt for 5 pieces of stript sattins, & lett them all be according to the inclosed pattern & sent up by the bearer, who comes purposely for them. All the Dutch canoes that have pass'd along since he came hither, his people have panjard, & yesterday morning came 2 Mina canoes from windward, both loaden with palme wine . from Diclcies Cove, there was in. a.JI 19 anchors, all which was brought ashore, though the Dutch fired att least 20 small arms shotted at the canoemen as they brought them in, yet hurt never a man. All our tradesmen lye idle for wan t of lyme & bricks, soe desi.re you wil1 send up canoes, that we may goe on with the worck. The last 2 days rain did noe small damage to the flancker they are now carrying up, & which was finished all but the battlements before Mr Searle went away, now letts in water in 3 or 4 severall places, but I suppose it may easily be stopp'd when the lyme comes upp. We hear nothing of the seven slaves that are run away. 330. Howseley Freeman Commenda, 7 May 1695 Yours have received, but much doubt Mr Pincks returne from Dicl<ies Cove before the tyme you advise the Dutch ships will sayle, so intend on Thur day morning to hire a 2 hand canoe & come for Cabo Corso. Yesterday in the afternoon. John Cabess went from hence, and as I am since enformed is gone to macke a palaver with the Adoomes, who have received &protected severall of the Quiferas women. I [ms. 'It'] suppose it will be a fortnight or more before he returns to Commenda, though great number of people are daily comeing & begin to build, so that do not doubt in a short time we may have as good if not better trade then our neighbours. 331. Howsely Freeman Commenda, 18 May 1695 This serves only to acquaint you that at my arrivall at Comenda I mett with John Cabess, who has been retum'd since last Thursday , but what palavera he hath made I know nothing of it as yet. I told him of your intention about panyaring the Mina canoes, who readily embraced the motion, & says if he once receive your orders, not one shall escape him. 80 I have had great damage by the rains since I went to Cabo Corso, both in my cloaths &ca, which I had lodged in the flanker aheady finished. The water runs into it so verry much that if it be not suddenly stopped , wiU certain ly spoil all the floor over the powder roome. Here are a great throng of people already come to inhabit insomuch that they have built howses almost as low as the landing place. I beJive there are above 40 canoes already come, so that I hope we shall not want for fish, but come is as s[c]arce as ever [ms. 'over' ]. The 17 black soldiers have promised me to go for Cabo Corso this day, from whom I have received 4 mu quetts belonging to the Fort, which was lent them by myself. PS. There are 4 musquetts lost by the soldiers, which were delivered to them by Mr Searle & reckoned in the inventory. 332. Howseley Freeman Commenda , 21 May 1695 Just now I received your , & imediatly sent for John Cabes, whome I have made privy to your command . He assured me they hall be strictly observe' d and forthwith put in execution. In order tbereunto he de ires you to send him as many slaves irons as pos ibly you can, not haveing any to ecure those he panyars, several! of his prisoners of warre have lately made their escapes from him for want of such necessarys. As to building near the Dutch fort, he hath already made this [ms. 'theis'] palavara with the people, that whoever goes to erect a house on that side of the salt pond, the chief actor shall have his head cutt of, and the rest be made slaves without redemption, and that noe fisherman is to supply the Dutch Copeman or his people, upon paine of the licke penalty. Yesterday the tow n Cabbesheers came to demand their custome, which they say is a whole say & 6 gallons rnm. I have desired their forbe rance till rcan receive your ordres, which I desire may be by the first opportunity, for till they are sattisfied I shall have noe quitenesse. The [ = this] morning I sent up into the country along with some of John Cabcss men, 21 of our slaves, whome he had orderd to load with come, I haveing agred to pay him 3a per chest. Along with the bearer comes John Cabess boy, to whome he desires you to deliver one of the Company silver headed sticks, because at his return he intends to goe himself and make a pa lavaro with the Adorns to come down & trade, as also to send some sort of goods to take up [ms 'yp'] along with him. He left a cloth that you gave to him for a dashee, & now desires to have it sent by his boy. He further desires to know what you will be pleased to allow him here per month & what you have agreed to doe concerni ng the palavero he made with you about Mr Elwes, whome as he relates is indepted to him 11 bendys 1oz 7a of gold. 333. Howsley Freeman Commenda, 28 May 1695 Since Fryday last here has been such excessive raine that it has beat down one end of the house T lay in, so that now I am forced to lye under a shed in the Castle, nor can I secure my selve there from the weather except I have tarpawling to cover over the boards, which are so crack'd & shattered that not one in five of them but letts the water in upon me. I desire you will please to send one with all expedition 13 foote square, els not only my selfe but what necessarys I have will receive much damage thereby. Here are two Leys [= lies] over the powder roome, but neither of them must be remov' d for fear of spoiling the powder. When you send the tarpawling pray send up some chests of sheets, here haveing been several) traders since Satturday would have bought a great quantity if they could have been supplyed. The soldiers are verry importunate with me for their pay, & desire you will order it by the first conveyance. Since my last I have heard nothing more abou t the Mina palavera. Pray advise me how you rate a whole chests of sheets when sold together. PS. Here are slaves daily brought to be sold, so wish you to supply me with goods to purchase them. Sheets arc most desir'd. Commenda, J June 1695334. Howsley Freeman Havci ng the opportunity of this conveyance by Mr Jennings canoe, which came hither last night,81 though t fit to acquaint you that John Cabess went from hence towards the Adoomes yesterday morning, being call'd on by eaverall of Great Taggees people. Pray supply me with the necessarys I wrote for in my last by Tuesday or Wednesday att furthest, & advi e me what I shall do concerning buying of slaves, which daily come hither to be old. I have not iron to putt any in, so desire you to send up some by the canoe that brings upp the goods. 335. Howsley Freeman Cornmenda, 3 June 1695 Your of the Jst instant I received la t night, but the tarpawling was left at Cabo Corso. I de ire it may be sent by the bearer, as also 6 gallons brandy, 100 weight of sugar, a cask lyrnejuce , 1 gallon sweet oyle, 2 gallons vineager, & a cask mallagetta to give amongst the slaves which I am now about buying. If you will be pleased to furnish me with the large tarpawling I formerly wrott for I can secure a great quantity of goods in the shed. I now lye in one of the flankers, which I am now getting thatch'd for that purpose. I do not think it convenient at present to build any other house, but to lye in the shed till the storm be quite blowne over, o shall employ the slaves in getting of stone [&] fetching of swish. Pray send me up what slaves irons you can pare at pre áent, els I know not how to keep those I shall buy with afety. Come here is verry dear, the lowest price being 6a chest, but beleive I can procure so much from John Cabess and others as will. serve my purpose with good husbandry till there be new come. 336. Howsley Freeman Commenda , 7 June 1695 I desire you will be pleased to lett me know what money is due to the Royall Companys slaves, who now begin to done[= dun] me for their pay, & send me up one quarter cask rum, one ditto of palrne oyle , as also the slaves irons and roalJegetta I wrote for in my last. PS. Pray send up a halberd for the Serjeant. 337. Howsley Freeman Commenda, 8 June 1695 This morning came downe to me from the Quifero's country one of the king of Aguaffo's men , & Captain Arno's, with the following palaver, which they did desire me to give you an accompt of this night, vizt that the Generali of the Mina has already sent up to the Was aw's & Anta Ashrevy 50 bendys in gold, to hire them to come downe & fight Tagee & John Cabess , but those people not att all consenting to the Generalls proposalls, immediatly sent it [i.e. the gold] away to Taggee & would have him accepted of it, but he refuseing ordered them to return it, & bath since in the behalfe of the English agreed to give them 20 bendys, which he desires you will not fayle to send him up with all speed, either in gold or goods, which you please, carpett & boysadoes being only accepted [= excepted] against.82 Great Taggee, John Cabess &ca being now at a place call'd Dumpim,83 they desire you to send up per the bearer a couple of sheets to give the two messingers that brought downe the news, for a dashee. Pray dispatch the canoe tomoITowfor the 2 men are order' d to returne from hence on Munday, at furthest. Commenda, 12 June 1695338. Howsley Freeman Yours received, together with the slaves irons and cask palm oyle, which was not above 2/3 full. On Munday night John Cabess came hither & desires you will dispatch the canoe sent on accompt of Taggee['s] palaver with the Wassaws, his men remaining here on purpose to waite her retume. Ockamy, the Captain of Commenda, had lately his wife panyard in comeing from Cabo Corso by the Mina people and sold on board the Portuguez ship which was brought in thither last weak. He is inform'd she sayl'd from thence yesterday & is come to an anchor of Cabo Corso road. John Cabess in his behalfe desires you to gett her releas'd & sent hither per the bearer, & what charge you are at he will be sure to see defray'd. I should have enlarg'd but time will not permitt, it being verry late before the Captain of the Town came to me with the palaver. Commenda, 14June 1695339. Howsley Freeman On Wednesday night about 8 of the clock, arrived here Mr Jennings from Dickies Cove, but in such a distracted condition as I seldom or never see any, & ever since hath continued delirious.84 The hamock men which brought Mr Pinck I never see, since he went from hence, so conclude they went for Cabo Corso along with the soldiers. Earnest Week Gunner is verry weak with the flux,& for my owne part I have had a vio)ent feavor & ague this 3 days, & fear tis lickely to continue. Be pleased to send me up the great tarpawlin I formerly desired,for except I can secure myselfe better from the bad weather, l shall have great reason to dread a tedious fitt of sickness. My ague fitt is just now comeing upon me, so take leave. Commenda, 16 June 1695340. Howsley Freeman Yours I received, and have aquainted Ookamy, the Captain of the towne, with what you writt me concerning his wife, as a)soe Taggees people who still remains here expecting your answer. I paid the canoe hire but no canky monyto the men that brought downe Tageel's) palaver yesterday, and all last nightI was extreamly afflicted with the ague & especially the fcaver, which continued till this morning at 8 of the clock, o I was forc'd (though much against my will) to send up to the Dutsch fort for a black they have there to lett me blood , since which I have been much better, but have nothing to take whereby to give me ease. I have sent downe the Gunner by this canoe , who i grown ed so exceeding [ms. 'exceedrag '] weak that I belive he would have dyed had h stay'd here 3 days longer . There comes in company with rumJohn Dobson oldier, who came hither from Dickies Cove this morning in a verry weak and lame condition .85 I wish you would be pleased to send some one hither that can both admini ter physick & Jett blood, else all must be great suffere[r]s if sicknes s happen , by reason we are at so great a distance from you. My hands tremble o much that I am scarce able to write , so take leave . 341. Howsley Freeman Commenda, 21 June 1695 According to your order I have ent downe all the brickayer s. Our slaves are verry urgent for their pay , being in want of money to buy prov itions . I would desire you to sent money , or an accompt what their pay come to, & I will pay them. I am still extreamly bad with the feavor and a verry great pain in my head , & so faint that I am not able to tur. I would desire your worship s to send me [a] little cord[ i]all waters, & some Venns treatle for two or three weats,86 & three or four doses of phissicke, by reason one of our men want a dose &ca. J would desire a quarter cask rum , & four cheeze if you have any good. 342. Howsley Freeman Commenda , 26 June 1695 Yours I received of Gamatan, 87 & according to order will advance the slaves each of them one angle. This morning about seven a clock John Cabes went to meet the Dutsch Copeman to palaver with them , as he use to doe several! times before, upon the sand by the Dutch Fort , John Cabbess haveing six men the Copeman ten, when after som[e] time being seated in their chairs and some discourse past, the Copeman haveing two pi tolls in his packett [=pocket], drew out one & fired at John Cabes s, which he perceiveing fell out of the chair upon the sand before the pi toll went off. The Copeman fired the other pistoll at him as he lay on the sand, but John Cabess grabling 88 about escapt the fury of them both, & by the a istance of his men gott clear. 89 The Copeman they say is wounded in the theigh with one of their swords, so went to his Fort & fired a great shott into the towne, & afterwards hang'd out their flagg, which is still flying, & I would desire you to send me two marque s of gold by the bearer Gamatan. John Cabess would desire you to send a party of soldiers if you can to remain here. I am still vcrry ill. 343. Howsley Freeman Commenda, 4 July 1695 Yours I received with lhe two marques of gold, & did acquaint John Cabess what mony he had had on accompt of his pawne, who [he] saith in a short time he will discharge. I would desire you to send an [ms. 'on'] accompt of the slaves pay , who are so inpatient that I cannot be at quiest for them. I am still verry ill, have ing a verry great pain in my head, that I cannot rest night or day, & desire you to send me something that might move it, & two blanketts, & a brass kettle. 344. How sley Freeman Commenda, 13 July 1695 I give you many thanks for sendeing Mr Julois up,90 & God be praised, 1 begin to be some thing better , tho verry weak, that J am not able to write to you, but I hope in a short time to gather strength. I received the two blankett s you sent by the boy , butt for the bra ss kettle I know nothing of. I would desire you to send the Whitemens pay, they haveing at pay day 4 month s due to them , & are in want of mony to buy corn or other nece ssarys , haveing no provitions for them in the Fort . As for the slaves they refuse to take la each, they will have their whole pay, therfore I would desire you to send the accompt & mony to pay them. The 11th instant we buryed Thooma s Heycock the carpenter. I would desire you to supply me with 4 gallons brandy more, & then not trouble you till a ship comes. 345. Hows ley Freeman Cornrnenda, 18 July 1695 On Satturday night last I sent my boy Gamata n to Cabo Corso along with Mr Juloi s, but since have not heard of him. If you have sent him away from thence he is certa inly panyard by the Mina people. Since Tuesday night our bomboy has been missing, I desire to know whether he be come to Cabo Corso. I had intended to have sent him downe as this night, for he was so horridly abusive to the slaves that they all came togither & told me, excpt I sent him away they would all go to Cabo Corso. He never would keep all to the Companys work, but wou ld dayly have par t of them to fetch his wood , to sell in the market for his owne use. I have at present put in one Coffee, a lusty young black fellow, one that speak s English verry well, and I beleive will behave himselfe civilly. Since my last rhave paid all the slave s Ia each, but the bomboy none. Pray if my boy is not come away send up the laves accompts, that they might be cleared to a day, for they are hard put to it to gett victualls , & the white mens pay, they being very much necessitated to gett provitions, everytheing here being att an unreasonable rate. I am now forc'd to pay 9 taccoes for 5 little boys , & glad that I can gett them for mony. Pray end a skeain of Englisch match & 6 balls [ms. 'ballt ' ] of country ditto, there is not an inch of English match in the Fort but what is on the linstocks ,91 alsoe 2 or 3 dosen of hoops ready made upp of 2 or 3 sizes to put in the powder barrels. The powder room is so extraordinary damp that itt rots everything that is putt in itt. We are forc ' d once a weacke to carry the powder upon the flanckers to dry, but now wee cannot stin a banell except they be new hoop'd. I have ordered the Gunner to take up a firkin tallow to make me some candles, which be pleased to place to my accompt. 346. Howsley Freeman Commenda, 23 July 1695 Yours I received together with the 2mk gold, which did not hold out to pay the men by 5oz 12a lta, as you will see by the inclosed bill. The slaves are daily at me about their pay, & say that the la paid them is all they have had for 5 months. The Se1jeant says he believe it is full so long time since Mr Searle paid them . I wisch you would be pleased to Jett me know what remains the due to them, for I am afraid if they are not paid, they will mo t of them run away. If the bomboy is not come to Cabo Corso I cannot imagine where he should go, ex[c]ept to the Dutch, for I have had the bushes all here about sought for him twice. The match & hoops you mentioned in your last the canoe men says was never delivered to them. At pay day I put in John Story [as] gunner, who [I] desire to know if you aprove of him & will allow him his usuall pay & match mony from this pay day, he doth promise to be ven-y carefull in his employ. Be pleased to send up the goods together with their prices as under written. PS. I baile carpetts, 20 oz corrall, 20 iron ban-s, I bale green perpetuanoes, 50 l lb pewter ba on , 1 bale white blankets. 347. Howsley Freeman ComJnenda, 7 Aug. 1695 I received yours this morning, & imediatly sent for the slave and a guide, and send him away. I gave the slaves lta each and the guide 2a to buy them cankey. The guide demanded how much I would give him for hi pains, but that I told himhe would know at Cabo Corso, o that if you pay him be pleased to let me know, or order me what I hall give him. PS. Slaves ent to Cabo Corso: Quan, Affodue, men; Quack, Quo, Yow, boys. Commenda, 15 Aug. 1695348. Howsley Freeman This is answer to yours of the 27th last month, when I received Mr Searlel's) old accompts & your aprobalion of John Story being Gunner. There is not a neater men in the Companys service for cleanseing of small arms, it being formerly his trade, but except he be allowed match mony he will not act, & I am sure besides himself here is none capable. According to your order have sent an accompt of the expence of powder. It is verry hard upon me to give an accom pts of every particulier cartridge of powder given out as such a time as when I first came, and the warr just ended, when I could not be att quiett for fresh comers for powder, as you will see per the bill. Had l denied all (though abundance went without) I am sure to have been reputed a verry ill man, & I believe it would not [at] that junctu re have been for the Companys interest or reputation to have been pinching of a barrell of powder. As to the expence of lyquors I am sure I come veJTylittle short of what charge the Company are at out of my own pockett, and yet have not given half the satisfaction I expected. Yours of the 13 instant have received, & can assure you there is nothing of trnth in the palaver brought you about the serjeant and bomboy. T'is so far from any thing of that nature that my man has been this 3 dayes with Taggee & John Cabess on purpose to gett them to send downe to the Captain of the towne (who is a great rogue) to lett our whiternen be supplyed with fish. This is the second time I have been forced to send to John Cabess, the first time one of Taggees near relations, & did so because the Cabbosheers and fishermen that [w)as on assurance they would not play the rogue with the whitemcn but Jett them have what fish they wanted, he caused severall of them to lick the dust of the soles of his feet three times apeice with their tongues. I sent for the Captain of the towne as soon as received your letter & asked him the reason why he sent such a lying story to Cabo Corso, his answer was because I had sent to Taggee. We are verry hard put to it for want of provitions, some time 3 days together & no fish. I formerly writt for 3 or 4 dozen of hoopp for the powder barrells, which are now so decayed that we cannot t0uch them but they will fall in pieces. Pray send me some paper, for this is the verry last sheet. I have a great sweUen [=swe lling] fallen into both my leggs, that Jam scarce able to stand, & such a great paine all over my limbs that I have very much adoe to write. r did expect to have seen the great canoe long since. 349. Howsley Freeman Commenda, 18 Aug. 1695 Yours received, and have inclosed returned your letter, which pray send me back againe by my boy when you have entered it. I have aquainted the Gunner with what you writt, who now is willing to embrnce the employ upon your first proposal!. The come is come safe, 7 basquetts, which measured only 2 chests & one basket over & not a graine more. The hoopes my boy brought are good for nothing, bei11gknokt of from old barrells, that they will not abeide driveing, pray lett the cooper send soome green ones that may doe service . I earnestJy entreat you now to Jett John Tygar, and another if you can spare him, be forthwith sent up. Wee have not men to doe duty here, being two of the e five that are here sicke of feavors & ague. If possible send up the great canoe up this next weeke with goods desire[d] . 350. Howsley Freeman Commenda , 23 Aug. 1695 Yours with John Tygar have received , and retume you many thanks for ending him up. Some few hoops the cooper have sent but we cannot make use of them . He hath only splitt the sticks, not fitted them to any size. He should work them up, els we know not what to doe with them. 351. Howsely Freeman Commenda , 7 Sept. 1695 Yours with the goods have received . The blanketts & carpetts took some wett , but it proving indifferent fair weather this afternoon have open' d the bailes to dry them . The corra1l so soon as I received it from the canoemen, the paper being broake, caUed the serjeant to see it weighed , and it wanted in weight loz 12a. Here had lately been ome traders enquiring for the nicconnees and blew bafts, if you have any pray send some up by next canoe. I have by the great canoe sent downe 24 musquetts which are alltogether u eles . Thomas Lee may cleanse and mend them, and if you please they may be kept at Cape Coast, we haveing here 22 more than what are constant ly used by the soldiers, besides no one man is able to keep so many in good order. There where at my comeing 59, but the Cape Coast soldiers lost 4, & the night John Cabess had like to have been .kill'd by the Dutch Copeman 92 the Towne Cabbosheers bo1TOwed [word illegible], one of which they have lost, so of what remains in the fort hang'd up, the soldiers arms in use, those lost & 24 sent downe make up the number 59. The sticks the cooper sent up for the powder barrells are of no manner of use, they being only cast asunder, if he do not fitt up some, & send by the canoe of 2 or 3 sizes, we hall have all the powder poy led for wan t of aire. 352. Howsley Freeman Commenda, 11 Sept. 1695 I have sent by my boy nine deale boards , which I desire you will plea e to lett Bastian gett sawn & bring them up the next week to make doers for the hou e. He must bring up ome small hooks & hinges to hang them, her are some in the Fort but they will be to bigg for such slende r works . I pray advi e me per next what you sell the lead barrs for, as also the iron bans , because I can sell some of the latter. The inclosed is the soldiers bill, which if you think fit to pay this day will verry acceptable to them, here being nothing to be had without the ready penny, and at unreasonable rate. 353. Howsley Freeman Commenda , 18 Sept. 1695 Yours received, and shall returne Bastian & Tyger according to order. When the slitt deals came up in the great canoe, 3 half deals were left behind, which I desire you wouJd please to order by my boy, as also 200 2d & 200 4d nails, 2 small hanging locks, 12 small hinges for the windowes & hooks proportionab le, here being none of either so1t but what are too big to put upon slit deals, la knifes for my own use. The Cabbosheers of this towne never let me rest but are daily duning me for their custome, pray let me know what you please to doe with them. The custome M.r Searle paid them is in the accompt you sent me. Our owne slaves are not less troublesome, not haveing a era era to help themselves. By next great canoe be pleased to send up some nicconees and blue [ms. 'flue'] bafts. 354. Howsley Freeman Commenda, 26 Sept. 1695 21stYours of the instant have received, & the next day acquainted the Cabbosheers of the towne with your answer, who seemed verry much disatisfied with it, but since I have not heard anything from them. The slaves are paid la per month for every month since I came hither, being 5 months beginning from the 29 March 1695, which was the first payement I made, to the 29 of the last month, and Sunday next there will be another pay day due to them. They say Mr Searle paid them only for 4 months each slaves, and that when he went away there was 2 months pay more due to them, for want of which they grumble extreamly. If you pl[e]ase it shall be paid them I will clear them next pay day. If some nails are not sent up Bastian cannot finish the wood work. For nailing on the hinges &a it may be easily done without him. I have got him to make me a desque [= desk) & want about 100 2d nails for the drawers, if any in the store pray send some by the boy. Here is but one axe in the Castle, which the other day cutting some timber broak, I have sent it to be mended and desire it may be returned by this canoe, for we cannot cutt any wood without it. Pray send up 2 sheeps skins, & some scupper nails, for we are in great want of them. PS. Here is a flying report amongst the blacks of 2 Eng lish ships being to windward, but what place I cannot be enformed. 355. Howsley Freeman Commenda, 30 Sept. 1695 I had sent Bastian to Cabo Corso last night according to order, but takeing phisick & it not operating save 2 times caused me to keep my [ms. 'me') roome and bed all day, not being able to set pen to paper. The goods all came safe, save one of the half pieces broad black bafts which is wanting & I beleive forgott in the packing, the serjeant & myself haveing counted them over 3 times. Six of the sayes are extreamly much damaged, some of them being eaten through all the folds. There is noe certain rate can be sett on them, so that if you please to have them returned or that I shall sell them for what I can get, be pleased to give me your answer per next canoe. As to the st.aves I shaU observe your last dirictions, & had done it before now had I been advi ed. I hope you wiU spare me Bastian again in a litlle time. What work I have done here might if he had not idled away his time been finished in 4 or 5 dayes. I humbly thank you for letting John Tyger remaine here. PS. Just now a Commenda canoe came from the Brandenburghs, haveing been there to buy a small canoe, who possitively affirms that there is a Dutch interl.oper lyes there who came out of Europe in company with 2 of our ships, & left them trading at Cestus. The interloper had been at the Brandenburgs since Satturday mornjng. 356. Howsley Freeman Commenda, 9 Oct. 1695 By this caanoe comes downe William Pigg soldier, who hath a long time been afflicted with a violent pain in his arme, which he saith was occasioned by a shott he formerly received, therefore be plea ed to send up another in his place, here being but a few to doe duty. We want the hinges, hoocks and nails for the window shutters. There has been such excessive rains here of late that it has done much damage to the house by beating in at the window . I wrote to you in my last about the damaged sayes, be pleased to give me order what I shall do with tl-iem, some of them are o eaten that I beleive if they where opened there is not a fathom off whole stuff in all the peice . PS. Pray send me ome inck and sealeing wax. 357. How ley Freeman Commenda , 15 Oct. 1695 I have herewith sent downe Serjeant Willson on purpose to bring me up some corn & what provition he can meet with all. I humbly begg of you to spare me what beef you can and send along with him. We here are so hard putt to it that I protest I never lived so in my life. I shall say no more, the Serjeant can well informe you. As yet we have not viewd the saies, but o oone as the Setjeant returns shall obey your order, and give you an accompt per next opportunity. The inck you send by my boy was lost, the cannoe being oversett. 358. Howlsey Freeman Commenda , 23 Oct. 1695 I am daily dunn'd by the Cabbosheers about their custome but have now at last prevailed with them to waite on you at Cabo Corso Castle. They alledge that Mr Elwes &a that have been here alwais paid it them, and they wounder now why shonld be so much lighted. This morning the Serjeant and Gunner according to your order have view' d the damaged saies, and do judge them to be worth no more the n what is mentioned in the inclosed ce rtificate. 359. Howsley Freeman Commenda, 29 Oct. 1695 Yours received, & humble thank you for your advise. I have not been at or neare the Dutch fo1t since I came hither but only the day Mr Searle went from hence. I shall take care to keep myseltf out of their clutches, & as for our men I have them given sufficient waming.93 I believe the Dutch Copeman had design to have panyard my Serjeant, for on Satturday last he sent his boy 2 times to me that he would give him leave to come & eat part of a pigg. Pray advise what must be done about paying our men. The next weake there is 4 months pay due to them, which coomes to as you will see by the inclosed paper. They are verry pressing for their money, & especially now it draws near Christmas. I have not taken above 7oz gold since I came hither, els would have paid them. All the blanketts are sold excepting 10 or 11, soe desire you will please to send up some per first great cannoe. I heare here that the Copeman at Sumah is run soe much in debt that he is like to be served as his brother Crajers. 94 The Dutch doctor was in our town 3 or 4 days agoe & told Serjeant Willson that the great ship brings over a new Generall, which news I wish may prove true.95 360. Howsley Freeman Comenda, 30 Oct. 1695 Haveing the opportunity of writing to you by this Comenda canoe bound for Cabo Corso, thought fit to acquaint you that this afternoon I panyard the Dutch Gunner belonging to their fort. I doe really believe though he promise not much it [sic], he is a verry ingenious fellow, haveing been Captai n of a ship as he says & born others comands. He will wel intforme you when you come to discourse him. Tomorrow I intend to send him for Cabo Corsoe. If I have done an ill action I heartily beg your pardon. 361. Howsley Freeman Comenda, l Nov. 1695 T have herewith sent downe the Dutch Gunner, who beleive will be verry servi.cable to you at Cabo Corso or elswhere. He is reputed to be a great artist in gunnery and one that understand fortifications very well. Notwithstanding I wrote in my last that I had panyared him, yet that was oniy done at the fellows request, to save him from the gallows, in case he should be retaken before he gott to Cabo Corso, but hj w[h]ole design of comeing hither was purposely to serve the Engli h, and he tol.d both me & Serjeant Wil Ison that he wa very much afraid they would fire at bim from their fort when they see rum come this way . He came to me early in the forenoon. The two marke of gold & goods I received safe , but there wants to make up their pay 6a 8ta, which I shall deposite at pay day. Be pleased to send me some quils and paper s, this being the last peice that I have by me . 362. Howsley Freeman Commenda, 30 ov. 1695 I understand by soome of our Dutch neighbour that the Galley is bound for EUiope shortly after Christmas ,96 I desire leave to take my passage in her for England . I am sorry that I am not in a condition of staying 3 years in the country. I am really reduced lo soe very weack a conrution that I am scarce able to rise out of my chaire without the helpe of my cha ire or some to assist me. I was never soe much indispo ed ince I came to Guinea. My long sickness J beleive hath [ms. 'thath'] thrown me into a con umption , for I have not enjoyed my perfect health since the beginning of June last, that now I am soe very much out of order whatever I eat or drinck generally makes me [ms. 'my ' ] sick. I hath sent to you sooner but defered writing in hope that I might recover my health & continue my station , but I find my self grow weaker and weaker. I hope the Royall Company nor yourselfs can take it anu se, since tis the want of health obliged me to leave the country , nothing els hould have done it. My [ms. 'me'] armes are so weak that writing is verry troublesome to me, I much fear los ing the use of them, soe hattily wisrung you all you[r] health & humble craveing your answer. 363. Howsley Freeman Commenda , 8 Dec . 1695 I return you my hearty thank s for you [r] kind letter , and doe humbly entreat the favour of you to send me up the 5 hand canoe tomorrow night that I ma[y] take my passage for Cabo Corso , where I hope the change of a[i]re together with the doctor assistance , I may a little recover my health before I goe of the Coa t. 364. Thoma s Willson 97 Commenda , 18 Dec . 1695 According to your order on seight of your letter I have sent the twenty four green perpetuano es. 365. Thomas Will son Commenda , 21 Jan. 1695/6 This morning by break of day we descried a fleet of canoes to windward at Aberebe,98 & some few canoes to leaward apadleing up to them, who as soon as they had joyned the fleet they bore directly downe for Commenda, being about 50 small canoes, 3 people in each canoe, two flags one Dutch on[e], the other a bloody flag, a red one. Our towne people were in no small confusion, bringing their wives, children, mats, basketts, pipkins 99 &a into the Castle yard, all scampering about in such a confused manner as if the enemy had been behind him a cutting their throats. In this hurly burly John Cabess came to mee and begged for Gods sake to give some powder, he have none to give his men , which I readily condescended . I encouradge John Cabess all I could, telling him if he could not hinder their landing, as I did imagin he could not, by reason of the Dutch Castle, 100 then to retreat to the Royall Company fort, and if they should dare to offer any insolence that we would stand by him as long as we are able. He promised he would, but notwithstanding all his promises hath it come to the test I beleive be & his people had taken to the bushes. It is pitty the fort is not better man'd, for fear of some such sudden exploit. The canoes came close almost to the shoar & there lay parle[y Jing from 6 a clock till tenn. There was 3 or 4 canoes came ashoar to the Dutch Castle, & so went to the fleet again. The true na1Tative of this bussiness I cannot learn, some say that Little Taggee was to fight Great Taggee, 101 & the Mine cannoes came to fig[h]t John Cabess & Comenda people , others say they heard John Cabess was gone into the country & that they came to fight Comenda, but hereing he was here were afraid to come ashoar, some say one thing & some another, but however I thought good to advise your Worships what I could. It is credibley reported that when this fleet joyn' d at Abrebee, besides the 50 that came downe to Comenda, there went thirty canoes to Shumah & landed. What their intention is we know not. A[t] tenn a clock these cannoes that lay at Comenda sett sayle & stood for the Mine. PS. The canoes I writt went for the Mine went but to Ampenny, 102 & are now come back againe. We haveing seen a shipp all this day off in the offing which we do imagine may be a Dutch ship comeing here, I hope your worsh ips will be plea sed to sent powder & men. This comes by one of the Companys slaves per land, by reason no canoe will goe, being about 2 a clock at noone [=in the afternoon]. 366. Thoma s Willson Commenda, 22 Jan. 1695/6 In my last I gave you an accompt of a fleet of the Mine cannoes, which went by land by one Companys slave names Breaney. The canoes are still lying here, some at Shumah, some at Comenda & others at Ampenny, ready to panyar any that shall make their escape by sea in case Little Taggee should prove victorious, which John Cabe s creclibly informed he is to fight Great Taggee on Sunday next, & so to come to Commenda & tume the English from thence, & that the king of Saboe i a sisting to him, John Cabess desiring you would be pleased to send for the king of Saboe, for without his aide Little Taggee can do nothing. 10 3 We are here in a verry ad posture of defence , haveing no victualls, the fishermen being all run into the country & the woman, & no caske to put water in, few men & the most sick, in a manner nothing, no orders what we must do in any case whatsoever. l would desire your Worship s to send us powder, men, water cask & provisions with your order as oon a á possible can be, which l hope will be tomorrow. PS. I have neither paper nor ink to write any more . 367. Thomas Willson Commenda, 23 Jan. 1695/6 Yours I recieved with the caske of water, one barrel I powder , tenn lead ban-s, and shall follow the contents of your letter to the utmost of my power. I have sent what carpetts I have left with the corral! . I have likewise sent some slaves as underwritten. We are beleagurad all about with Dutch cannoes to panyar who they can, as people ce1tain of victory . Most of our town people have desarted us to them selves. A I writ you word before , once more I hope your Worships will be pleased not to forgett us, but by all means to send u man, come & more armes, without which it will be impo sible for us to maintaine the Companys fort. Their is oo trusting to blacks, I can assure you these slaves I have will leave us if it comes to the pash [=push], for they gramble [=grumble] already, and say they want victualls. It would be incouragement likewise to the men jf youJ send a doctor. I am ay are more [=will say no more], but leave all to your Worships consideration. 368. Thoma Will on Commenda, 26 Jan. 1695/6 You mu t contrive som[e] way or other to gitt us of. John Cabess is gone and all the people. Whe [ = we] have noe come nor nothing to subsist on [ms. 'one']. They panyard the great canoe this morning and panyard all your canoes, and now the town people are gone. I doe suppo e we shall have the dam ' d people upon us, who I am afraid will give us no quarters, and their will be no way for us to make our escape. This morning John Cabess sent a . barreJJ powder to the King of Aguatfo with tenn lead bars. 369. Thomas Willson Commenda, 3 1 Jan. 1695/6 Yours I receive d at the camp, and according to order went with all speed back to Commenda, where we found William Reeves and Richard Braywood, whom whe left there, who by reason of their infirmities were not able to go, so did designe to gett them passage in a canoe the next morning , but could not by any mean s procure one, tho they proffered never so much, yet with notwithstandi ng their stay the blacks have stole allmost everything. Now you cannot be unsensable that we have no powder nor anything in the Castle, only a runlett I gott for [ = from] the king, for which I must pay him half a barre ll the first powder you send. For my part I have lost all I had. I wish the come hath come before the letter Coffee brought. The Company hath lost some goods. Coffee hath given you an accompt how we dispose of them, a further accompt you shall have when you send me ink and pape r. You may now supply with what you please, the seas being clear, the Dutch canoes being all gone. Pray doe not pay the canoes for I pay them here. 370 . Thomas Willson Commenda, 7 Feb. 1695/6 Yours I received of the 4th instant, with eight pieces of pork with [ = weight?] 32 lb & 90 lb of flower. The canoe men say he was plundered a little of the Mine, by a Shuma canoe bound thither , who opened the anchors, suspecting it to be powder, & took some peices of the porck away. Wee have daily expected aide from your worships either by sea or land but find none. I have often sent to you for men & powder, we haveing not above 40 lb in the fort. Here we live pend [=penned] up, kJ10wing nothing, niether intelligence from camp or court, and in daily expectation of the Miners or some other people to sett upon us, & when there will be no way for us to escape, & pray consider what a condition wee are in to fight, which wee must doe to the last. I hope you will be pleased to send up forthwith men, powder and match. The Dutch have a great many white & abundance of blacks alwaies in arms about their fort. Wee are all so lame with our late journey that wee are hardly able to stir. All our towns people are gone, some to one place & some to another; wee have not so much as any body to bring us any news, since the town people are gone. It is almost incredible to report the abundance of ratts we have, that wee cannot lye in our cotts a night but with sticks in our hands to kill them. 371. Thomas Willson Commenda, 13 Feb. 1695/6 On the 10th instant arrived here the Fauconberg, Capt. Browne, he came to an anchor in a great offin gunshott without [=o utside] the Dutch Gally. The 11th instant [he] went to send a few canoes ashoar, who were interposed by the Dutch canoes and so was forced to putt aboard againe, and so ever since then she hath layn without any action. 104 I wa very eager to know what orders he had for us, and working all the stratagims I could to perswade a canoe to goe of, which by fair words and great rewards I gotta canoe two nights together to putt of, but [it) was afraid aod so putt ashoar againe. The instant I gott a canoe that weot 12th aboard and came safe ashoar againe, in which I wrote for a barrell of powder, & the Captain sent me a barrell of powder, a little biskitt & 2 peices of beef with your letter. 105 As for the ship we know there was one att Cabo Corso, and their she might have stayed for any service she will doe us. He might have landed the first or second day if he would have man'd his boats, the Dutch thinking we had some force in our towne, but since the Dutch being of great strength, haveing about a hundred men in armes ransacking about our towne , & about 40 small canoes att sea, that it would be hard for us if the goods were landed to secure it in the fort , haveing no body in our towne to assist us. As for your six black soldiers [they] are a thing of nothing, for if they were ashoar they would not stay with u two minutes but would be scampered into the woods, and indeed what doe six signifie? I reckon in a day or two more they wiU not suffer us to fetch any water. If your worships had sent 10 or 12 white men & about 30 or 40 blacks, it had been ome incouragment, with a supply of powder & provitions, yett your worships may stand by us yett, only delays are dangerous. Send to the King of Aguaffo to send down 40 or 50 soldier , & the Captain of ship to man but one boat will scare all the Dutch canoes, that they will not come near him, for they are a parcell of cowardly dogg . This 12 instant came likewise here 140 Adoomes Shrevys [men], and went to the camp to aid Little Taggee. 106 And as for the slaves, I would send them aboard if I could, but cannot so much as gett 2 two hand canoes if I would give a mark of gold, and [how] I shall send this letter I know not. PS. Pray send possitive orders if I shall fire if they oppose our landing. 372. Thomas Willson Cornrnenda, 19 Feb. 1695/6 YoUIS I received last night with one cheese and a peice sowes beef, some bread, but as yett have not weighed it, but noe powder, I believe the King keeps that for the small runlett wee had of him, which when we opened was not . full, not above 20 lb, all which is to no purpose, it is men, men, men and powder that I for this two months together have writt for, but to noe effect, & told you the necessity & the desperatne of our condition, haveing not a man for ever[y) ilancker & most of them ick, as the other day when a turnadoe blew very hard and two canoes coming of from Capt Browne , 107 the Dutch General s fleet being ashoar dare not putt of, made all the force they could & came out of our side, thinking to have seized them ashoar, fired two or 3 small gunns att the fort, wee firing one great gunn & severall small armes made them retreat, our two malatoes Browood & Tyger standing trembling & would not fire a gunn at their countrey men if you would hang them. The people say you make sure of the Companys concernes as their goods & slaves &c, tho they signifie nothing to us, it is white soldiers & black solders wee want, they might as well have come by land as it was proposed for as to goe downe by land. The Dutch have store of whites & black, but what doe I say any more for when to no purpose? I am doubtfull this may prove a second Succondee [ms. 'Secuccondee'] bussiness, who have not one black hear to assist us. Om men wilJ come when it is to late. PS. You will receive ninteen slaves. I would have sent 20 but by reason they are gone into the bushes for potatoes. 373. Thomas Willson Commenda , 27 Feb. 1695/6 This morning all the Dutch canoes were gone for the Mine, the Coast now being clear. If they returne not agaioe you may now furnish us with what you please, by njght or I believe by day, for they have but one or two small canoes att the Dutch fort, provided they land not at the usuall landing place, but to windward. Wee are in great want of our pay; wee could now and then buy a taccoes worth of fish or petinoes 108 &c, tho att dear rate. Your worships must not be pleased to stop their pay by any meanes , being nothing to be had without the penny, and besides they are indebted to mee somthjng for the Companys goods, wee [have] four months pay each due. Wee want some musquetts, flints, small wier, small tackes, two or three small long gujmblets for clearing the vents of the great gunns, a skin or two to cover the spunge staves &c. Wee have a discourse here that the two Tagees are making up the pallaver, whether true or false I know not, wee haverng so many uncertaine reports. Wee received the provjsions from the camp, but rest according to your letter as you will find under written, but no powder. 76 lb bread 65 " beefe 30" cheese 374. Thomas Willson Commenda, 3 March 1695/6 Thi s by return of the canoe that brought the powder &c, all being received according to the contents of your letter excepting the come, which could not be two chests, being but four small basketts. The canoe men I believe play'd the rogue with it. I would not have paid them, but considering I should not gett a canoe another time and the come was very well accepted, being very scarce here, and none to be bought. The first come I received from your worships was divided amongst us all, the come I received from Capt. Browne I gave to the slaves, being then 27. The slaves begin to want their pay, telling me every day they are hungry. If you[r] worships would order us I would pay them, their being but eight of them and four months pay due to each &c, or send the money, with the whjte mens pay. I can advise your worships of no news. Here is great preparation for war, getting aJI the forces they can together. The Dutch spare for no cost, sending to all the people round about, but I think to little effect as I can hear, but I know not how I should hear of anything, for wee have nobody hardly comes near us, from on[e) place or other. The Dutch are very strong here, haveing a great many white men and black soldiers and a good fort. Wee on the contrary have but few white men, & not above ten old blacks, and four canoe men in the towne, & an open fort, which well mand [= manned] with water and provition enough would be sufficient. Your worships wi 11 consider and furnish us 4with men and some empty water cask, wee having but six punchings [ = puncheons] of water. Pray send by next opportunity, if no flints a flint stone, 3 or 4 lead bars, if wee should have occasion a bottle of sweet oyle for musketts, 109 one or two hour glasses, the ratts baveing broke ours, that wee have none to stand sentry by. 375. Thomas Willson Commenda, 10 March 1696 Yours received with the gold, wanting an angle of weight, but nothing else, and by the return of the canoe have sent downe the Companys three says and one blankett. As for the peice and 1/2of narrow bafts, I lett the men have it to make shirts, which [they) must [be] accomptable for. The says were all damaged and soe are these. The other night came a great parcel! of the Addoomes, wee could see them by the moonlight , but not to tell what quantity. Their horns played a pretty while at the Dutch fort, and so went for Little Taggees camp. Last Sunday wee heard in the night a great many small peice s goe off, as if they were but at a small distance. In the morning wee see about 12 or 14 blacks att a good distance as far as wee could see, which on a suddaine they all vanished into the bushes, soe wee see them no more that morning. I charged the blacks not to goe out of the towne, upon no accompt whatsoever. Notwithstanding one of them went to gett potatoes named Shadue, who I belive is panyard with some of the townes people, by Little Taggees [people], who sworme about here, there was this morning I believe, about 60 or 70 at the Dutch fort. The slaves will now be starv'd if you doe not forthwith send some corne, likewise wee have not provisions to serve us above 4 or 5 days longer . The seas are clear, here is only the Dutch Galley riding here, but they panyar no canoes, wee have one or two canoes goes a fishing every day, which goes of and comes in att the Dutch landing place, without any stop or hinderance. The come Mr Salmon sent last was so nasty nobody could eat it, but as hunger forc't &c. PS. This afternoon the Dutch galley [ went) to the Mine. If your worships would be pleased to send some beef & pease it would be very well, for it is cold weather and wee have a great deale of raine here &c. For the slaves I know not what they will doe. 376. Thomas Willson Commenda , 16 March 1695/6 Yours received with the cask of pease and 2 basketts of come (which is a poor medicine for seamen & slaves), it cannot serve above two days longer, wherefore you will doe well in sending more com and bread for the white men, for here is not a bite of anything to be had but what comes from your worships. It can never be that two little basketts, and them not full, can be a chest of com. Wee have that chest here, but should l measure it I am sure their would not be halfe a chest. Mr Salmons may be small, but never soe small. These canoe men have play'd the rogue with the slaves and townes people corn, they sold two basketts, one to the white men, the other in the towne. The towne canoe men says when they fetch com from Annamaboe , they have 3 basketts and halfe in a chest. Mr Salmon would doe well to send word how many basketts. I am advised that the Companys slaves is sold at Suma with two more of this towne by an old man that was panyard with them, who was likewise carried with them, but as he reports the Copeman, being in hast to goe to Succondee about some bussiness, bid them bring him another time, so he made his escape, but I rather think it was he being an old man and unfitt for bussiness the Copeman would not buy him, and so might make his escape, as they have served severall here that have been panyard, the Copeman seemed to be angry and chid them, saying who gave you orders to panyar these poor people, saying goe goe father or mother, such sort of inveagling deceitfull ways they use, when [they are] so old and decriped [=decre pit], with shakeing heads, unfitt for any service in the world, not worth a canky. He further relates of a two hand canoe that was bound for Dickies Cove, the Copeman of Succondee sent a canoe of & brought her in, which was fraigthted with two barrells of powder and twelve muskitts, they were carried to Swna, where your letter or letters were opened and read, and so for the Mine &c. I am glad to hear that Great Taggee is so strong. PS. Now the old man says they were sold at Adoomes Sherreys croome and that only he was carried to Suma as I writt before &c. Wee have heard a great many small arms fired towards the camp, both in the morning and the evening. 377. Thomas Willson Commenda, 19 March 1695/6 Yours received with the four chests of come. 378. Thoma Will on Commenda , 20 March 1695/6 This morning an six a clock wee heard them begin their fight, and about eight Little Taggee camp wee see on fire. Att four a clock came a great parceU of Great Taggees people, who brought in the joyfuJl tidings of Gr at Taggees victory, of which I was heartily glad_uo Here's abundance of them , and likewise their i a great many of them gone to the Dutch fort that fled from the camp , amongst which they say the Adoomes Shrevy and Captain Dick .111 The Accromes112 and Great Taggees people together are come to catch them if they can. The Dutch fort fires att all the blacks that comes to our fort. l am att great charge with them both with powder and Liquor. In hast. 379. Thomas Willson Commenda , 23 March 1695/6 This i by a canoe that John Cabess sends to buy him com, att his request to give you an accompt that this morning att eight a clock he came here , and doth intend to stay, would desire you to send him some beefe and brandy . I would desire your worship to send some more slaves to thatch the factors hou e & likewise the fort, for wee lie open to the air, nothing but the heaven for our canopy , wee haveing pulled all the thatch work downe for fear it should have been fired by our enemies, and now the raines are comeing on, wee have but seaven laves to doe the forts work. John Cabess would have you send him. a barreU of powder to give to his men. 380. Thoma Willson Coru.menda, 24 March 1695/6 This goe by returne of your canoe, by whom I received one chest, the other they4 keep their by rea on the sea nms so high they could not take it in. I hope your worships doe not pay the canoemen that come from me, for I have paid them all along here, but of that gave you a caution in two letters before. I can advise you but of very little how affaires goes. That day the fight was, as I write you before, here came about two hundr d of the Kings soldiers, when att the same time wee see from as far as Ampeny about a hundred black comeing upon the sands toward the Dutch fort, came very softly aJong, they were people that run from the camp for but very few had armes. Had the Kings soldiers came by the sea side they might have secured a great many of them, but they came out of the countrey hallowing and fireing as if they had been mad. There was not two minuite s difference in their coming. The Dutch blacks just gott to their fort, the Kings people all enquireing after Addoome Shen-ey in whom they were in pursuite. The poor people were very much tired with fighting and pursuing all that day. I gave them an anchor of Barbadoes rumm, and they beg soe heartily for powder, telling me they had none, and that they were going to Adoomes Sherreys croome, where there was a hundred gone before, that kept up along tbe countreys, that I was forc' t to give them some, soe they lay downe till eleven a clock att night, then went fo r Adoomes Sherreys croome , but I can here of noe great exploits they have done their, only burnt one or two little ajacent croomes, and brought away some come, that is some few of them that are come away, the rest remaine their still. His croome is on an island, 113 and that they cannot gett at itt without canoes, being very deep, so I suppose they may have belagured it. John Cabess as I wrote you before is come downe here, haveing about a hundred soldiers, few of them Commenda people, or his own, but most of them the Kings people , and Abonds [ = Abon ' s]. All things are seem ingly att quiet here, John Cabess according to his order, sending up and downe to adjacent croomes, willing the people to return to their habitations, and due [ = do] allegiance to their King, & that now since the King had conquered his enemies, they might enjoy what they had in peace and quietness. Whether they doe this out of policy to trappan [= trepan] 114 the people , or whether to wrong the fort of his people, 115 I am not able to judge, but certaine it is a great many of his people are revolted from him, and went to Little Taggee both from this towne and all the adjacent croomes, whome they all did hope would prove conqueror. Both battalions stood to it bravely, their fell that day a great many men, here is a great many men killd of Commenda that I know . The Dutch are now as mute as mutton , keeping all very close within their fort. PS. Pray send some paper for I have not a bitt. 381. Thomas Willson Cornmenda, 26 March 1696 Yesterday being the 25th instant I had an embassador from the Dutch fort, to tell me that the Copeman had these orders from the Generali, to tell me that they meant us no ill will or to doe us any hanne, but if the blacks would not lett their slaves fetch wood and water peaceably and quietly they had orders to burn the towne, and hop't wee would have nothing to doe with it, to which I answered wee had no ill will to them , nor nothing to say to them, but that the towne belonged to the English, but that mattered not , he had best follow his Generalls orders, I had nothing to say to them. So I dranck to the man in a dram, as being a white man, & soe was going from him. He still urged me that I would speake to the black s to lett their slaves goe and come in quiet, 1 told him wee had no pallaver neither with whites or blacks, and I had nothing to say in it, neither would it be prudent in me to meddle or make up , the people being exasperated against them , that .they were the King s people, strangers to mee, whom I had never seen in my life before, and that he had better redress [=ad dress] himself to John Cabess. Why, says the man, is he here? I told him yes . He askt me that over three times, if he was here, I told him yes, & bid my boy call him, then the man began to be afraid and would have been gone, I bid him stay and told him nobody should hm1 him here, as he came with a message to me he should return safe to his fort. John Cabess came not himself, but sent a Cabosheer that came downe along with him from the King, to whom the man said he had nothing to say to him, but that he came with a messige from his master to the English serjeant, [and] withal! rehearsetb the story he told mee. When the Cabbosheer heard him talk of burning the towne he was in such a rage that he could not utter himself at present, but spiteing [ = spitting] on the ground with derision, and said what and all we here, lett him come. He told the man all this ground was Abba Taggees, 116 and that the Dutch had nothing to do with it, and how they dare be soe impudent to ask them for water, when they had raised a warr against them, and would have cutt them off, so bid him stay, and he went out to John Cabess, so when he came in againe, be asked him what made them sue for water when they were so strong that they threatned to burn the towne, but however told him they mattered not a little water, they might send their slaves and fetch it, but that a great many of their men was in the bushes, and if they were panyard they must not blame him for it, so with this answer the man wen[t], and bad the satisfaction of seeing John Cabess as he went out of the gate, who sat under a pallavering house, to whom the man pulled of his hatt and bowed very low. The Copeman sent two canoes away to the Mine within halfe an hour, I suppose to tell the Generall his answer, and that John Cabess was here, but however I have seen no slaves fetch water. The Copeman when he sent the bold message little thought we were so strong, or that John Cabess was here. His embassador would have eat his words, saying the Copeman only bid him say so but did not intend to doe it. The meaning of my writing to [your] worships is to have your possitive orders, should they attempt any such thing, which I am pretty well assured they dare not. They are afraid before they are hurt, J see nobody that opposeth them, but all still and quiet. PS. Pray send me some paper & inck. 382. Thomas Willson Commenda, 28 March 1696 This by a canoe that was coming to Cabo Corso about some bussiness, may acquaint you I received yours of the 26 & 27 instant, the former with the halfe barren of powder, a case of spiritts, six peices of beef, John Cabess with his people being gone the night before to a croome hard by, to make some pallaver, and told me he would returne back on Sunday next, but ordered the aforesaid things to be sent to him, which was accordingly. The latter shall observe the contents, but received no rumrn. 383. Thomas Willson Commenda, 31 March 1696 Yesterday being the 30th instant about nine a clock in the morning came here from the Mine about 140 Adoomes going home to their countrey, they having a white flagg with them, they made a small stay at the Dutch fort, and so went their way. In their going they unfortunately litt upon the Royall Company's slaves, who were fetching wood, and have panyard three of them. Ther[e] was no thought that day of any danger, most of the towne went that morning to the ajacent croomes to fetch come. The Adoomes keep the exact path and went to Shamma. About an hour [later] John Cabess came. It was well they litt not of him, for he had not above twelve men with him. He saith if you will give him orders he will panyar some of the Dutch slaves. On Sunday next he doth intend to be with you at Cabo Corso. These Adoomes are a great plague to the King and John Cabess, haveing a great many of their women and will not Jett them goe. [gap in correspondence, April 1696 to March I 697) 117 384. John Rootsey Comenda, 6 April 1697 Yours of the 30th March last by the 7 hand canoa and 13 ditto loaden with come have received, also 30 countrey boards, one role sheet lead and brads by the Sally Rose. I hope to have the Swallow here suddenly, for the shells that came from on board the former will doe no more then build the outer walls of our tanck, which in two days designe to begin, if no raine comes. By the bearer Serjeant Thomas Willson have sent my accompts and ballance, being 6oz 13a 2ta era era gold for Annamaboe FactoryY 8 My suddaine remova!I from thence here, and the indisposition of my body, the care of the building, and the warr119 is the reason of my not sending them before, but I hope to be excu ed because I before sent you a ruff draught of them, which you returned to me, and ordered duplicates to be ent, which now comes by the bearer [ms. 'prier'}. I cannot conveniently draw out accompt for this place by reason know not the mens pay due to them (or each of them), but have supplyed them with money to serve their occations, tho have not called to a generall pay. I had last week ome Cuffra men down, whos[e) business was to take fetiche with John Cabes that no traders or their good should be panyard that came downe here (on mens heads that owed John Cabess money) , which after had passed on both sides, the Cufferas promised to be downe in fifteen days. John Cabess hath ent a man with him into the Cuffera countrey to take a fetich for him, which palJaver I now perceive is the reason I have sold but five perpetuanoes and a chest and a halfe of sheets of the goods you sent me, but now in all probabillity I shall have a vast trade, not only thence but from the Addoomes. Yesterday our cook, one of the five old slaves you ordered me to pay come to, i mising. He went for wood, a the other slaves tell me, whether he run away because be was not paid as the other are or (is] panyard, I cannot tell. I sent the Bombay and old slaves after him, also John Cabess soldier, who brought me word they trackd his foot teps over the salt pond towards the Dutch Fort. I then sent the Bomboy to know if he was there , and also to demand of him a child, which Little Taggees men had stole, and was in his custody, or he could procure , as he sent me word by his boy with his cane , but when the Bomboy came to the Castle gate he was stop'd (the like he never did before) and the Copeman sent me word that he had or knew of [n]either of them, and sent me word I should take what followed if I sent anybody to hi Fort againe. The reason I suppose [is] that three of his soldiers run away from his Fort, and perhaps mi tru t me that I intice them, but I hear they are gone to the Mine for want of food there. Shall want boards to turn the arch of the tanck, and 1000 20d, 10d & 6d nailes, some countrey match, wedges to break stone, and maules. 385. Paul Read Comenda , 6 April 1697 These with my mo t humble service pre ented to your worships, these are most humbly to desire the favour of your worships, as to Jett me know what wages I was paid on board Capt. Pepperell 120 and to what time, for certainly there i a very great mistake , which your wor hipps are not informed off, for on the 19 October 1696 I received an ounce of Mr Salmon , the 28 November at our comeing for Commenda [omission?], and since about Christmas another ounce sent me here to Commenda , and then at pay table Doctor Jackson received for me 3oz J2a l0ta, [ofJ which 6oz 12a l0ta the six angles one taccoe might be due to him [i.e. Salmon] for provitions, but I allways understood the money I received of Mr Salmon by your worshipps order had been part of my wages, but he has stop' d it from Doctor Jackson out of 3oz 12a 1Ota, soe I am certaine that is the mistake, which I suppose your worshipps did not know of, therefore I most humbl y desire your worshipps will be pleased to lett me have a right understanding , and I shall for ever as in duty bound pray for your worshi ps good success. PS. I suppose I was indebted on board about £3 English as Mr Adds laid out for us at Plimouth before our departure. my wages due when I came on shore the same day was £30 15s English of which I received no more then 4oz 12a lOta 386. John Rootsey Comenda, 18 April 1697 Yours by Capt. Pepperell with the oyster shells and bricks have received, and I shall want more of the latter and severall other necessaryes, which have sent Mr Gabb to acquaint you with. The man slave I mentioned i_n my last which run to the Dutch Fort they have returned againe on Friday last. I desire you'l please to enquire of Capt. Pepperell and he can give you an exact accomp t of the bigness of our tanck, which in my opinion is not to large. Those that infonned you I made it larger then the fort requires, should have consulted with me or had soe much reason to consider the illness of ground, which caused the hole to be made slopeiag and soe wide on the supersition [ = supposition ]. I could not send my accomp ts by Capt. Pepperell but you shall have them by first opportunity. I have not nor will see a farthing of Mr Phillips money, Mr Puppelett I suppose can give you an accompt of what gold was by him when he dyed. 121 PS. By this canoa comes Richard Hewett according to your order. 387. Paul Read Comenda, 2 May 1697 This comes to acquaint you that Mr Rootsey is soe dangerously ill that I am fearfull he will hardly recover. Please to send Doctor Jackson up with all speed, for here is none can help him, soe hope you will send him with all expedition, for I fear he will hardly find him alive. 388. Charles Nern, Paul Read & William Gabb Commenda, 2 May 1697 These comes to give you the sad news of the death of Mr Rootsey, who departed about one of the clock, but very senceab le to the last minute. He has disposed of what he has by will and hath inventoryed all he has before he dyed , and see hi money ealed up, soe have sent to advise you and hope you'! please to advise what may doe, and send some Chief to talce care of what is here, and wee shall take all the care we can to our utmost i_n the mean time . 389. Gerva Jackson Commenda, 5 May 1697 Here are at this place severall Dankara traders with money for goods. I have money for 16 perpetuanoes at lla each and they want good tallow, knives, iron barrs, & powder, John Cabbess say there are Dankaras comeing down to buy a large quantity of perpetuanoes . The old Dutch Copeman is sent to the Mine, and their bookholder is come Copeman. The urveyor wants the ironwork to break stone, and the Gunner some countrey match. Wee are all heartily glad to hear of our good success.122 John Cabess 's people keep the bushes night and day. 390. Gerard Gore Commenda, 10 May 1697 In pursuance to your orders of the 6 instant received into my pos session the Royall African Company of Englands fort and factory at Commenda with all the goods, merchandizes, gunns, stores, amurrition &c, as will appeare by the inclosed inventory , and with me by the SaUy Rose I received 100 blue perpetuanoes , and one cask knives mentioned to containe one hundred sixty six dozen. I desire you! be pleased to end me some tallow and some white blanketts, being enquired after here, and according to your order have sent Mr Gabb surveyor and two sawer s on board the Sally Rose, 123 tho shall mightily want him in two or three days, by which time the tanck will be firrished to arching, which then can goe no further without hi direction, I shall tand still for want of him, and that where he wa a geeing , he said be could mark out and direct them in all thing what shall be wanting and necessary, both for this place and Dickies Cove , in four or five days time , and that after his staying will be to no purpose and much to our hinderance here, and that in a day or twos time more wee must stand till , which will be much damage to what i begun, for wee can finish nothing without him, for he said if he found his raying would be to no purpose there, after he had given as much directions as needfull, would come here by canoa from thence, and that you'! please to end two or three barrells of tarris more , this being too small you have sent, will not near firrish it. PS. I desii-eyou will end me accompt of the customs of thi place, not knowing what it is, and al o desire the good above writte for may be good for encouragement of traders , here being a great talk of traders comeing speedily , and likewise the other inventory shall send by the first conveyance that offers. 391. Gerard Gore Commenda, 13 May 1697 Yours of the ll th instant by Doctor Jackson with the seven hand canoa I have received, also on accompt of the Royall African Company thirty white blankets damaged and 20 halfe firk.ins of talJow broaken, and some without firk.ins, and four quarter cask of rume containing one hundred gallons , and also two barrells of tarris, which will not be sufficient to finish the tanck, but desire you will send one cask or two more if possible, which believe will be little enough to finish [ms. 'finfish') it, but will make it goe as far as possible I can. I allso received by Capt. Piles 124 seven and a quarter chests come which in my last I omitted to advise off. The reason was he not sending it before he was under saile, and would not measure it, nor did not care how or what he gave, which came very wett on shore, and late at night, I had noe oppertunity next day of drying it, by reason of the weather. Likewise as concerning the surveyor as you was pleased to write to me, twas not my fault, for Capt. Piles came on shore himself, which I told him I could not send nor spare without your orders, which he told me he had possitively from you for to send him, which I told him I must see before I Jett him goe, which orders he told me had mislade and could not find them, and was mighty importunate for him and told me he wondered I should disobey your orders, tho' I must acknowledge it was my fault because I did not see them, but the Captain makeing such a great noise about him, I thinking it was so, and that I should disobey you if I did not send him, therefore I sent him, which I humbly begg your pardon in soe doeing, tho' hope I shall have no occation for him before he comes againe. I believe the tanck is not soe forward as you have been advised, but it will be this three days before it will be ready for arching, which I shall forward as much as possible I can, and all other things. The inclosed is a note of what carpenters tooles is wanting here, not havei.ng any such tooles here, which wee are at a great loss for, therefore desire they may be sent by first opportunity , also the iron work the surveyor gave orders for when he was at Cabo Corso last may be sent with them. ' PS. The above mentioned goods (vizt the blanketts) are soe much damaged will not sell here at the price you write, and also the tallow, therefore desire you will send me at what rates I shall dispose of them. I also desire you would be pleased to send by the next some powder for the Forts use, haveing here but 4 . barrells powder, as is by inventory, which will not be sufficient for this Fort, in case we should have occation. Also by the next I desire you will send five yards canvas. I have sent by Doctor Jackson according to your orders what the canoes could carry belonging to the deceased Mr Rootsey. a mortice chizell above one quarter breadth, one graveing ditto, one half inch ditto, one broad ditto, one inch ditto, a scribling [=sc ribing) gouge, one hatchet, a paire of hollows and rounds, one inch thick, one paire of three quarter, a small billeter [=pilaster] plaine, 8 smoothing plaine, a fine back saw, two small formers f= firmers], one 3 quarters the otber two ditto, a rivitting l= rivetting) hammar .125 Commenda , n.d.392. Gerard Gore I wrote you by Doctor Jackson of the 13 instanl, with whome I sent according to your orders what things the canoas could carry be longing to the deceased Mr Rootsey, which I hope you have received. Also what things I wrote for I hope you will be pleased to send as soon as possible, especially lhe tarris, for what we have here shall have worked up this day, tho' have been hindred somthing by these two last nights raines, and also the carpenters tooles I desire you'l please to send them , these they have here already not being fitt for their work. Also I desi re you wou ld be pleased to send me an accompt of every mans pay, and from what time due, and your orders for my paying them, and also an accompt of !he customes that is allowed for this place, which mightil y want, not haveing what it is. Comenda, 17 May 1697393. William Gabb According to your worshipps order have been at Cape Tres Pointas, with lwo sawyers from Cape Coast and the two sawyers 1 had here, and with much adoe gott six slaves at Dicl<ies Cove, Mr Vincent126 was not willing to Jett me have any, but with these I have cutt down six trees, which make near fifteen load of timber, at fifty feet per load, propper for what wee shall want hear or Cape Coast. I have cutt all.off in lenglh and squared six or seven load, and sunk a saw pitt and lined it out fitt for sawing, and gave direction s to the slaves to cutt it out in scantling,127 tilt lo be carried on board. I likewise told Capt. Piles what was best to be done with the timber and desired he would lett his carpenters mate or any one white man to see the slaves did what r ordered them aboul the timber , but he would not, and both the Captains 128 sware neither of their men should put a hand in order to getl dowoe the timber lo the sea side. Capt. Pepperell sayed he will carry but very little timber, and especially no heavy peices , he spoke of tarrying there two montbs. Capt Piles did intend to saile thence in eight or tenn dayes, but now he is vexed he must tarry for the other, and say none of his men shall help him. There is a great deale of as good timber as any upon the Coast, of two feet diamiter and downwards, but I doubt unless your worships send more slaves, and some white men to see the timber cut out according to orders, that the shipps will bring away but little, and there is enough cutt close to that which may be gott with little trouble. I have cutt the poles ordered by Capt. Piles. Capt. Pepperell desired me to acquaint your worshipps he expected a seven hand canoa, and if he have none cannot gett his wood on board his boat, for they ride at grapling 129 and cannot gett away att the Brandenburgh Castle. The slaves have no come, nor is there any to be bought in the countrey, else I had bought them some, for they cannot work without it. I came from thence a Fryday in the afternoon, it was late a Saterday night before I gott to Commenda, because of bad weather. Yesterday the raine hindred the canoa from goeing. Our masons have been to extravagant of their taITis in my absence, it is all gone and the tanck is not quite high enough to turne the arch, the bottom is not floored, therefore desire your worshipps would send downe three or four casks as soone as possible, that we may perfect it before the raines damage the walls too much. Our bricks prove very bad, they moulter away with the wett, and our masons have used parte I ordered for the arch. If a great canoa comes pray be pleased to send some well burnt. I will take care in all things committed to my charge. PS. If any goe to helpe cutt timber they will want 2 or 3 broad axes and two cross cutt saws, that all may work. Wee want the iron work I desired, especially to break stone. 394. Gerard Gore Commenda, 18 May 1697 Yours the 17 instant I have received, with one barrell of taITis and the carpenters tooles therein mentioned, also 3 maules and six wedges, with a list of every mans pay except'Anthony Martins, but the canvis and the iron work you writte me off I have not received, which I desire you will be pleased to send by the next, and also what things the surveyor wrote for the 17th instant, who there also advised you of what he had done to windward, and as for the tam s and what wee have here wee shall have used by this day night next, therefore desire you'! please to send as soon as possible two barrells more, which if wee have not cannot finish our tanck. 395. Gerard Gore Com.menda, 20 May 1697 Yours of the 18 instant by the seven hand canoa I have received, also one barren of tarris, which will not be sufficient for our tanck but shall want one more, which I desire you will please to send by first, and also what things you wrote roe the 17 instant by the two hand canoa, which I have not received. I am aJso sorry I should acquainte you of the mi fortune that has happened to the 7 hand canoa, which about nine of the clock yesterday morning arrived here, about which time the wind began to blow very fre h, and wa mightily troubled to send a canoa of to her, by rea on the sea wa oe very bad, which canoa in comeing a hare againe was broke all to peices, and as soon as I had received yours according to your order I endeavoured to send of the iron work that was left here by Capt Piles , but could not, the seas and wind being soe extraordinary bad nobody would venture, baveing soe bad an example before, and that the seaven hand canoa could not goe by reason of the weather , was forced to remove, and about 9 and 10 of the clock last night there came three of the canoamen on shore, which I sent for into the Ca tle, who said the canoa was broke all to peices by a thunderbolt , and all the rest of the men lost, and everything that was in her, and this morning makeing further enqui1y and searching after the goods but have not as yet found any, but have found five of the canoamen and the canoa a great way upon the sand near the Dutch landing place, and not i.nthe condition they aid she wa in, but has been broke in comeing a hore, and just now I have found the rest of the canoamen which they said wa lost. I have secured them all and examined very strictly, I have threatened them very severely, and I believe they have played the rogue with the goods they had in her, and I find them all in everall stories, and I hope shall make them confess omthing, for I find some likelyhood of it, but all as I can gett out of them they say they came ashore at the Dutch landing place, and before said to windward of our Castle , and that they believe the Dutch has the goods, whereupon I sent to see, but they own nothing of itt, but I hope to find it other ways, for two I have whip'd at the gunn but cannot make them confess anything to the purpo e, but hope hall by inflicting punishment on the rest, which by the next shall acquaint you more at large. In the mean time I write this to acquaint you how it is, that you may doe as you think convenient. PS. The surveyor sayes that one barrell more will not be enough, but desires wee may have two, and aJ o if a large canoa goes to Cape Tre Pointa for to send some well burned bricks in her for this place , he believing wee cannot finjsh the taock without them. 396. Gerard Gore Comenda , 20 May 1697 Yesterday 1 wrote you of the loss of the seven hand canoa, which I have examined in more stricktly, and in whiping the third man made him confess that four of the canoamen had carryed one ca e into the bushes a great way beyond the Dutch Fort when they went first with the canoa, but that roan said he was not one of the four, but he was one that looked after the canoa, which four men he told me, whereupon I examined [them], but could not make them confess anything to the purpo e, upon which I fastened two of them to the gunn, and began to whip them, but they would not confess what they had done with the goods, but they said they were beyond the Dutch Fort, but would not tell what they done with the goods, and believe the Dutch had them, but the Dutch would not own nothing, tho believe had some, for wee saw three slaves very busie upon the sands a great way beyond the Fort, tho' could not see what they brought with them, tho' I sett people to watch, and thjs canoaman that said there was a case carried away by the 4 canoamen, to find out the truth whether it was so or not, I made him show where he thought it might be laide, with whom I went myself above a mile beyond the Dutch Fort but found nothjng in the bushes as I expected, but wee found the boards of one case, which the surveyor said was broke open with hands, and the boards of another case, some way beyond, all scattered up and down upon the sands, and upon one of the rocks found one single nicconee , and this morning by break of day sent more slaves, with a whiteman with them, hopeing they might find more , by reason the water was down, but could find nothing, and examineing of two which I had whiped before, bringing them to the gunn the second time, who said if I would Jett them loose they could find some, which accordingly I did, and sent some slaves and the whiteman with them againe, who in one hours time brought me word they bad found a great many and wanted more slaves to bring them home, which I sent and one white man more to take an accompt how many there was, which in bringing them home , the Dutch Copeman panyar<l and carried them into his Castle, wrnch l sent to know his reason for itt, who said he did not know whether they were Dutch interlopers goods or not, which was all his reason, and in the afternoon I mett him halfe way between the Forts, but he was still in the same story, which I told him his argument was very weak in that respect, and that I gave him sufficient reason to the contrary of that, and made it known to him that they were English Cpmpanye s goods, which then he said he had orders from the Generali of the Mine to seize of all things that came near, anything that belonged to the English, tho' he and I have had a faire correspondence one with another, and that yesterday I sent to lett him know beforehand that they were our slaves that were comeing, and what business they went upon, and he sent word to me againe that any body that belonged to me should goe any whether [ = whjther] without bis medling with them, and [he] did not, but paid his respects to me both in comeing and goeing, and he beg' d my excuse because he did not give me invitation into his Castle comeing by, because it was ms Generalls orders, and as before mentioned, and in friendship to me he lett us doe what wee did , which he desires I would be secrett in, and as concerning the goods I told him I was sorry that he had done what he had done, for I told him he must be accomptable for everythjng that was in the canoa, for what slaves did not find he took from ours, which was, as the man I sent took an accompt of them, forty one whole niccooees in whole length and fifty seven peice s in severall lengths, and that the Dutch had this day a small canoa from the Mine, by whom he has sent to acquaint the Generali of what he has done, whose answer he shall have tomorrow; which when comes he will send me word what it is, which I de ire your order for my further proceedings , whet her wee shaU take them or not , or end for them if he send me word. 397. Gerard Gore Commenda , 25 May 1697 As I wrote you of the 20th and 21 á1 instant the next day the Dutch had a canoa from the Mine , who I believe had a severe check from the Generali for what he had done, for he has sent to me several! times to send for the good againe, and that he was mighty sorry for stopping them, who I sent word againe that I had sent to acquaint you of it, and that I could doe nothing before I had heard from you. Al o acquainting you that wee have used all the bricks, and have not finished the arch of our tanck, but want halfe a days work to finish it, and that wee mu t now stand still for want of bricks , which I desire you'! be pleased to send with alJ speed a great canoa loading about three thousand well burnt bricks, or more if the canoa can carry them, and here is above four thousand of what ha been sent not being halfe burnt are washed all to sand, which if had been good should have had noe occa ion for more. Al o desire you will send with the bricks two barrells of tanis, al o the iron work, powder and canvas formerly wrote for by the 13 instant. Al o acquainting you that cask of knives which I received by the Sally Rose, haveing occation to open for sail.e, find some much damaged with rust, and would not sell at 10 per a, tho ' have di po ed of a few at that price, and that if I would have old them at 12 per a believe might have sold them all, which if you approve desire you would send me word by the :fiJSt.Also acquainting you that here is severall white men very sick, especially my Serjeant and Gunner, who he very ick and weak. I myself have been very sick this 4 days, but thank God pretty well recovered , tho know not how long shall continue soe, therefore desire you will be pleased to order some m dicines by the first, our Doctor here haveing nothing to give us in our sickness, and that he tells me he has wrote to the Doctor several} times for what medicines he wants, therefore desire you would order Doctor Jackson to send some thing of what he wrote for , or what he thinks most needfull, our Doctor here not haveing over much knowledge in phisick, I believe. PS. Since my writing this some of our townes people being by the salt pond gathering musells of from the rocks, the Dutch fired a shott at them, which l sent to know what it was for, he told me it was his Generalls order that none hould come near hi landing place, as he said they were, that he knew them to be John Cabess people, and they were none of our Companyes slaves, if they had would not have fired, tho he told me it was his Generalls order to fire at aJI, which he told me at our fir t meeting, and desired I would not Jett our slaves come near the salt pond, which I told him againe they mus t be about their busines in digging stone, and that if he fired at them , he and I must fall out, and that he must lett no blacks out of his fort, which I believe has cast some terror upon him, for our slaves has been where they could not goe formerly, both digging stone and cutting wood, and that if he should fire at our slaves at any time, desire your orders whether I sha11 fire, if light of the same opportunity. 130 398. Gerard Gore Commenda, 26 May 1697 Yours of the 24 instant with two barrells tarri.s by the 2 hand canoa have received, which will be sufficient to finish our tanck, and as to the return of the goods pan yard by the Dutch Copeman, I wrote you of the 21 s' instant to know if I should receive them if he sent me such word, as [he] has severall times, as I wrote you yesterday. I have here according to your orders sent you an accompt of all the Royall Companys slaves that are here. Paul Read as I wrote you yesterday lyeing very sick and weak is not able to walk out of his roome, or else according to your orders should have sent him by this canoe, but if recovers if you approve of it I will send him, and as concerning the canoamen I am sorry that you have not approved of my punishment upon them , which was but on three, but bad I not took these methods, you would never heard of any of the goods, but they told me a parcell of lies, that there came a thunderbolt and split the canoa all to peices, and that three men were drowned with the canoa, and that they were almost halfe way to Shurna. This they told me thinking I would enquire no further into itt, and that I thought it was all truth they told me, and that accordingly it was plotted before what they should say, and their three canoamen that they said were lost were hidd, and could not be found for a great while, and that the first I whiped said the English did not use to whip canoamen for takeing care of their goods, and that it was done by thunder and they could not help it, but I saw to the contrary of that before I whiped any, by the canoa which was broken in comeing on shore, which in whi.ping the second and third men they all confessed the truth, and said they were goeing on shore at the Dutch landing place, which was not their business, for they might have been halfe way at Dickies Cove, or at least ways keep out to sea, then all the goods had been saved, but they had certaine]y a minde to play the rogue with the goods, as I believe they have with part of them, for one of the canoamen confessed soe, as I wrote you by the 21 instant. I have also with the enclosed sent you an accompt of the iron work we want, which the surveyor gave the fin.ish orders for when he was at Cabo Corso Castle last. The bricks yesterday wrote for desire wee may have with all speed, wee standing still for want of them. PS. I have returned by this canoa 2 iron crows broak, 6 ditto wedges 3 ditto mawles. 399. Gerard Gore Comenda, 31 May 1697 Yours of the 25 instant I have received. Also by the 13 hand canoa about seven thousand bricks, which was not according to expectation, but thought should had enough by the canoa to finish our tanck, according as I wrote you by the 25 instant, and that believe with our good management these wee have received will be sufficient to finish our tanck, which we shaU doe I hope in halfe a days time more, and that desire you would be pleased to send as soon as possible about two thousand more, for the pavement of our tanck within side, which we mightily want, and that if we had these bricks before might have finished our tanck before this time. Also acquainting you that we have been at a great deale of troublle in getting these bricks ashore, by reason wee Jhave but three canoas here and that they would not venture for fear of breaking and that the canoa being so large could not come above halfe way ashore, before [ = in front of] the Dutch, and then forced to put back againe, and that on Saturday night and last night they gott them all ashore at the Dutch landing place. Therefore desire you would send me a good small canoa or two, for if I should have never soe much occation for one they will not goe of here except the sea be extraordinary good indeed, nor that they will goe off a fishing for themselves , and that if I should have occation when they are fishing, have no canoa, which desire you will be pleased to consider. I am sorry that you are pleased to write me I must lett my knickknackes alone, 131 which truly I am altogether a stranger too, for all my care hitherto since I have been here has been for the Royall Companyes interest, in promoteing the forwardness of the Castle, and shall be till finished, if please God to bless me with life and health, and truely I am not mindfull of such thing yett a while. You also write me word that I gave you no accompt whither I have received the nicconees from the Dutch, which if you recall mine of 21st instant you will find at the latter end where I wrote possitively to know your pleasure whether 1 should send for them, if they sent me such word, as I also wrote you of the 2S and 26 instant, which truly I expected your orders before for my receiveing them, which as soone as [I did] I sent for them, which as I wrote you before of the 21 instant [aL"e) fourty one in whole lengths and fifty seven in peices of severall lengths, all in a very bad condition, by reason they have been in the sea, and that I am not well but thank God on the mending hand, and that I cannot give noe better discription of them as yett, but will take such care that they be looked after as may be, and by next to give you a better accompl of them. I also by the first desire some powder for Forts use, haveing formerly wrote you for some. I also desire that what you send for the future to send by seven hand canoas, and not bigger, by reason of our landing place, which may come without much danger. It is also my humble opinion that if wee should fire at the Dutch canoas here, in geeing and comeing from the landing place, that they would leave off fireing at ours, nor molest us in our landing there, which is without any danger, for which desire your orders, I holding it to be our just due, it being the better halfe way from the Dutch Fort. Paul Read still continues his sickness, or else I had sent him by the 13 hand canoa. You are also pleased to write me we have one woman slave more then you have an accompt of, which there is no more then ten women, nor never was here my time, as you will find by my inventory. Also acquainting that the 13 hand canoa went away without my knowledge, and that 1 thought she had more bricks in her then what was brought ashore the last night, but found to the contrary, and that I ordered them to carry the 7 canomen, they saying the canoa could not be mended, which since with some charge and a great deale of trouble have mended [and which] l sent by this. PS. Understanding the Fauconbergh is come, 132 desire you would be pleased to send by the first some sheets, which be the only means to bring traders downe hither, for John Cabess sayes they are mightily enquired for up in the countreys, and that the merchants cares not for comeing without they could gett some sheets, which will also be a great meanes for the dispatch of a great many other goods with them, and bring trade to the Castle, which has been but little yett, which I also begg you will be pleased to consider. 400. William Gabb Comenda, 1 June 1697 According to Mr Gores order I have note of what smiths work is wanting for the use of this Fort. He since told me you called it part knick knacks, I suppose you mean those things mentioned for which I sent a pattern. My reason was because I know the smiths are not acquainted with work belonging to building, nor are they capeable in directing me in my business. 1 am sure to my knowledge there has not been the worth of a two penny naile converted to any other use then the Royall Companyes interest. I am heartily sorry wee are obliged to trouble your worshipps soe often for bricks. I have been as frugall of them, and all other mater iaUs, as any man could have been, but those we had proved so very bad that above four thousand of them are not worth anything, and I cannot pretend to erect any building firmly without materialls proper for what they are to doe, therefore humbly begg you will be pleased to send two thousand of the best burnt bricks, for wee received not above 700, which have but just finished the arch. The seas has been soe very bad of late that the canoa durst not come on shore, and had no other then two hand canoas to unload her. Some went off in the day and sunk coming ashore, soe wee were forced to unJoad her in the night at the Dutch landing place. Wee want about 1800 bricks to floor the tanck, beside some to make the passage for the water into and out of the tanck. Pray be pleased to send the iron work before wrote for, that wee may finish the work in band, that wee may begin the other you have alread y ordered. Humbly begg wee may keep the deales I brought from Cabo Corso to make the center of the arch of the tanck, that when wee trick the center [omission], the boards for the staircase, and many other things, which I hope you will please to order part of the timber hither which I cutt at Cape Tres Pointas, which will be suitable for what we want, a I at pre ent think off. 401. Gerard Gore Commenda , 2 June 1697 Yours of the 1st instant have received, and accordingly I have wrote you of the 31st past, thinking to have sent by the 13 hand canoa, who went away without my knowledge in the night, as I wrote you by the 7 hand canoa, which we have mended up againe and sent, whom I ordered to goe last night, but found by reason of the sea that runn here, went not before the morning, by whome I sent an accompt of the shipps that came into this road a Sunday last, and sailed last night from hence, and also sent an accompt of the good[s] received from the Dutch,133 and also what I therewith wrote for, desire you will be plea ed lo send if possible. Ye terday with scarcity of bricks finished the arch of the tanck. PS. As above written the 7 hand canoa in goeing off was oversett and a little broke, which must be mended before can goe of againe, which hall end thi day, but have sent the letter by this canoa. 402. Gerard Gore Cornmenda, n.d. [3 June 1697] The enclosed letters 134 were sent on shore from an English shipp that came into the road yesterday, who I sending to know what she was, who brought an accompt she was a permission shipp from the Royall Company named the Prosper, Capt. Hohman Commander, 135 and this he desired the enclosed might be sent by the first, hee not knowing when he shall be at Cabo Corso Castle . PS. Thinking the canoa would have been mended the last night I wrote accordingly, as which is mentioned, but the wanting oe much mending as wee have done extraordinary well, and not finished her before this night, or else would have been with you before, which I humbly begg you will be pleased to excuse. 403. Gerard Gore Cornmenda, 4 June 1697 As I wrote you of the 2d instant that wee had finished our arch of our tanck, and used all our bricks, and can gett no further in our tanck for want of bricks, which desire you will be pleased to consider, and that wee may have some soe soon as possible, and also with the bricks some sheets, which will be the only meanes of bringing traid down hither, haveing had but little yett, and also some powder for the Forts use. 404. Geffard Gore Comenda, 27 June 1697 With me by the seaven hand canoe of the 24th instant I received three spung staves, one hour glass, one scaine of marlin and one houslin, 136 and some English match, gunners stores, and by this I have returned two firelock musquetts, one two hour glass, and one compas, good for nothing. Also by this according to your orders comes the surveyor, which desire you will nott detain, butt thatt you would be pleased to send him again as soone as posable, with all things necessary for the forwarding of the Castle. Also desire you would be pleased to send by the first some more sheets and one case chints, haveing had some traid since my retume. Also desire by the first you would be pleased to send two souldiers, haveing butt eight here already and half them sick & disorderd, also some flints and country match for the forts use. [PS] Abraham, a black bricklayer which came from Winnebah, desires thatt you would be pleased to give his wife leave to come and live with him here, which is now at Winnebah , her name is Pickenine Elseebah, which sayes you were pleased to promise she should, when he came from thence. By this I have returned one woman slave named Beshee, no.74, not being fitt for service, haveing lost one á hand and the use of [the] other, and desire you wou.ld send more. Also the woman named Temawoll, no.106, which you write me word was wanting, was pan yard by the Guoffoes fetching of water the 11th of March last, the same time this woman lost her hand. 405. Gerrard Gore Cornmenda, 6 July 1697 This day with the survayor by the 13 and 7 hand canoe have received 72 deale boards, and [the] canoe being nott good left part behind, two stocklocks, but the slaves which you ordered for this place the survayor could not find at his comeing away, they being not to be found, which desire you would be pleased to send by 1st opportuni ty, with some iron work to break stones, not having any left fitt for that use, but all broken, which wee shall mightily want, and by this according to your order by the survayor have sent William Woster carpenter, having paid him all his pay due to the 16th of thjs instant, deducting two pound 10s in part of the five pound which was paid him in England . Also acquainting thatt since my returne , have not been very well. I have not finished my accompts to send by this, but will send them in a day or two by furthest. Also acquainting you on the 1st of this instant two of our slave runn away from hence, one man by name Tonnee or otherwayes Stiffrump, and one woman his wife named Assebah, but the woman the next day sending to the Dutch found her there , which have received againe, and understand the man you have, which desire you would be pleased to send again, or more in his roome, and also by the l st ome country match and some flints and some spung nailes. 406.

Gerrard Gore Comenda , 17 July 1697 Yours of the 13th instant have received with my accompts , which you were pleased to retume for unreasonable charge , as you were plea ed to write, which I have rectyfied and sent per this, the ballance amounting to 4mk. 4oz Sa 3ta., which will transport to my next accompt. Allso you were pleased to write me that I have no occation to spend more powder than i allowed at other factoryes , which have not the occassion or half o much as this has, by reason of the station [= situation] as wee are in at thi place, for wee cannot gett wood nor swish without the ~xpence of powder , which I have putt downe the same quantity, tho before had not expre t the use how it was expent. Allso for palme oyle the same, which am ure expend wice the quantity of any other factory, by reason are forct to bum everall light every night. My dyett have rectyfied, and come , mallagetta, salt &ca have charged less, and am sorry you were plea ed to write me that such things is not allowed, neither done by any of my predicesors , tho am satisfied to the contrary , which truly think is very hard for slave to worke all day long from sun riseing to sun setting, and have noe time nor liberty to look for any victualis, otherwayes live upon half a chest of come a month, which will not suffice them but that I allow them a moderate allowance in reason as much as they can eat, which is more than what I have charged, and have not been wastfull of it, tho it is very bad come. Aliso for maliagett a &ca, think it more reason for slaves as work as they doe than for bought slaves, which has cost me more than I have charged, and were they to be stinched (= stinted] of what they now have would not be able to doe halfe the service as they now doe, and the want of such things would soon kill them all, which I hope you will be pleased to take into consideration, and that shall be at more expence till such time as the fort is finished then afterwards will be required, which I will forward as much as possible, and that wee are some way in our foundation but wee shall be at a great want for more slaves, which desire you will be pleased to send with all expedition , or else shall be at great expence, in hireing the townes and John Cabbess's people to help us to digg and fetch our swish, which what slaves wee have here will not be able to fetch it as fast as it will be used, by reason it will be near a mile distance from the fort.

I am also in great trouble for want of canoe men, having acquainted you in severall letters of the same, therefore humbly desire you would be pleas'd to send as soone as possible some Cabo Corso canoe men to be here, till such time these palavers are ended, 145 for if would give ever so much could not get any of these canoe men to goe anywhere, no not so much the other day to send off to give the Generali of the Brandenbergs an invitation on shore, nor to goe to Cabo Corso, which r endeavoured severall times since my last, being dayly in expectation of severall things which acquainted you off which wee here much have wanted, especially iron work to break stones, crows and wedges, for want of which have almost stood still in our building; which if had as many as have wanted might have near finished one of our flankers, which since my last have mightily forwarded, with what assistance wee have, with some alteration which have since made. Also nails of all sorts wee much want, or what can be spared of any sort, having been at some charge in employing a blacksmith here in the towne in makeing nails and mending crows and wedges, which has been very usefull unto us. The inclosed are certificates of provitions here damaged, which have through mistake neglected to send before. Also the boysadoes are all some little damaged, and will not sell at 14a, which [you] are pleased to charge, but if are pleased to order abatement of the p1ice beleive they will goe off, which John Cabbess says he acquainted you off when he was at Cabo Corso last, and were pleased to tell him you had ordered me to sell them at 12a, which could have sold some for, and no more, they being all darnnified.

Mr William Gabb surveyor lyes very sick and weak, and has been so this month, or else would have sent him per Lhis, but as soon as is able, if are pleased to send for him, will send him. Also Paul Read lyes very sick, and is not expected to recover. By thi have returned some broken iron work, not being fitt for use. Also thi now received, being so slightly made, will doe us but little service, and are not fitting for that use wee apply them to here, but per the bearer above mentioned, have senl an accompt of iron work much more fiting for breaking of stones for our building and [would] break a great many more (in halfe the time) then uch as have received hitherto, and doe a great deale more service, tho' what iron work have already received, if had been well made, would have done much more service then have, and broke stones enough to finish the flanker wee are now about, which for want of stones have been migtily our hinderance, tho' are mightily forward with il, with some part of each curtain walls adjoyning to it, and that if are not hindered as hitherto have been, shall have finished it I hope by Christmas. Therefore humbly desire what iron work have sent an accompt by bearer to be made to order to be made with all expedition, and sent as soone as possible with the bearer, [and] severaU other things therein mentioned, advised of by the 4th instant, which is here very much wanted. PS.

The building shall forward as much as possible, with what assistance have here, and that hope in a fortnights time shall fini h this flanker, and had wee had more slaves that flanker fronting the Dutch might a been as forward as that is, which desire would be pleased to send ome lusty strong slave to br ak stone , and that have imployed all the Black bricklayers this four months in breaking tone , which if had other slaves might have irnployed them otherwise, and that all that are imployed in breaking stones cannot break so many as to keep what white men doe work imp!oyed, which for this six weeks have been but three, Lawrance Brindly having had so long a distemper in his hands, not being able to use them, but almost now well againe, and Joseph Reynor ever since been here has been so sick and weak, has done little or any worke; and that considering what assistance wee have are mightily forward in our building ; and that have had great assistance both of John Cabess and towns people in fetching most of the swish wee have used, and that shall mightily want lime to pointe our walls with and build our battelements, which if have not in a fortnights time shall much want it, and stand still for want of it, which if not if have any raine, wiU much damnifie what have built, which humbly desire would be pleased to consider. Also that [you] would be pleased to send as soone as possible some good gunns, which wee shall much need, and that if would be pleased to send two or three good culverine and two or three dimme [=demi] culverine more, 146 it would be absolutely necessary, it being built and designed so very strong that it is more fitting for some such gunns then any fort upon the Coast beside, and it standing so to the sea that there is not the like contrived Castle, for its biggness, upon the Coast, both for the defence of shiping and against an enemie, had wee gunns according ly, which humbly desire would be pleased to take into consideration, which if have not some such as before mentioned, our building so strong will be insignificant. Therefore humbly desire that would be pleased to order Capt. Piles shipp hither with lime, and two or three good gunns, one or two of the above mentioned, which wee shall speedily want, which if have not so large will be to no effect, and it would be very convenient and strong against the Dutch, if should have any difference, 1.47 and that the Dutch Coapeman here sayes when this flanker is finished, and have good gunns mounted there, that the Devill will not be able to stand against it, and that he much dreads it. Therefore humbly desire that [you] would before [you] send Capt. Piles shipp of the Coast, [send it] for this place with the a:fformentioned, and a flaggsta:ff and new ffiagg, which wee much want, expecting every time these [we] have are made use of, to break downe.

Howsley Freeman Commenda , 13 Jan. 1698/9 Yours received and am heartily sorry for Mr Coopers death.185 I shall take care to have all things in a readiness against another comes to supply my place. 186 In the meane time hope to have the good news of a totall rout of our enemie s, understanding thatt Little Tagge &ca are marched towards them. 187 I have fired two or three several! times upon those which resort to the Dutch fort, and doe beleive they will venture noc more soe near us. Most of them thatt went from the towne to the Dutch side of the water are fled to the Mina because noe come nor wine can now be brought them. The woman slave which I sent downe by Mr Willson, being consarcd 188 to one thatt now lives under protection of the Dutch fort, [I] thought itt nott propper to keep her here any longer, she useing as I have been lately told to goe to him every night, soe thatt in a short time probably she might have been panyard. Mr Willson left here 30 chests of come, four small girders & 4 or 5 joysts. The rest he said could nott be come att, being laid under all the bricks thatt went for Cabo Corso. 452. Howsley Freeman Commenda, 20 Feb. 1698/9 My serjean t haveing been very sick this five or six days, and growing every day weaker, was desireous to goc for the recovery of his health to Cabo Corso. I have complyed with his request and have herewith sent him downe. I desire some other may speedily be sent up to supply his place.
