IV FORT ROYAL Fort Royal was situated only J km east of Cape Coast Castle, within clear sight of the latter, as noted in one letter in this corre pondence (no.504). Il had originally been the headquarters of the Danish West Inclia and Guinea Company, called Frederixborg, but was acquired by the RAC in 1685. In the corres.pondence of 1686-8 it was still called 'Fredericksb urgh', 1 the name 'Fort Royal' being adopted only from 1689 or 1690. It wa al o known as 'the Danes' Hill';2 or simply 'the Hill', as in some of the Rawlinson documents. Although Fort Royal was occupied continuously from the 1680s into the 1690s, correspon.dence from it in this period is recorded only from June 1691.3 In early 1694, it had ten cannon, and was judged 'impregnable by its position' , if adequately manned.4 But later in the same year heavy rains caused its partial collapse (nos 503-4), and its cannon were removed (no.506). The correspondence from it peters out in 1695, without explanation. Although not totally abandoned,5 it was evidently downgraded, and no longer had a resident Factor. The structure itself fell into neglect; as Bosman later observed, 'it lay four years [i.e. 1695-9] more like a desolate country cottage, than a fortress; its shattered walls being mended with clay, and its house within covered with reeds, as those of the 1 egroes' . Bosman also noted that reconstruction of the fort was undertaken from 1699, but this was evidently after the end of the Rawlinson correspondence in February of that year.6 Although Fort Royal did some trade, as recorded in these documents.mainly for gold, but also for corn (no.492) and on one occasion for a slave (no.476)-its principal importance was strategic rather than commercial, since it overlooked and thus potentially commanded Cape Coast Castle. 7 The corres.pondence from Fort Royal is less informative than that from other factories, being largely restricted to orders for goods and acknowledgement of their receipt. This doubtless reflects its proximity to Cape Coast Castle, which meant that more serious and urgent matters were dealt with in face-to-face meetings. 453. Edward Searle Fort Royall, 23 June 1691 If you will be pleased to Jett me have on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England some perpetuanoes , sheets, one case of fine sletias & one ditto course, 1 can sell some here.
