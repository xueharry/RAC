VI CHARLESFORT,ANOMABU Anomabu ('Annimaboe' etc.), 5 km east of Anashan, was the site of one of the principal establishments of the RAC, occupied continuously since the 1670s. The factory was fortified, and known in this period as Charles Fort; it was described in 1694 as 'pretty strong, of about eighteen guns.' 1 The Dutch West India Company also had a fort (Fort Amsterdam) in this area, at Kormantin ('Corman teen' etc.; nowadays Kormantse), 5 km east of Anomabu, which is referred to in this con-espondence. Anomabu was principally important for the supply of corn, for the provisioning of slave ships: in 1689 it was described as 'the principal granary', from which all English slavers drew their corn.2 It was also a significant source of gold, although it had a reputation for supplying adulterated gold.3 Moreover, the supply of gold in this period was subj ect to recurrent disruption. As in the 1680s, the principal traders from the interior who brought gold to Anomabu were still the Akani ('Arcany'), but Akani access to the coast was threatened in the 1690s by disputes with the state of 'Cabess Terra' (i.e. Etsi), in the immediate hinterland of Fante (nos 630, 710). Perhaps in consequence of this poor condition of the gold trade, there are more frequent allusions than in the 1680s to the purchase of slaves through Anomabu. Bosman refeITed to the problematic relations of Charles Fo11 with the local community, its occupants being 'sometimes even confined to their Fort, not being permitted to stir out', and unpopular Governors suffering deportation, 'nor are the English able to oppose or prevent it, but are obliged to make their peace by a present' .4 The Rawlinson coITespondence confirms this picture. During the 1680s, two successive chiefs of the fort had been forced to be removed, in 1686 and 1687.5 As related in this correspondence, a third, John Gregory, was likewise recalled by the Company, in May 1692, after a dispute in which he had first taken hostage several leading local traders, and then fired upon the town, k.illjng and wounding several persons (nos 646-8). Like Anashan (and Konnantin), Anomabu belonged to the state of Fante ('Fanteen '): hence 'groundrent' and 'customs' for the fort were paid to the central authorities of Fante, the 'Braffo and Corrantiers' (nos 612 etc.), and complaints about conditions in Anomabu were addressed to them (nos 594 etc.). The conespondence refers to wars of Pante, against an unnamed enemy (probably Petu, to the west) in 1691 (nos 610 etc.), and, in alliance with the Akaru, against Cabess Terra in 1693-4 (nos 706 etc.). There are also allusions to Pante involvement in the Komenda war of 1695 (nos 790 etc.), and to abortive negotiations for further intervention in Komenda later in the same year (nos 817-19) and agrun in 1697 (nos 864 etc.), and for Pante support for Akani, this time in a war against Denkyira, in 1698 (nos 903 etc.). The correspondence also documents political divisions within Pante, between the Brafo and other chiefs, which arose in prut from differences over these issues of foreign policy, and which led to the deposition of one Brafo in 1697 (nos 871 etc.), and to fighting in which another was wounded in 1699 (nos 929, 931). 594.

Parish also keeping a white man in Bonnishees house with goods. We have done very well as yett, and don't doubt but to make them comply to our just demands. I have but one months provision in the Fort, but de[s]ires you would ease me of some of the women slaves with their childreeo, being about 12 in number. I have burnt all the house[s] about the Fort & am well provided of all amunition, but powder have not above 2 barrells, desires you to supply me with some and hand granadoes.

There is no white man dares goe into the town, the sentinalls struck (and] abused in the Fort, hats stole of theire heads, threatning to put me in irons if they could gett me into the towne, in short the Fort and all that belonged to it was his (i.e. Bonishee's] and he would sell or do with it as he pleased. lf you will stand by me I do not doubt but to make a honourable palavour with them. 648. WilJiam Cross Annimabo, 12 May 1692 This accompanies Mr John Gregory, from whom as you have been pleased to order have received into my possessione Charles Fort, Annimaboe. An inventory of all goods, merchandize, stores &ca .remaining I have sent inclosed. The place is much altred since I was here last.30 Pray be pleased to make the pallavera with Bennishee and Fantine Cabbosheers, moste of our people being fearfull the Blacks will do them some mischief if they catch them opertunly out of the Castle, so I find we must be forci.ed to stand upon our own guard, admitte but few at a time and never trust them as formerly. In a day or two shall writte more at large according as I see occasione. [PS] There are 3 men killed as some say, others say 5, the town great part of it burnt togither with the peoples goods, besides what has been lost otherwise, and I think they will come upon us if this pallavera is not compounded upon sure grounds with the Fanteenes at Cape Corse. 649. William Cross Annimaboe, 13 May 1692 ot long after Mr Gregorys departure came Bonna hee[s] brother Quashee 31 and some few Cabbosheers with their usuaU complyment, after which I told them I was come to make peace and recompos se all the differances , and for the future no man whatsoever under my command should wrong nor abuse them or any of the Blacks, if they did they must make their complaint to me for satisfaction, and that at present they mu t take no exception [that] I admitted niether their boyes nor arms as formerly, for it was not the custome at Cape Corse Castle and must be no more here, neverthelesse we would live in peace and amity, and trade sbouJd be free and open, upon which they begine to bring in some provisione , and I have ordered our people to take no more custome offish, 32 and we have it brought in at reasonable rates, and I hope a.II will come to a right understanding, but they must never be trust[e]d as before , and most of our people to are [blank.]33 of being surprized by them out of the Castle. Come room and yard is unthatched and will be washed down in a weeks time if the rain containow thus , especialy [the] without part built of (blank] only, I expect every hour to fall, which have sett the slaves to thatch it if that will preserve it. Pray be pleased to send the surveyer down , that I may advice with him about the repaires of the Fort, for their is much wanting within as well as without. I have occatione for three cases of fine sletia , 50 blanket , 6 quarter casks rum and six chests of sheets, which I desire you to send on accornpt of the Royall African Company of England, togither with what lime you can. 650. Francis Smith & Hugh Dougla Charles Fort , Annimaboe, 16 May 1692 We the undernamed do humble desire that you will take our ca e into your consideration for our live i threatned every minutte by the Blacks in the town, also our boyes i threatned to be cut in era era pieces, 34 if they goe out of the gates, and he that you have sent downe our Chief i a man that will not protect us, but we are rather suspicious that he sett the Black against us, for he followes the old custome of smoaki ng and drinking, and fiJls the Castle full of the great est rogues in town, so we humbly desire that you would send down others in our places and that we may be removed, otherwise we canot think our lives in safety. This we thought fitt to acquaint you. [PS] As for my part I will take no affront neither will I give any, but the first Black that asails any white man I will certainly kill hjm. F.S 651. William Cross Charles Fort, Annimboe, 16 May 1692 14thYours of the instant I received and am glade to hear of the surveyours comeing, for we very much want him. I find their is no liveing for Mr Francis Smith and Doctor Dowglas, the Blacks will cut them in pieces if they gett them at an advantage, for a[s] soon as they come to the Castle and see them their quarrell seems to be revived. I desire therefor I desire you would be pleased to remove them, and have adviced that if anytrung should happen I may not be blamed for it. I cannot denie but they are both of them very fitt to serve the Royall Company, but will do much better in other places. 652. William Cross Charle s Fort, Annimaboe, 17 May 1692 Yours of the 16th instant with the inclosed 35 I have received, for which I retume you most heartie thanks. I know their good will now, and wish they were as carefull of themselves as I am of them all and all others the Royall Atfrican Company intrest and concemes. I need say no more but reffer you to what I wrote yesterday, which I hope you have been pleased to take into consideration. The inclosed is a pettitione of the soldiers, write and directed amongst themselves, which upon their request occasione my sending now,36 pray be pleased to remove . them all and send others in their roome, and a man or 2 more if you please as soon as possible. The come roome and wall are a great part washed down and ly open. For our security I have caused an iron chain to be fixed to the Castle gate (that being big and unwildey [=unwieldy] of itself) by which we can keep it open or shutt and non can enter butt under the chain, which we keep locked. [PS] Pray be pleased to send me a strong padlock. 653. William Cross Charles Fort, Annimaboe, [1]8 May 1692 The rain comeing in as it does, every shower goes through the tarras, I am affrayed it will rot the raft[er)s if it be not prevented in time, so that I desire you would be pleased to send the surveyour with a workman or two with matterials as soon as you can conveniently spare them, and pray advise when [=whether] you would have the come room built and thatched as before, if so I must gett the assistance of the Cabbosheer[s), for what slaves are here are not able to gett through with it. I want a window case with barrs and shutters for the warehouse, for the other is pulled down and broak to pieces and the window filled up with swish and bricks, which must be taken away again to give the goods aire. Here is little trade, nor can ] expect any as long as these interlopers ly here, so that I shall send no accompt untill the end of this month. 654. William Cross Charles Fort, Annimaboe, 20 May 1692 These accompanies Mr Francis Smith, Doctor Douglas and 6 soldiers, who came [= come} up according [to order], and upon Thomas Willsons desire have sent him up too. By this canoe have received 3 cases fine sletias, 6 chests cheets and 6 quarter cask rum containing 150 gallons rum, all on accompt of the Royall African Company of England. PS. Pray be pleased to send two more by the first conveyance, to make up the complyment as before. 655. William Cross Charles Fort, Annimboe, 27 May 1692 These are to acquaint you that yesterday morning came all the Cabbo beer of the towne to demand their custome upon a new Chief settling. They had several! other pallavers, as is usuall at such times, of little or no consiquence, the most matteriall wa in sho1t this, they told me that 6 men were killed and dead of their wounds and 6 more lay so that they thought they would not recover, and that upon fireing the town several! people lost a great many goods besides what were burnt, and they would know of me how [ = who] must pay for all this. I told them I was not here then and could say nothing to it, and thought their pallavour had been made up at Cabo Corsoe Castle, upon which thei.r was a hott debate amongst them for some time till Bonashee stood up and paceifyed them, and after silence they told me what I said was true, and that we were all new men and had done them no banue, and should receive non from them or any of their people, and that they would trouble me no more about this pallavour, and departed very [blank]. I desire you would be pleased to order their custome to be paid, the particullars of which Mr John Gregory left with me as he paid by his accompts, which I hope will confirme all better. PS. The Cabboosheers desire you Lo accept of Bonashee for a pawne for [him] , and he and they will see his debts paid in gold and come in a short time, for if be lies at Cape Coa t and nobodie to look after his busines he will not be able to pay you. 656. William Cross Charles Fort, Annimaboe, 3 July 1692 By the bearer I have sent my accompts and balance, mk.4 60 10a 4ta in good Fanteen gold.37 It is most for fine sletias and damniefyed goods, which I think is better to dispose on then to lett them ly and grow worse. Besides here is tallow, snaphancees , musquetts &ca which will never turne to accompt, and the tallow, being some without and some in broken casks, will be eaten quite up by the rates [=rats] if not removed, I desire you will be pleased to send for them up. We find more goods damnified then per last inventory, becaus the warehouse was dark, the windoes being filled, could not so well look over them as we have done since.3 course sletias I have disposed at 4a each, which were mentioned good but there is never a good man amongst them all, and if you look over all the accompts of Annimaboe you will hardly find any disposed of since they were raised from 4 to 5 angles, which is above two years since. I had no peace nor quiteness with the Cabbosheers before I had paid them their custome at a new Chiefs settling, and I was unwilling to trouble you any further, hearing you were all indesposed, becaus it is no more than what others has paid and been allowed att their first settling . 657. William Cross Charles Fort, Annimaboe, 3 July 1692 I have by the bearer sent you 2 small bulces of Arcania gold, one containing rnk3 & [the other) 1oz 14a. The former I am indebted to you 4 quarter cask rum, for the other 15 gallons brandie at my comeing down. I am very sorrie to hear of the losse of Mr Elwes, but Doctor Douglas letter other day was a great comfort when he advised of your recovery, I hope you will keep yourselves as you are. If Mr Bloome comes not up till you hear out of England, 38 if not be p leased to look upon me as oldest factor, for I have been here this last time seven years if I Jive till October, ;ext Chief of outFactory, 39 and have latly given the Company 1000 pounds security,40 of which I had advice by Capt. Butteram, but I will trouble you no further.41 658. William Cross Charles Fort, Annimaboe, 8 July 1692 Desem ing (= discerning] the dust alwayes thi[c]k upon my desk and table, tho often cleansed, this afternoon I took particular notice of it, and examining the guirder direct over I found it eaten very neer through with the wormes, as rotten as dirt for about 3 foott and the rafters ready to drop out in so much l am fea1full [of] its falling , which makes me give you this trouble now, desireing you would be pleased to send the surveyour with a new guuirder , which I believe may be fastened in the wall to support this till [it] can more conveniently be taken up, for what is done must be done out of hand one way or other. If l had not seen it as I did it had certainly been down altogether , therefor pray send present help. There is fifteen foot from wall to wall. I have occasione likewise for 2 casks lime and 3 cases fine sletias , if any of [them] are damnified be pleased to value them before they come down & send by this conveniency , and by the returne of the canoe may be sent up these musquets &ca before mentioned . Here will be no come fitt to take in this fortnight or 3 weeks, as soon as there is shall advise you . I hope these lines will find you in good health. 659.

Bonnashee and the Cabbosheer s are not yet come down from danceing, 42 and those that have come ay [sic: = ?] here dare not Jett me have any, for fear of being apprehended by them before they have pallaverd about the disposal! of it, so I can gett non to send by this canoe, but hope by the next conveniency to have some ready. 660. William Cross Charle s Fort , Annimaboe, 18 July 1692 By the retume of the 11 band canoe have sent you 20 chests come for accompt of the Royall African Company of England at 2a per chest, which is as cheap as it can be purchased at present, much of the come being spoyled by the great rains fell thi year. 661.

I shall have occasion for 20 blue Welch plains, 30 firkins of tallow and 40 course sletias for purchaseing corne, which I desire you to send on accompt of the Royall African Company of England.

I humbly desire you excuse my not writting, being very much troubled with the gripes, by reasone of cold which I have taken lying out of my roome. 663. Thomas Buckeridge Charles Fort, Annimaboe, 29 July 1692 This comes with the bad news of Mr Crosses death, who departed this life bettween 1 and 2 a clock this afternoon, haveing made no will nor other settlement of his concerns, which are at present in my custodie, I therefor humbly desire you will please with all expedition signify your pleasure in this disastrous affair, which shall punctually be observed. 664. Thomas Buckeridge Charles Fort, Annimaboe, 31 July 1692 Yours I received, and according to your orders have sent up Mr Cross chest with all the rest of his things , saveing a little rum & suggar which remains in the warehouse, with 2 or 3 nessissarys of little or no value, which I sup.pose whomsoeever you please to send Chief will buy.

I have also sent hi ring and a bulce of money containing lOta, which I had from the serjeant, which he sayes and 1 verryly beljeve was all he took out of the deceaseds pockett , which he keeped in hope you would please as customary to allow him for striping the departed. He has as he report nothing more then a hirt, old westcote [ = waistcoat], pair of stocking , hoee , silver buckles and britches [= breeches], which if you please you may end [for] per the next conveniency. Mr Searle if you please will buy his . box of candles, remaining uggar and rum. Some thing I thought were his I am told belong to the Company, haveing remained in this Factory a considerable time, so that I know of nothing more then a pair of stillyards and old broken ca e and candlestick . At the time of his decease and Jong before, [I] was very ill myself of a violent feavear and ague and loosnesse, insomuch that I could not overlook his concerns with the care I should otherwise have done, but to my knowledge he hath not been defrauded of anything, notwithstanding the malitious censures of peace breaking and ill minded men, but in all things [I] have acted no worse then, should it please God to bring me to the like estate, I de i_re to be used. 667. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annimaboe, 13 Aug. 1692 Bonishee and the rest of the Cabbosheer of this place have been at me for their customes at the ettleing of a Chief , which I thought needfull to advise you off before I pay any. Our come roome is likewise in very bad condition, and without the help of the free people wiU not be fitting to receive come this year. Here is several! blacks demands amongst them aU payment for 8 chests come at 2a per chest and one goat at 4a, which they tell me is due to them by Mr Cross.

The bricklayer teJls me he will want 1000 bricks. The canoe is staved so as that she cannot retnme without mending. The bearer hereof is one of the canoe men, which comes to you for iron work for her. At her returoe shall send what come she can convenientyly carry. PS.

Here is John Ladd and Thomas Tunbrige, two very refractory fellows not fitting to be at an outfactory, especialy where we must be so cautious of the natives as here we must be. When I was l.ast at Cabo Corso they were very troublesome and would owe[= own] no supperior. I humbly desire that if the canoe that bring the goods be not gone that I may have two civell men in their places and per retume shall send them up.

Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annimboe, 20 Oct. 1692 When I came here I was unacquainted with what belonged to the Fort, but what we could informe ourselves of we put into the inventory. What I find more then what was put into the inventory is one iron gunn not serviceable, a drum, 4 pair irons, one maule, part of a cask tarr, one hand vice. For the green perpetuanoes it was a mistake in the coppying the inventory, for I find in mine 82, and likewise for the great shott and musquett shott I told Mr Platt49 was made away whith by John Pimm in Mr Cross's time. The serjeant tells me the firelock musquetts were sent to Cabo Corso in Serjeant Willsons time, and I suppose the sword. The old canoe before I saw this place was a good part used and cut in pieces. The iron barrs for the windoes or anything elce that is wanting, I can no way inforrne myself of them, if I find any I shall take as much care of them as if they were in the inventory .

My not ending accompts was not for self ends or anything like. Itt was the 2d instant when returned from you a[t] Christmas , & have been troubled with people ever since for Chtistmas dashees, soe thought that, takeing noe mony, att the end of the month might doe as well.

The strong sea breas has broken almost all the windoees we have, I desire I may have [them] as soon as can be made, for want of which many of our windoes are forceid to be unhinged. The bricklayer haveing finished his work went from hence last Saturday. [PS] One of the slaves I have last from you tells me att Christmass you gave him leave to bring his wife, which without your orders I cannot charge her pay, but the woman I have no need of, its men we want. 690.

The liquors and paper brawls and other things which they demand amounts to about one ounce. The men are willing to serve the Royall Company, and [pay] what is paid the natives for them, so when I have your orders sha.LI observe them, and if you think convenient shall send down for the other two. They came from the interlopers, two from Capt. Hogben57 and two from the Barbadian.

Next weeke I doubt not but to have the full quantity you ordered me to purchase . I desire two bailes more of plaines and some sheetes to be sent next opportunity. The knives that are remaining here are so very bad that I was forst to give the Cabbosheers 24 dozen for cuting their small come, and that would hardly content them. The slave run away i certainly gone to Accra or Quamboo ,58 his brother has the comand of Daines fort as the Black .inform me,59 so that if you advise Mr Bloome of him he may gett him or atisfaction for his freedome. [PS] I desire if you are supplyed with paper to send me a little per bearer I have not two sheetes in the fort, nor any of my neighbours so well toct as to spare me any. 695.

I humbly desire a few nailes as soon as possibly, the spouts of our Lank are very much out of order and many other things here, and not a nail in the Fort. [PS] Humphry & all others that is indebted to Mr Gregory shall not want pressing to pay me, l believe Humphry may pay his all this seaso n, he gives faire promises. 699. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annamaboe, 25 Sept. 1693 This serves only to advise you that this morning I had a messenger from the Braffo to desire me that I would give you advise that the Anguinas and Quamboes has agreed to assist you in building a fort at Wyneba h but neve[r] intends it shall be finished, for the Quamboer s are preparing themselves to paniard all the white men and the Royall Companies concemes. 61 Whether he sends this message for selfe ends, that there may not be [a) fort there to hinder his customes here , or whether be be reall, l know not, but rathe r beleive it selfe ends then otherwayes, however thought it my duty since I had fresh advise to acquaint you with it. 700. Edward Searle Charles Fort Annamaboe, 2 Oct. 1693 The Swallow, Capt . Richard Bradshaw, is arrived at Amersa & has sent to me to supply him with oystershell , so this is to de ire canoes to carry them off. If you send two canoes they wiJl sooner lade him. The canoe must call here to take the butt, and the men hall returne by ]and, & the Amersa canoemen carry off the shells . Capt. Bradshaw de ires to know whether he i to send a man ashore, or to have a man from here to take accompt of the shell , his boatswaine being very ill, for when I have your orders shall gett him loaded with aJl the speed I can. Here is not a taccoe of gold to be taken, so shall referr my accompt to the end of thi month. 701. Edward Searle Charles Fort Anamaboe, 5 Oct. 1693 Yours of yesterdays date I have received. The 5 hand canoe have sent to Amersa, & have sent Thomas Farr from hence to see that they dispatch Capt. Bradshaw as soon a po sibly. ln yours you order me to tell Thoma Tunbridge go to Anishan to worke for Mr Smith. I desire you not to think I am o ill a neighbour to deny him or any man el e o small a kindne , was he not so abusive as you are sensible he is. This same Tunbridge has worked for him at his own house several I dayes together, and [he] was never denyed hi worke or any thing I had in the fort, till he had so often abused me to my face in this fort & several I other places. None of our people can go thether but he i degrading me to them, which I think is beneath a factor so to uter his mind to a soldier. He hath often said he will do hi utmost to ruine me, if he leave himselfe not worth a groat, which has made me deny my elf and all that is under me going to his factory, but all those abuses shall not move me to disobey your order , although I should be very glad that you would excuse me in thi . I should never have troubled you with the difference between us did I not tb.ink by yours that he has wrote a.lready against me.62 [PS] Since the writing of thi I understand he ha wrote to my second & the said souldier to come to him without my leave, & that I am ordered not to hinder them. If it be so I cannot perceive I have any comand of my men. 702. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annimaboe, 8 Oct. 1693 This serves to advise you that ye terday sending by Aonisham 13 perpetuanoes which I trusted Captain Amo of Cabo Corso to sell for me, here being not any trade to defray the charges of the factory, there was 2 stoped by the Annisham people, the other are in the faclory63 as I understand this morning. They was taken from my own slaves who I sent to carry them, so referr my selfe for you to order how TshaU gett satisfaction for the affront given to the Royall Company by those rogues. If Jett run on shall have nothing pass for them. I suppose if you order Mr Smith he can gett the other two, 1l he has in his possession. 64 PS. Since I wrote this my boy told me that in the morning when I sent him to Annishan & about it, that Mr Smith told him he thought they were interloper goods & that he had advised you purposely to play the rogue with me,65 which as he is mistaken, l hope you wiU take it as a roguish trick, and if that they had been another mans, he would not have medlcd with them, so I hope you will require them all of his hands. [PPS) The Kinge of Saboe is now in this fort.66 Charles Fort, Annamaboe, 9 Oct. 1693703. Edward Searle Being senceable of the envy & mallice that my neighbo ur Smith bares me and not knowing how maliciously bee may have writl against me, I humbly desire you to grant mee leave to come up to Cabo Corso, and I doubt not but to cleare myselfe of all his asspenions. Charles Fort Annamaboe, 3 Nov. 1693704. Edward Searle According to yours of the 13th October I have received from Mr Thomas Smith lhe 13 perpetuanoes which was seized by the people of Annishan. The Welch plaines sent the 21st September was very much damnified, as you will finde by the inclosed certificate. The Brigantine, Capt. Bradshaw , bas on board eighty butts of shells. The two canoes are here, they may serve to load her once more, which I beleive will bee all, for they are old and not worth sending up to your parts. This accompanyes my accompts for September and October. Here is noe manner of trade nor like to bee any, not soe much as to defray factory charges. The come ordered mee to purchase I have taken in the best pan of itt. Charles Fort Annamaboe, 8 Nov. 1693705. Edward Searle I am forced to trouble you with this through the impudence of Humphry Lowe which [you] sent hither Serjeant. Hee has been noe wayes forbearable to mee since he has been here, nor is hee fitting for the place hee is in, but I have endeavoured to beare with him as much as is po ible. Yesterday hee came to mee and told mee hee was inform'd that I had said I would send him to Cabo Corso, and if I dared doe it, hee would have mee doe it then, and that it was more ! then I had power to doe, bee being placed by you, and that if I would send him up hee would desire noe better port, for hee i ure you will not give him armes, 67 but preferr him, and that hee would doe my busines, and a great deale more of such impertinent language. I put him in prison till this momjng, and bee still continueing in the same minde, with unsufferable dareing language, I have by a two hand canoe sent him up, and humbly desire you will bee pleased to send me a man which may bee fitting for such a place as this is, you being sencible that the atives are very unruly in these parts, and r quires a carefull Se1jeant. Had hee not been soe very impertinent, which is an ill example to the souldiers, I should not have sent him up till had yom orders. I have paid him his pay to the tenth of this month . 706. Edward Searle Charles Fort Annamaboe, 22 Nov. 1693 This comes by Boneshees boy, who is sent by him and the Cabesheirs of thls place, and is to desire to bee trusted two barrells of powder and six Lead barrs to carry on their warr against Cabess Terra, being resolved to fight this month, 68 which if the warr wa once ended I doubt not but wee should have had a brisk trade. "When they goe from hence l have promi ed them two leade bans and some powder as a da hee from myself, and offered them soe fair, that if they would give mee a good gold pawne, I would trust them with what powder they want to can)' on their warr. They told mee they had noe pawne to give mee, but very desirous I hould acquajnt you with jt. If I could have pacified them I should not have troubled you with this, soe a you are pleased to order I hall answer them according. 707. Edward Searle Charle Fort, Annimaboe, 29 Nov. 1693 According to yours of yesterdays date by thi canoe I have sent by [sic) Mr John Pinck.69 Some tyme since I desired a carpenter to make door cases for the doors and other worke which wee are in great want of, and if not soon mended the Fort will want as much tymber as would halfe build of a new . Om prison is o out of repair that wee cannott safely keepe a slave in itt. If you please to send tymber fitt for such uses, with some brick and lyme, and uch tools as are at the foot hereof , I can gett such things done here by a Black fellow, wh ich with directions will doc well enough. And likewise I can have all iron work that is wanting made here if you please to order it, for want of which all things rnns to ruine here. Sirs, this morneing the Cabbosheers were here to ask mee what I would give them to goc fight. I told them I would give them two lead barrs and eight cartridges powder. They demanded a barrell and four leade baITS,and because I did not comply with such unreasonable rogues, they went out in a huffe, as they always doe if they are contrad icted in their demands. I desire to bee advised if there bee anythi ng aJlowed them or not, soe that I may give them an answer at once . I think it is unreasonable they should bee complyed with in such demands, except these factoryes made better returnes then for these severall years they have done. l desire once more to have Thomas Tunbridg e removed, who is very troublesome and not fitting for a place where there is but six men. I shall not enlarge, but if you please to enquire of Mr Pinck he can satisfye you about him. PS. I have received the mmm. Send per Brigantine tools: 2 hammers, 2 hand sawes, 3 chisells, 1 hatchit, 1 adds [= adze], 3 a[ug]er s of several! sizes, 6 gimlett s, 3 plaine s. 708. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annimaboe, 2 Dec. 1693 Yours of yesterdays date I have received, and see you doe not allow of any powder or leade barrs to the Cabboshecrs. They say they had it the last warr.70 If anything was allowed to bee given them, I desire there may bee the same allowance now, or here will bee no Liveing. I desire on accompt of the Royall African Company of England, twenty barre ls gunpowder, ten whole barrills and twenty halves, also one hundred perpetuanoes blue & some sheets. I desire 1may have it a Munda y, for wee arc very bare of powder, I have only a barreU in the Fort that is good. 709. Edward Searle Chari.es Fort Annamaboe, 5 Dec. 1693 Yours of yesterdays date by the 11 hand canoe I received, with thirteen barrells powder and one hundred perpetuanoes blew, and Robert Jackson to remai ne in the room of Thomas Tunbrid ge, who goes by this said canoe. Also I have sent you on accompt of the Royall African Company of England five good men slaves. I desire by the returne of this bearer twelve pairs of Negroe irons and two dozen rivetts. I have been ill this 3 or 4 [days], or should have sent my accompts before this tymc. 710. Edward Searle Charles Fort Annimaboe, 9 Dec. 1693 Yours of the 6th instant have received. You advice mee that one of the slaves sent you is bur ten [ = bursting]. I thought soe myselfe at first, but the Negroe told me it was a worme. However, if hee bee not passible, if you retume him I must take him againe. This accompts [are] for November. 1 hope in a short time this warr between the Cabess Terra and the Arcanye will bee at an end, and then I doubt not but wee hall have a good trade. 711. Edward Searle Charles Fort Annimaboe, 11 Dec. 1693 Yours of the 9th instant with my accompts I have received, which you returne by reason of come charged for the use of the slaves. Three of them I have kept above six weeks and the other two a full month, and I never knew but come was allowed for them. If I have charged more then you think they may have eaten, I will give the Royall Company credit for as much as you please to order in my next accompts. As for sending slaves by land, is more than ever was or can safely bee done. Mr Smith sends them, because hee hath noe place to keepe them, soe that bee is forsed to doe it, or run the risk of losing them, but here useth to bee irons and all things allowed for their use, till opportunity of a canoe pre ent, and I desise it may bee still the ame, and when any canoes comes to these parts, if I have any laves . hall send 'ern up. I hope after this warr, if the Arcannes have good succe , that more slaves may offer then will bee convenient to end by Jand.71 712. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annimaboe, 14 Dec. 1693 This is to de ire on accompt of the Royall African Company of England ten chests of heets, if you have them. For want of sheets I have lost the buying of several! laves, which are carried to the Dutch,72 who have enough to supply them by severall passage 73 as has been here. I am ure that the Dutch are endeavouring to draw the Ferner and the Cabess people under theis protection , to bring the Arcany and Fanteener to make up he pallavera to their owne advantage,74 and if they cannot bring them to comply they will protect the former till they have the Quifferas and Dankeras to their assistance.75 This I thought not amiss to informe you of, I being certain it is true. As yet the Arcanies have had good success.76 713. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annabamoe, 16 Dec. 1693 Yours of yesterdayes date have received. When I hear farther of the Generall of the Mynees [= Mines] proceedings shall advise you. With this goes a Dutchman that came from Amersa, left out of an interloper, who is desirous to serve the Royall African Company. 714.

Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annimaboe, 29 Dec. 1693 Just now I have advice from Capt. Bradshaw that one of the canoes is staved and the other much out of repair, soe desires another canoe, and a considerable quantity of staples, with two or three hundred odd of great nailes.79 716. Edward Searle Charles Fort Annamaboe, l Jan 1693 [= 1694) Yours of this date 1have ju st received and per the bearer I have sent five yards violett coulored cloth, which is all I have left. I desire on accompt of the Royall African Company of England two pieces of broad listed red cloth to bee sent mee tomorrow, for the Cabbosheers have beene with mee for there Christmas dashees. My slaves are sick and lame, or should have sent them for itt. I desire a good man slave in the roome of him that runn away, for those that are here are not able to doe the worke of the Fort. 717. Edward Searle Charles Fort Annamaboe, 3 Jan. 1693/4 This is to desire the red cloth desired in my last, for I shall never bee at rest for the Cabbosheers till they have their dashees, and also a man slave in the room of him that ran away.

Here is noe trade as yett.80 The natives gives great promises that wee shall have a free trade from the Arcanyes in a little tyme , but I much doubt the warr will bee another yeares dispute. The bricklayer you sent downe continued can doe noe more worke without the timber that is wanting, with lime and bricks considerable, which I suppose the surveyor satisfyed you at hi retume from hence . Here is not a drop of raine but it comes downe into all our roomes . The pout of the tanck is soe that wee catch noe water, and a great many other things which wants to bee repaired aboute the fort, which if not done before the raines a great part of it will fall. When the canoes brings downe bricks &ca I desire the canoe men may bee looked after to load the canoe, for a 11 hand canoe brought downe noe more then five quarter cask lyme and aboute two hundred of bricks, which would have brought twice the quantitie. The first instant I received two women slaves from Mr William Cooper. 8 1 719. Edward Searle Charles Fort , Annamaboe , 13 Feb . 1693/4 This is onely to desire a man slave in the roome of him that is run to Quamboe.

I desire you will bee pleased to end downe by this canoe the gate case, and in two dayes it will bee finished. I desire it may be seaven foot high and four foot and a halfe wide. 721. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annamaboc, 3 March 1693/4 This accompanyes my February accompts. Trade is worse here now than ever, and I see but small hopes of better.85 If the surveyor be come from windward I desire he may be sent downe, with a carpenter and another bricklayer, for the bricklayer that is here I am afried will lose the use of his hands, and if not I am ccrtaine he cannot by himselfe repare the Fort before the raines. 722.

This morning they told me if I would give 2a per chest I should have the quantity that I desired, under they would sell none, sayi ng the Mine people paid more in ready money. The lime I received shall not be wasted, but spent where necessity forces, which is really almost over all the fort. I desire per first opportun ity of faire weather the lime & tarras desired in my last, that I may have what leakes stopt I can, for the timber daily receives damage by the raines. I have received the particulars mentioned in your last of the l 81h instant. 729. Edward Searle Charles Fo1t, Annamaboe, 28 May 1694 Yours of the 261h instant I have received. The advice I gave Mr Bloome was according as you ordered. Here each shipp had one hundred seventy & seven chests,90 att Agga fifty chests each,91 and att Annishan forty each. I advised Mr Bloome that the Hanniball had five hundered fifty eight chests and the East India Merchant four hundered ninety two chests, and at the foot of his letter an accompt particularly what they had att each place. I humbly desire the lime & tarress, for our battlements arc soe leaky that we are forced to sett quarter casks to catch the water. Alsoe I desire twenty cases spirits on accompt of the Royall African Company of England. The forty plaines received in Aprill, one bale was good the other seven of them damaged as per the inclosed certificate. As for come here is plenty enough, the Mine people carryes of as much in a month at our landing place as we have occasion for, soc that we pay customes to a parcel! of rogues for nothing. I humbly desire you will please to send me my sallary to the 24th instant. 730. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annamaboe, 31 May 1694 Yours of yesterdayes date by the 11 hand canoe with twenty cases spirits and the lime & tarress I have received. The Fort shall be repai red as much as can be without timber as soon as we have fair weather. If the raines continues much longer a great part of it will fall. I desire as soone as possible a gate for our spurr as it may be finished. Here is a parcel) of loose beads, I desire to be advised how many pounds I may sell for one angle, the Blacks haveing vi(e]wed them several! times and sayes if they can have them reasonable they will buy the best part of them. By this canoe I have sent one man & woman slaves which I received from Mr Cooper on accompt of the Royall African Company.92 731. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annamaboe, 18 June 1694 I am verry sorry for the losse of Royall Companyes concerns at Succondee. 93 I shall be very carefull who I trust into the Fo1t, for I have been ever rnistrustfull of these blacks since I have been here, and I beleave none more ready to doe anything that may tend to their [=the Royal Company's) disadvantage then them, had they but any opportunity. The Dutch ha there Fort soe well maned that they never fear. Corrnantine, a place that is but little bigger than this, has never less than twenty odd men. I hope , considering that the loss of these three Factories 94 depends on this, and that blacks begin now to surprise Forts, you wiU be pleased to order me four men more, which may keep the blacks under and cau e them to lay such thoughts aside, which otherwise they may attempt to make u e of, knowing how weakly we are manned. I hope I shall uddenly have a good gate for our spurr as it may be finished, which will be of great strength to us. Our guns are mightily out of order. Wee are in great want of the carriages, and likewise of the door & window cases formerly desired . I desire a few spunge nailes, c[r]owes for stone, baggs and old junck for the gunners use, alsoe nailes for the use of the Fort, for I have not a naile whatever occasion we have for them. I desire a few granadoes that are well fixed, and fire lock musquets in the roome of them I sent up, three of the twelve I received are good for nothing. Wee have been forced to use more lime about the Fort than we thought for, soe shall be in want of a hogshead more to fini h the spur, which I desire with the gate. 732. Edward Searle Charles Fort , Annamaboe, 20 June 1694 This is to desire on accornpt of the Royall African Company of England one hundred & fifty perpetuanoes blue , with the men & necessaries desired in my last. I desire they may be ent the first opportunity of fare weather. 733.  Edward Searle  Charles Fort, Annamaboe,  22 June 1694  This is to desire that the perpetuanoe I wrote for in my la t may be sent to me  tomorrow morning.  734. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annarnaboe, 26 June 1694 Yours of yesterdays date I with one hundred twenty five perpetuanoe blue I have received. By this canoe I have sent you on accompt of the Royall African Company of England three men & one woman slaves. 735. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annamaboe, 28 June 1694 I desire on aecompt of the Royall African Company of Eng land twenty screwed jugg s if you have any, I desire they may be sent me in the morning. 736. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annamaboe, 30 June 1694 Yours of yesterdays date with twenty screwed juggs I have received. 737 . Edward Sear le Charles Fort, Annamaboe, 5 July 1694 This accompanys my accompts for May & June , and is to desire on accompt of the RoyaU African Company of England thfrty cases spiritts. 738. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annamaboe, 12 July 1694 Accordi ng to your orders of the 9th instant I have been an Agga and have rated the sayes as you will finde per inclosed certifica te.95 The Briganteen, Capt. Bradshaw, is arrived att Amersa, which will be loaded as soon as the seas be downe. 96 If you please to order him to putt thirty butts of shells on shore here, which may be burnt with little or no charge, the Fort may be repaired as it should be. It is soe farr gone to ruine that it cannot be repaired with the lime sent from Cabo Corso without a great deale more charge. The little tower over the staircase is soe cracked with the raines, being built onJy with swish, that if it be not covered over with lime & haire it wrn certainly fall in the latter raines. Besides the hall & the seco nds roorne must be taken up, which will take a great deale of lime, and many other repairs wanting, which may be soon done if we had materialls, lime is the cheifest I desire the gate for the spurr. 739. Edw ard Searle Charles Fo1t, Annamab oe, 17 July 1694 According to your orders of the 13th instant I have been at Annis han and inventoried the Royall Compa nys concemes, and Mr John Pinck have received the same into his possession. The goods are but little damage d more than before, but the upper warehouse has been broak open, the seale of the window & doore broak, and likewise a great place in the scaling [=ceiling] of the roome. The goods wanti ng are 10 perpetuanoes, one say, two lead barrs & two pautk.ies, as you will finde by the incloscd inventorie s. I told Capta in Cuffee what you wrote, he says he will make an inquiry and belcives he may finde the thcif. 97 He says he panyard two perpetuanoes from a black who told him he bought them of me, the same are still in his possession and he beleives he shall find that fellow guilty, but I beleive him to be a subtile rogue . Thomas Farmer went in at the place that was broak at the sealing to naile up the window as he told us, which is all I can advise you of it. When Capt. Bradshaw has thirty butts of shells on board he may saile hither & putt them on shore, then faU down and take his loading againe if you please to order it soe. Inclosed is ten angles & four taccoes, being the estate of Robert Knightly deceased, which I charged in my last accompts. His old clothes just satisfied those which he was indebted to. PS. I desire the spur gate with one hogshead lime to sett it in, as I may have it finished before wee burn the shell . 740. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annamaboe , 19 July 1694 Yours of yesterdays date with the nailes & staples I have received, which I have forwarded to Capt. Bradshaw. Per the 11 hand cauoe have sent on accompt of the Royall Company twenty five chests come. 741. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Anoamaboe, 26 July 1694 Yours of yesterdayes date I have received, and by the 11 hand canoe I have sent on accompt of the Royall African Company of England twenty one chests of corn & two men & one woman slaves. I have the shells on shore, and the Briganteen will saile downe to Amersa today. I desire the lent [ = loan] of ten slaves, either men or women, to assist us in getting wood, and setting our kills to burne the Uroe for about fortnight, and then I will returne them. Capt. Bradshaw desires more staples , those he received are all used. I desire the caniages for our guns, with the other carpenters worke formerly desired. I have not above 3 gunns that are fitt for service. Alsoe some nailes, I have not a naile in the Fort what occasion soever we have of them. 742. Edward Searle Charles Fort , Annamaboe , 30 July 1694 By this two hand canoe I send a woman slave which I received from Mr Cooper, and by retume of the same I desire on accompt of the Royall African Company of England ten redd perpetuanoes and one hundred two pound pewter ba ons. What pewter is here is soe fowle [ = foul] that it wiU never sell. 743. Edward Searle & William Cooper Charles Fort , Annamaboe, 2 Aug. 1694 This serves only to advise you that we hear that Tuesday morning before day the second of Cormantine 98 by the Generall of the Mines order went upp secretly to the Bra:ffo of Fantine, under a pretence to goe a fowling, on what intreague we cannot rightly understand. We have heard various repo11s, some say it was to gett the Fantiners to assist Great Taggee of Aguaffo agains t the Quifferas,99 others that it was to tell him that the Generali heard that the English had hired him to take Connantine Fort and desired him to certifie h.im of the truth, but rather beleive it to be some designe against us, the Braffo & Currantiers haveing been lately very huffish. This we thought needfull to advise you of. 744. Edward Searle Charles Fo11, Annamaboe, 7 Aug. 1694 This accompanys my July accompts. The second of Cormantines message to the Braffo was that the Generall had heard that the English had given him and the Currantiers a considerable sumrne of money to surprise their Fort, which the Braffo assured him was very false. This as farr as I can learn was the reason of his goeing up, 100 but however I shall be very cautio us of the Blacks. I desire the spurr gate may be sent downe, with some sparrs and deale boards for scaffolding, and that the great canoe may be loaded with what bricks she can carry. soe that the bricklayer may doe all things about the Fort as can be done without a carpenter. The briganteene is loaded, and the canoes are here. They are very old, if you please to order them up shall send them. I have satisfied the Braffo and Cabbosheers of this place with old kn ives for their customes of cutting small come, but the Currantiers would not take any, nor the vallue in other goods, but will have good knives or nothing. Their due is two dozen. 745. Edwa rd Searle Charles Fort, Annamaboe, 8 Aug. 1694 Yours of yesterdays date with the gate of our spurr I have received. Corne I have not to load the ca~oe, soe sent her to Mr Cooper. 101 I have returned in her the four window cases, being of noe service here. The window case desired was for our prison, which should be very strong. I desire the canoe may be returned with bricks &ca as I wrote yesterday, and will endeavour to gett come to load her up. Here are noe barrs or staples or anything to the gate. I desire an iron barr & staples, and hooks for two wooden baJTS. He that made the gate can give the smith the length to make the iron barr. [PS] Our lime is burning. The bricklayer desires a si[e]ve to sift it as he takes it in, soe desire a sive may be sent by a slave. I have not a slave to send, or would have sent one for it. 746. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annamaboe, 9 Aug. 1694 Yours of yester daye date with the bricks & boards I have received. Inclosed isthe dementions of the timber worke we want, and noe more than what we havejust necessity for. The guns, none of the five can be fired till we have thecarriages. I desire six peices of timber that are fitting for the joyc of a roome, and l have a Black fellow here which will take up the second's roome wellenough, and till it be done we cannot fire the gunns that stands on that roome,and for the hall I hope that by that time all the fort is repaired you may have acarpenter to send down and take up that. Come l am afraid will be at anexcessive rate after once it is housed. The neighbouring countrys being at greatwant, here are continually forty or fifty Mina canoes buying come. I shallendeavour, as soon as it is fitting to take in, to purchase the quantity ordered. 747. Edward Searle Charles Fort , Annamaboe, 15 Aug. 1694 This is to de ire on accompt of the Royall African Company of England onehundred & fifty perpetuanoes blue, fifty ditto red, and four hundred one poundpewter bason . J desire I may not faile of them early in the morning. 748. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annamabo , 16 Aug. 1694 Yours of this date I have just received , with the particulars therein mentioned.This is to desire if you have any more one pound bason , that you would bepleased to send me four hundred more by a two handed canoe . I de ire sixhundred if you can spare them, for want of which shall loose the takeing of threeor four marks of gold, I desire them this night. 749. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annamaboe, 17 Aug. 1694 By the 11 hand canoe I have sent on accompt of the Royall Company twenty fivechest come . 750. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annamaboe , 22 Aug. 1694 Your of yesterdaye date wee have received. Come what wee gett att present is very inconsiderable, the Mina people buying uch great quantitie s as well a allother provitions, which will cause a great scarcety. Our endeavours shall not bewanting, but doe fear shall not gett it under 2a per chest. Slaves it cannot beexpected wee hall gett (and the ship is in your parts) 102 att the prizes you formerly ordered, 2oz on board, being better then 2oz 8a ashore, considering the prizes of the goods, 103 but doc believe if wee may give 2oz a man and 7 peaze a woman wee may purchase what are to be had here. 751. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Anoarnaboe, 22 Aug. 1694 By this two hand canoe goes William Reeves, an impertinent mutinous fellow. Last night happened a differance between John Ladd and the Serjeant. Ladd being very troublesome I putt him in prison to keep them quiett. A while after this Reeves & two more of our fellows were designing to take him from thence per force, and told me they would not be kept prisoners, as they say they are, because I order them none shall goe any distance from the Fort, without my knowledge, any further than to gett provitions, for when they had their liberty then all ran out of the fort att a time, and gott drunk with palmc wine, that l had noe gove rnment amongst them. The other two craveing pardon , pretending they were in drinck, and Reeves being very sawsey [= saucy), I have given him condigne punishment for an example to the rest. PS. Had not Mr Cooper & Mr Pinck both been here, I doe not know what such rogues might have pretend[ed) to have done, soe thought such a thing unsufferable to pass, and I desire a very civi.11fellow in his roome, and if you will please spare me more I should be very glad , and then the men might have more liberty with safety. 752. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annamaboe, 24 Aug. 1694 Yours of the 22d instant I have received. Slaves wha t offers here we buy, but when they can have more on board, they will not offer them Lous. Corne the Mina peop le buyes soc much, that makes them they care not how little they bring us, because of them they have gold, and as they tell me above 2a the chest. [ shall endeavo ur to gctt the quantity ordered, ifl can bring them to comply at la 6ta. If you have any blue plaines I desire them if never soe few, either good or damaged if rated accordin[g] ly. Sayes I cannot put off one, they will not take them at 1oz. 753. Edward Searle Charles Fort. Annam aboe, 27 Aug. 1694 This is only to desire to be advised if I may sell English carpetts for sixteen a beady, havcing money here for some and cannot sell them for more, the Negroes saying they can have them soc on you. 754. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annamaboe , 29 Aug . 1694 Yours of this date I have just received. Mr Cooper has about six chest come, Mr Finck thirty , & myself sixty, which is what we have as yett taken in. If any fine sletias I desire some. 755. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annamaboe , 4 Sept. L694 According Lo your orders have shipped on board the Guinea Galley sixty chests come , and by the great canoe sent twenty chests with seven slaves , vizt four men three women, on accompt of the Royall African Company of England. The carriages for Lhe gunn are all to wide , I desire a carpenter to :fitt them . The bricklayer tells me he shall wanl one thousand of bricks to repaire the Fort , I desire a canoe may be returned with as many as they can bring. One spur is finished, but have noe barrs or staples to fasten the gate withall. I desire four quarters for joyce for the seconds roome, fourteen foot long & seaven inches deep, with a quarter cask tarras, and that will be the first Lhing repaired, because it wiU not beare the gunns that stand on it to be fired till it i done. I desire alsoe what men you can spare me , and a surgeon, we being daily att charge sending for the Dutch Doctor. If any blue pautkeys I desire two or three hundred. I desire you will please to order how I shall send the ballance of my accompts and in two or three dayes shall send them . Mr Cooper desires the same likewise . 756. Edward Searle Charles Fort , Annamaboe, 7 Sept. 1694 Yours of yesterdays date I have received. If had the timber desired for the seconds roome we could doe that without your ca1penter. According to your orders by this canoe goes my accompt & ballance, being seven marke 13 angles & 8 taccoes, of which one marke 13 angles & 8 taccoes era era gold, alsoe twenty chests come, all on the accompt of the Royall African Company of England. Mr Cooper & Mr Pincks gold is likewi e in the che t. 104 I desire the dore & window cases as soon as possible, with hook , barr & staples convenient, or that you will order me to have the ironworke made here by the Blacks, for we have neither gates nor dores that we can fasten as they should be, which if we should have occasion may finde the want of it. The prison doore & window I desi.re may be very good timber, & strong barrs putt in them. Come now they have done worke I finde very plenty. I have taken almost three hundred chests besides what I have alreddy delivered, and have not yett forbidd them bringing in, soe that if you please to have any more purchased now will be the time for this yeare. 757 . Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annamaboe, 18 Sept. 1694 Yours of yesterdayes date by the carpenter I have received, with what necessaries you sent, and according your orders have returned the carpenter by the great canoe. What good his comeing downe has done is that now he is able to satisfie you what we are in want of, which is much better to be done here than alt Cabo Corso, for what they rnake there doe not fitt the place they are made for. I desire it may be done out of band. He can satisfi.e you how badly we are provided. I desire an iron barr for the prison doore, three more large square staples, & as many hooks for wooden barrs. I desire on accompt of the Royall Company three or four bales of blue plaines, two bales of English woollen carpetts, & one case of half blue long cloths to be sent tomorrow. I shall gett the come ordered as soon as possible. PS. The Guiney Gally, Capt. Piles, is in sight of this place. By the great canoe have sent twenty five chests come. Just now is brought to me money for knives & 4 lb basons, which I desire may be sent in the morning early, with the goods above desired, one caske knives & one hundred basons. The seas running high the canoemen will not goe, which is the reason I send this by land to desire the goods in another canoe. 758. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annamaboe, 20 Sept. 1694 Yours of yesterdays date with the goods sent by the great canoe I have received, & per returne of her have sent twenty five chests of come. 759. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annamaboe, 2 1 Sept. 1694 According to yours of yesterdays date by a 5 hand canoe goes Mr Goreing .105 The great canoe was gone before I received yours. Mr Goreing goeing from me forces rne to desire John Browne to be removed, & a carefull honest man in his roorne . I shall not trouble you any further, for I am ashamed that I must soe farr, but Mr Goreing being an eyewitnesse to all his actions can give you a full accompt of him. To trust him with the care of the Fort I dare not. 760. Thomas Buckeridge 106 Annimaboe, 29 Sept. 1694 I understand that the money dew from the Fanteene factorys 107 for ballance of there accompts will amount to 18 or 20 rnark, wherefore being to come by land desire to know how the same shall be dispo sed on. 761.

The bricklayers have not a trowell to lay tarries with, soe I desier one per bearer and, a handsaw for the carpe nter. [PS] I have likewise sent 20 chest of come. 763. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Ann.imaboe [ 4] Oct. 109 1694 According to order with Mr Thomas Buckeridge I have inventored all the Royall Companey concerns in this Forte , which inventorey will be delivered you by him by the great cannoe . Yesterday whent the gold dew from the three factorys, likewi e twenty cheast of corne and two women slaves from me, the slaves received from Mr Cooper.

Tdesierd some blew plaines, if you have any desier two or three bailes the first opportunity. The Doctor and Serjeant both I ayes on the ground for want of cotts, I desier you will be pleased to spare two for the use of the Castle. If they are ready made the bearer will take care to have them brought by land. [PS] I have bin indisposed or should have sent my accompt, but in a day or two shall send them. 765. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annimaboe, 10 Oct. 1694 This onely to desire nails for the repaire of the fort. The carpenter tells me the least he shal I want is four thousand. The bearer have nails of the sorte wee want, which I desire as at the foot hereof. of the largest sorte 1000 of the m.idling sorte 2000 of smaller sorte 1000 766. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annimaboe, 12 Oct. 1694 This accompaneys my September accompts. The goods disposed of for [come] came not to soe maney cheast as was put into inventory , as by my accompts appears. At the end of this month shall charge aH I have, which is one hundred cheas t, deducting onely what I have delivered this month. The case of Guiney cloutes I received the 8th instant contains noe more then one hundred and thirty eaigh te. By the bearer I have sent OJoz 13a gold in exchange of what you returned me for bad money. The gold for my ballance I weighed hear to Mr Buckeridge, and afterwarde a parte by itselfe, 4a which I putt in to make weight, which 1thought had bin sufficient for soe small a summ, but sence I must send six angles more I .likewise have sent it accordi ng to your order. You noe [= know] very well I have noe trade from the up countrys, 110 soe I sec I shall not contenue this I have without losse to my selfe. The 3 musketts wanting that [ms. 'the'] l sent to the armorer to mend, which l desier may be returned with the others formerly send upp. rdesier to be advised what Serjant Clemmets pay is & Nathanell Howard, and from what time I must pay them. [PS] Thomas Saile [var. 'Seale'] ayes he is in debt noe more then la 6ta. He payd 4a 3ta the day before he was sent heather , which wa for a cheast , soe have sent you noe more then la 6ta for him and 2a 3ta for Voss Jackson, with 2 oz 3a to come per bearer. My ballance is in all 2oz 6a 9ta. 767. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annimaboe, 16 Oct. 1694 Yours of yeasterdayes date I have received. The reason their wa more come in the inventorey then in the accompts was that wee mist cast [= miscast] the goods disposed on and in makeing up my accompts I found the error. The Guiney cloutes I opened my selfe, soe can give noe other certificate then my owne. This is to advise you that our hall is open. Wee found another small girder of sixteen foot long decayed, that it will hardly beare its own waite [=weight]. The carpenter desier[s] either Bastien or the white carpenter to assist him for foure or five days to gett upp the gurders and to fitt in the joyces. A gurder I found heare, one which was left in Mr Cross's time. If you please to send Bastian by land, he may retume by Jand againe a Saterday night. If wee have not some other assistance our hall will be long open, and if raines should happen wee hall receive much damage, our warehouse being underneath. I de ier tenn good strong men slaves for two or three dayes. Free people are not used to uch woorke, and without help wee cannot gett up the gurders. I desier tomorrow the stores as at the foot hereof, which without wee cannot goe forward with our woorke. Our Gunner being desirous to goe to Cape Coa t Castle this day to deliver his discharge of you, he haveing 1.o t the use of both his armes, is desireous to be di charged of hi place and to remaine hear till the shipp is ready to saile, 111 soe by the first opportunity I clesier a carefull honest man to supply his place. 30 deal boards, of which 6 sleate [ = slit] 3 hogsheads tarries I cask of tarr to mix with the picth [= pitch] . ditto picth to stop the spoutes of the tanck 800 or 1000 bricks 2 iron sbovells for the bricklayers use PS. Thomas Saile sayes still he payed 4a 3ta. As for what trusted the Cabbo heers of Arnersa, was in goods, for which when the Factorie wa inventoried was made disposed of, therefore I charged in my accompt of charges. When you send for more shells the Company will have credit for it according. I desier the bearer with the slaves desiered may be sent by land this night. 768. Edward Searle Annimaboe, 19 Oct. 1694 Withowt twenty or thirty deale boards wee cannot cover the hall or goe any further in our woork. Desi er that may have them in the morning earley. I hope the tarries may doe. The Forte is so farr runn to ruine that there is not a free place about it but what is damaged. Tomorrow shall inlarge. 769. Edward Searle Charles Fort, Annimaboe, 20 Oct. 1694 19thYours of the 171\ and this date I have received, and likewise the brick s and tarries &ca by the great cannoe, which shall be husband[ed] as well as possible. One of the 3 handed cannoes was staved in fecthing the bricks ashoore . I perceive you thought I wrote for boards , & [of] those remaining hear which the carpenter brought down, tweenty five used for spoute s for the tanck, which are set togeather, but [have] not put up the rest except two to cover the seconds roome. The old spoutes are pulled to peaces, what are good shall help to cover the hall but all will not doe. It is pitty to put boards that will not [en]dure a yeare over such good timber as is now on the hall. The garders are up and the joyce s are layde, soe according to your order I have returned Bastion and all the slaves excep t 3 which wee cannot be without them, and as soon as possib le shall return them all. The old boards about the Forte will not cover our woork, soe humble desire the boards a Munday morning, that the Forte may be repaired at once as it should be, and then it will not want [for] maney years. If not, to put such rotten boards as wee shall be forced to doe will spend the lime and tarries to noe purpose. The roome over the cookroome must likewise be taken up to put in two large joyces which are heare for that purpose, wee hardly dare walk on it. Besides a great maney other places will want boards, to teadious to trouble you, which if I have necessaries the Forte shall be repaired as it ought to be, but if they are not to be had I hope I shall not be blamed heareafter. The carpenter and bricklayers doe not set any time. I told them that you wrote and asked them in what time they judged it would be done, all they told me it would be at the end of the next month, but I will forward them as much as possible. If you cannot possible spare soe maney boards pray send what you can, wee must make the best shift wee can to cover the cookroome. I hope you will never have any lamer accompts from me and shall esteeme my knowledge never the worse for the last. [PS] Wee cannot cover the hall withowt more boards. Basteyn can tell you what condition all things are in. 770.

The contents of your letter much surprized me, that he should not have made knowne his resolution before now, knowing removalls cannot be made at an houres warneing. 122 I hope to effect my bussiness att Winneybah time enough to be att Accra at inventoring.

John Rootsey Annomaboe, 2 March J694/5 Yesterday came downe here an interloper, a Briganteene , who as I am told bythe Blacks offers 4a per che t for come, soe fear shall gett none whilst he is here. Bonyshee & Humphry both promissed me some on Munday next, on the latterI depend but the other I fear will not comply with his word. I can make noeaccompt for this last month, haveing taken but verry little money. I have here sixwomen slaves, five of them being bought by William Cooper,125 the other by myselfe. PS. I have forst the above mentioned interlooper out of road by firing 2 shott atthim, but that will not fright him quite away, he now la[yJing out of shot ofthe Castle. 790. John Rootsey Annimaboe, 13 March 1694/5 Yesterday Bonnishee informed me that the Dutch had been tampering with theCuranteer and sent them severall bendys gold and some cases Liquorto sidewith them against Taggee. 126 The Curanteers have not only refused their mony&ca but have with the Braffoe's I27 made a palaver that the Dutch or Minacanoes for future shall not be upplyed with come, or any sent to the Castle .They have al o opened the way that the people may bring their come to ourCastle, for whkh they demand of roe two cases spirrits, for which must waiteyour orders. I hope now to supply you with come enough. I have sent up five pieces slaves irons which are broake, and desire that the bomboy may be ordered to send others in their roome, with soome spare rivetts. PS. By this canoe have sent 10 chest corne. Annamaboe, 15 March 1694/5791. John Rootsey The Cabbosheers told me this morning that they canot send their people to assist Taggee for want of powder and desire you will supply them, for the payment of which they will give gold pawne. They alsoe expect youle give them some for a dashe before they goe, which as they say wiJJbe on Sunday next, I understand they designe by the way of Saboe.128 Tho they talkc soc much of going I as much doubt it, by reason they say Taggee has given them nothing, but if you please to send downe powder it will be ready here for them or what other use you please to order it. 792. John Rootsey Annamaboe, 19 March 1694/5 According to your desire have sent my five hand canoe and am glad I have her to serve you. The Blacks at Cormantyne have deserted the towne that lyed about the Castle and say noe blacks shall come in nor noe Dutch men come out of the Castle. This morning came downe one of their [i.e. Dutch) ships, as I suppose landed their Cruefe. 793. John Rootsey Annamaboe, 22 March 1694/5 I understand you have gott the two great canoes from the Dutch againe, 129 therfore desire you') be so kind to order mine downe againe, & if any tyme you want, she shall be at your service. 794. John Rootsey Annamaboe, 3 April 1695 With this you'! receive my accompts for the last two months, by which you'l see 1 have had a verry bad trade. I wish the next two months may have better, but I much doubt it, by reason the people are all gome to the warrs.130 If must buy any more come desire you'l renue your order, the last being near compleated, wherein you gave me power to give two angles a chest, and its not easely procured at that rate. I have sent per the bearer one ounce gold, which stopt from Serjeant Clements in part of 2 months sallary advanced him in England, the rest he will pay the next pay day. He complains that he has been short paid 2a 21/2ta each pay day since his arrivall, he haveing received but 1oz 8a lO.ta & his due is 1oz 12a lta, which is 2 months att £40 per anno. 13 1 795. John Rootsey Annamaboe , 8 April 1695 By the bearer have sent my accompts for February & March & the ballance , which is 4oz 3.ta. The Curenteers demand of me 1oz 8a for thre months pay, if you allow of it please to order it & it shall be paid. 796. John Rootsey Annemaboe , 11 April l 695 This come to acquaint you of Mr WiJiam Gudges death, at the hour of 7 last night. I am going [i.e. to Anashan] to see him intered, and shall take care to see the warehouse secur'd and Mr Gudge owne goods till receive orders from you. 797. John Rootsey Annamaboe, 12 April 1695 After I had seen MrGudge inter'd, seal'd the warehouse dore, & have herewith sent the key. I draw'd out of one of the quarter casks four flagons rum to give the Cabbosheers , the Blacks that fired, and the grave diggers . I have sent an accompt of his cloathes &ca. I found noe more gold then 12a 4ta, which I weigh 'd & seal'd up, our Serjeant and Thomas Farmer being present, and have sent it by the bearer with a fuzee & silver headed cane, which would not goe into his chist. Mr Gudge sold me a woman slave for 'ix peaz , the money is still due to him, except 10a which he is indepted to me, being mony lent him when he first took possestion of Annishan Factory . What I have done is without order, but I hope you'l not disaprove of it. 132 PS. I took 1 sheet out of the warehouse to bury him in. The 2 Cabbosheers that used to supply me with come [have been with me this morning , and say they will have 3a per chest, or else they will not bring come in, because they tell me can make 4a per chest & seJl itt per the taccoe to the Cabo Corso people. If you allow of that price please to advise. I have had a long palaver with them about their asking so extravagant a rate but it signifies little, they knowing your necessity and they will have their own price and what goods they please . 798. John Rootsey Annamaboe , 15 April 1695 This comes to acquaint you that I canot gett come , not soe much as will feed the slaves here, haveing already feed them with English peese three days , which I bought of Mr Salmon, 133 therfore d ire you will be pleased to end for them. Three of the women have been sick of the flux, which hath made them verry thinn. If you please to order me to give 3 angles per chest, I bcleive can gett 'to'] some small quantity more (but not much). Bonny shee tells me that [ms. those men that have come are gone to the camp, but my opinion is they have sold most of their come, and will want them selves if the rain doth come not suddenly to produce their other sort of provitions.134 I waite your orders. PS. I desire to know if you have any slaves that arc runn away. I hear of an Arda slave taken up about Arnmessa and have sent for him. 799. John Rootse y Annamaboe, 16 April 1695 Yours by Cabbosheer Hansicoe have received, and according to your order will assist him in the palavra for come as much as I can, and when we have done what we can, the Cabbosheers of this towne have not any come but what they buy for themselves, except one man who demands 3a per chest, who is at his crooroe in the country, but have sent for him, that Hansicoe may ask his reason why he demands so extravaga nt a rate. l hartily wish could supply you, 1 assure you l have used my endeavours, and could I attaine them it would be to my reputation. You will receive by this canoe 9 women and 2 men slaves, 5 of which bought by Mr Cooper and the rest by me, as apears by my last accompt. 800. John Rootsey Annamaboe, 18 April 1695 Here are some traders come downe with money.135 They want blue per.petuanoes, sheetts and powder, therfore desire you'l please to send of each sort to this factory, as soone as this comes to hand, the people now staying for them. I des ire may have them blue perpetuano es out of Annishan Factory. PS. Hansicoc has been verry sick but is now better. 801. John Rootsey Annamaboe, 21 April 1695 This is to acquaint you that have received from on board the Guiney Galley three hundred and ninety sheets. Annim aboe, 23 April 1695802. John Roo tsey With this have sent two men & one boy slaves, the boy at 1oz 4a. The man slave which I wrote you of that was taken up about Amessa have sent for, and as soon as the messenger came into the towne he (I beleive) was conveyed away, tho they say he made his escape . The place where he was taken up is a days joumy to leaward of this. I suppose Hensicoe told you of 20 chests, JOof great & 10 small come , 136 which I was promised should be brought in next Thursday at 3a per chest, soe desire you order I shall take it or not. PS. I have taken all the spirritts, being 8 cases, & the blue perpetuanoes from Annishan, being 27., & desire you'l be pleased to sent me 200 blue perpetuanoes more. 803. John Rootsey Annamaboe, 24 Aprill 1695 Three of the 4 women slaves you retum'd belong to Mr William Cooper, which I have sent downe to him. 137 Mr Searle told me when I received any slaves from Agga it was to secure them, this being a garrison , and I am not oblig'd to make them good if not merchandable. l presume Mr Cooper would have taken it verry ill of me if I had told him (when he sent them) they were not merchandable, of which you are the only judges. Besides the slaves were sent here before Mr Searle left the place, which cann prove by Mr Coopers notes to him, and he did not deliver command of the factory to me till he tooke his leave at the gates, so that damage lies rather more on him then me . I give you a more particular accompt because Mr Searle told our Doctor that since they were left in my custody, [I] was oblig'd to macke them good, but that in my judgment is an error. Had they all died I presume it is on the Companys accompt & not mine . In the roome of the slaves you retum 'd belonging to me have sent another woman that I bought of Mr Gudge, because I would not be at the trouble of altring my accompts , haveing already ntred them in my books. I hope Mr Cooper will do the like without any further trouble, haveing also given him credit in my accompts for five women . I received by the canoe one hundred perpetuanoes. Just as the canoe came to shoare the seas run so high that fill'd her with water and the perpetuanoes were verry wett. I have opened & dried them all, so hope they'l sell for not less . We want a canoe for this place verry much, oe de ire your order whether shall charge this five hand canoe that I have to the Company in my next accompt at 3oz 4a, being less then he cost me, she being employed in the Companys service altogether. Mr Searle told me alsoe that you allowe of a canoe for this place, which is the reason I mention it, soe hope you'l grant it. 804. John Rootsey Annamaboe, 29 April 1695 The enclosed I broke open (unawares), thinking it had been for me, which en-or I hope you'! excuse. 138 The man that was employed to cutt the 20 sticks wood which lately was sent from Annashan hath been with me severall tymes for his money. He demanded 5 angles, but have brought him to four, which if you' l please to order will pay. I have taken in yet butt 5 chests come, which I thinck is too little to send you by the five hand canoe. Tomorrow I expect the other 15 chests which I write you is promissed. 805. John Rootsey Annamaboe , 1 May 1695 According to your orders have sent five chest come in a two hand canoe. I doubt the man that promised will not be so good as his word to bring in small come. I am verry lame with the gout in my right hand, and what herein you find amiss please to excuse. PS. Please to send per first opportunity a baile blue pautkies. 806. John Rootsey Annimaboe, 27 May 1695 According to your orders have removed all the goods of Annishan factory, & desire you wiU be pleased to send me the inventory that was taken when Mr Gudge first went there, that may know what damage is sett on them. Most of the tallow which came from thence is very bad, the casks standing soe long on one head that they are rotten & some of them much eaten by the ratts. I was forsed to be att a great expence when the Cufferoes were routed, 139 the town people breinging tne between 2 & 300 heads (as near as I can jud ge), & with abundance of alacrity told me they fought not only for their one [ = own] intrest but ours alsoe , soe hope you'l allow me to charge in my accompt for it. Some days since the Fanteniers pinjard some of the Saboe people on Little Tagee 140 for a Fanteen man which he keeps off. The Saboers did the like on the Cape Coast people, & [the latter] sent them here to redeem them, & as one of them was comeing by our Castle [she] run in for refuge, on which the Cabbosheers came all in & demanded her but I peacefied them & have sent the woman by the bearer. They desire you' I please to order Taggee to deliver him in their case. [PS] One of the musketts which was att Annishan Captain Cofee owns, soe left itt because would have noe trouble with him when removed the things. 807. John Rootsey Annimaboe, 28 May 1695 This morning stood into our road a large shipp which showed both Dutch &English collors & put the interloper into a consternation, judgeing her to be aFrench man of warr, on which he came under our Castle & desired protection.The merchant of her is come on shoar & with him two trunks & a deske. What isin them I know not, but pursuant to your orders sha.11secure both him & them tillhear from you. I doe belivc the shipp to be a Dutch interloper. 808. John Rootsey Annamaboe, 18 June 1695 I have sent one of our gunns, which by accident the gunner broake the primingirons in its vent. Its one of comer guns, which on occasion must clear the frontpart of the Fort, and we have no other gunn small enough to put in its place.Have also sent up nine musquetts which are unservicab le, and desire they mayeither be refitted or exchang'd. I have sent Serjeant Clements with them, hedesireing it, haveing a litle business at Cabo Corso Castle as he says, that he mayforward the smith to dispatch them. We want severall other things for the fortsuse which have undermentioned. I shall observe your orders to suply EdwardBarter with what goods he wants, he hath already had three chests sheets. 141 Least I should want, I desire youl please to send per the canoe six chests sheets,& when the Serjeant retumes 4 quarther cask rum for to pay the danceingcustome & for factory use. I have been verry much indisposed with the gout bothin feet & hands. I am not yet quite recove red; which you may see by myhandwriting, thats the reason have not sent my accompts for Aprill & May; buthope you shall suddanly have them. PS. Belts for the soldiers, flints, hooks, hinges, staples & hasps for the windows,tarras for the upcr floor, 2 quire cartridge paper, 200 spungc nails, spunge headsfaulk[on] in size, 2 scains match, t[h]red, canva[s] to make baggs, a worme toclear small arms. 809. John Rootsey Annamaboe, 2 1 June 1695 I have sent in two 2 hand canoes seventy two blue perpctuanoess. The 5 handcanoe is alt Cabo Corso Castle with the Serjeant. I desire when she returns, you'!please to send in her & these two canoes ten chests sheets. If it had not rain'd you would have received the perpetuanoes by day lig[h]t. PS. The perpetua noes are putt up into six white blanketts. 810. John Rootsey Annamaboe, 4 July 1695 I have sent two of my Aprill & May accompts, being what could finish. I supose you arc not unsensab le of my indi sposition, first the gout & now a fcavour & ague, attend ed with a verry sharp tumor in my rig[h]t eye, which alsoe is the reason you have not my June accompts. If could sett to make them you may be assured should have them now and the ballance, which I supose would be 4 marques att leas t. I have sold all the blue perpetuanoes that are good, and some red. I desire you' l please Lo send me some more red perpetua noes, sheets, and a baile of blue pautk.ics by Mr Ronans boy Hector. 142 When he returnes will send a women slave in the roome of that you return 'd. The other three belong'd to Mr Cooper, which I sent him, and he promi sed to send others for them. 811. Richard Brigham Annamaboe, 9 July 1695 Att our Mr Rootseys request, I presume to write to informe your worships that he did not forgett stopping the serjeants arrears but has it already in his hands, & design'd to have sent it with [h]is last accompts, had not indisposition soe totally subverted all his facu ltys as scarce to remember anything when he was forced to write last. I hope now the violence both of hi s tartian [= tertian] ague 143 & feaver & the deplun [=deplume], 144 which has been so troublesome in his eyes as since his last writing to your worships to quite deprive him of his sight, is gone of & doubt not God willing in a wcaks time may recover. Our garrison have been every man indisposed with feavour except myselfe & Thomas Seale. 812. John Rootsey Anoamaboe , 'J5 July J695 I desire you'l please to send by returne of this canoe two bailes red per.petuanoes, & a baile of green. 813. John Rootsey Annamaboe, 18 July 1695 The messe nger you sent about the come palaver [I] have assisted to my utmost, & have made the Cabbo sheers promi se to bring in their corn at 2a per chests. They proposed that the towne Cabboshees should have 2a 4ta per chests, & I should buy of the boores 145 as cheap as 1could, by which meanes all the com in the country would belong to them . Bonyshee demands on Taggee accompts, which I formerly advised you of, 146 nine ounces gold in saye & iron, & one case of spirritts. The bearer will give you a more particuler accompt per word of mouth. 814.

John Rootsey Annamaboe , 29 July 1695 I have sent the 5 hand canoe with ten che ts corn. The reason of my now sending of her is [I] have the Arcany' at present weighing mony for red perpetuanoes, they will buy no more green at present , because they say have not old what they bought the last time they came downe, 147 therfore desire you'l plea e to send me three bailes of red perpetuanoes by the canoe as soon as she can be dispatcht. Also plea e to send me some corrall & knives. I have no more to add but that if you find anything herein irregular impute it to the noyes [= noise] of the traders, & excuse [me]. PS. Please send a chest for Mr Brownes 14 and my ballance of June & July. I have near 8mk & I beleive he ha more. 816. John Rootsey Annamaboe, 30 July 1695 This minute Bonnishee is goeing (as I am informed) to Connantyne, where he meets hi brother Cabbosheers and the Generall of the Mina, I believe rogues all together. I t[h]ought it my duty to lett you know it, and that the Generali came downe yesterday in the shipp that past by this place (privately). PS. The Mina people have paid the Cabbosheers seven says and two cases come brandy (ye terday) to be admitted to buy come . 817. William Ronan 149 Annamaboe, 2 Aug. 1695 I expect this day to bind the Cabbosheers of this country by fiteshees to be true to our interest and to stand by the King of Aguaffo. His trealing to lake the Dutch forts and stop all trade from them has made them [ = the Dutch] mad & putt them upon takeing these people off,150 bul hope they will miss their aime. The Kings men being urgent to goe away, & that you thincke good may lett them have the two barrell powder, since it is to give his friends thancks. I hear there is another messenger from the Mina come to Saboe last night. I exept (= expect) the Kings brother here at the takeing the fitechees, and then know his arrant [=e rrand]. Tomorrow hope to see you. 818. Willam Ronan Annamaboe, 2 Aug. 1695 Since my last came downe a messenger from the King of Saboe, intrcating me to waite for the King, who will dye [sic], 151 & Captain Ahen of Fatue (ms. 'Tatue '], 152 who will be here tomorrow in company of the Saboers. Betwixt the later and the Fanteners I find there's some grudge, 153 which hope hapily to accomodate, with all other affairs here, haveing now the Captain of Abra, 154 Quomona 155 & old Bonnyshee, on whom depends the whole mannagement of this country, and who riadey [= ready] promise to do anything for our nation. The Dutch contrive ing to ruine the King of Aguaffo, have offered them considerabily to stand neuter, but they refused it, and as soon as they heard of my being there, came away from them. The Copeman of the Mina with Ackim 156 are still at Cormanteen, the latter rmay chance [to] trapan tomorrow. The Generali hath promised the King of Saboe to send him the Copeman of Morea for a pawne, if he would send his two sons for a pledge to stand neuter, but that King I hope is a better fri[e]nd to us_ L57 They tell the Natives they have Cabes Terra & Danckaras to deale with the King of Agua:ffo, 158 but I realy believe the intrest they are makeing is to divert them from sideing with the King of Aguaffo from takeing their Forts . However if it should be true, these people ressolving to stand by the King of Aguaffo will discouradge the Danckaras & all others from making any more wan-s this way. Pray send me another flask brandy , & two or 3 bootles of wine; here is not a drap left, & were it not by good chance that Mr Rootsey had soome rumm, know not what I should have done . 819. William Ronan Annamaboe , 3 Aug. 1695 I have this morning ended the palaver, all the Coranteer & Cabbosheers haveing taken fitechees to content. I wayt only for the Fetuers and Saboers, tho have already done their bussiness, however if they come will be so much the better. I hope now & upon good grounds we need not any longer stand in fear of our neigbours indeavours. 159 I t[h]ought conveinent as well to encouradge the trade here, being much importuned thereunto, as well as in consideration of iron, tallow & b[l]anquetts, I say the great quantity of each sort we have by us, to lo[w]er the first at 20 per bendy, the 2(nd] att 3., the 3d at 3a each. If you think good of it pray give the factors here the needfull orders, & send Mr Browne iron as soon as possible. On sight hereof de ire you to send about 50 or 60 silk longees & as many single painted carpetts, & charge this factory with them. If they come in times l' shall ki s yom hands thi night, being quite tired with palaver . 820. John Rootsey Annamaboe, 6 Aug. 1695 Please to end three bailes sayes, & two hundred iron barrs. 821. John Root ey Annarnaboe, 7 Aug. 1695 Please to send by the 5 hand canoe (which have sent with come to the Steward) two hundred weight of smalle t bra s panns , and two bailes of English woolen carpetts. PS.

John Rootscy Annamabo e, 27 Oct. 1695 The Copeman of Connantyne will not venture himself at Annamaboe, by reason of some affronts he hath given the blacks, and it is a great wonder that he would trust his second here. I thought fit to secure his second because was shure he would not come. The gentleman now in my custody shall receive siveJJ [= civil] entertainment, tho am told by the blackes that came from the Mina last neight that our [ms.

He says he will not come againe into the Castle and if he be as good as his word it will be both for the good of the Company and our selve that live here. Our white men and the Companys slaves particularly have been abused and beaten by the blacks severall times. I bare it all on accompt of the war, 180 or els would have some of them in irons ere this time , and if it were not for the 2 factorys, 181 would immediately serve them the same as Mr Grigory did. 182 If it were not for those reasons noe man could bare the affronts which l have had, but must pass all by, and waite with patience for better times. PS.

I am sure he deserves that and more . J have had one of the Companys slave run away, an [ms. 'and'] Arda woman, one of the 10 which have charged in my accompts . She cannot speak this countrey language, nor doth he know the countrey , therefore am ure ' he must be stole or privately keept by some of the townes people. I have u ed my endeavours with them to gett her againe, but all is in vaine , for they doe what they please, because they are and think dare not be called to an accompt for them. I shall take care to be so wise a not to neglect the Companys bussiness, all false[hoods] as what the blacks ha informed you, shall not trouble me, knowing what sort of people they are in this place. I shall follow your orders as to Captain Quo. A it has been alwayes my endeavour to live peaceably among t the natives, soe you shall not find me only to promote it, but to continue it if it lies in my power. I have not else to add but beg your excuse for my bad scrib]jng, haveing the gout in my right thumb, that I cannot hold a pen fast. 860.

He promiseth to procure you a great quantity with all speed that can. It will be tomorrow or next day ere he can resolve upon the time they' ! be ready, when shall further advise. 863. John Browne Annamaboe, 22 April 1697 This is to advise you that Bonnyshee tells me that his people are still busied in weeding and planting of come, soe that it will be 20 or fifteen dayes at soonest, ere he can sett them to digg shell. Others tell me this is not really the cause of their want, but that their is difference between Bonnyshee and one Quashee at Amersa, 188 who has been hitherto concerned, soe it is like there can be none procured till the disputes are ended. Bonnyshee alledges he [ = Quashee Jhas no right, and wants to engross them all into his own hands. 864. John Browne Annamaboe, 24 April 1697 I have yours of the 24 instant, and shall be as pre ssing as I can upon Bonnyshee for to sett his people to digg shells.

If their night watches are not kept strongly they designe to surprize them suddenly, they haveing now the advantage of the moon shine for almost the whole night together. 194 PS.

He hath already so lessened his power by sundry occations, he sayes, to his charge of a secrett underhand corresponda nce he hath kept with Little Taggee, for advancing that intrest and carrying on of warr, that the country in generall are much insenced against him, and doe but little notice or regard him, the consequence whereof, he is very apprehensive to be dangerous,202 and suspects so mightily the ill treatment he is likely to meet with, through the means of the Captain [of] Abra, that he begins to studdy new methods to regain his creditt amongst the people, and to save himself from being quite outplaced. He frequently tell them in his publick pallavers that since the quarrel! Little Taggee hath undertaken is inconsistant with the well fare and constitution of this country, he therefore disowns and avoues never to be concerned therein, and taking notice that a great many of his people harbour jealous ies to the contrary, and that upon accompt of his being related to Little Taggee, by consaring a sister of his, itt is not to be expected but that he will privately favour his intrest so far as he can, but to put an end to this suspition he hath turned her from him [ms.

I have likewise taken what care I can to secure Agga Factory, and the Royall Companyes goods there.

I have hired this canoe to carry Finnee up with the Braffoes man, the Braffoe desireing it, for fear he might be panyard in goeing near Mowree by land.

I have asked his leave to come up to the Doctor, and he will not grant me, so I humbly begg that your Worshipps will grant me that favour, where I shall. relate the whole circumstance of the matter to your Worshipps, as you find it so proved, which being all, begging your Worshipps pardon for this my scribble. 902. Richard Sheldon Charles Fort Annamaboe, 25 April 1698 Thjs day I sent the Gunner up to have mshand drest, which I cut in my owne defence, as the inclosed will make appeare. PS. r am informed by the Blacks that one white man has left Winneba and is gone to Apom, where he now continues.220 903. Kendall Hutson221 Annamaboe, 27 April 1698 This is a small accompt of what I heard since my ari vall here, that affter enquiry from severall of the Blacks could not find the Cabbosheers were anywayes designed against the Braffoe.222 This morning after the intreaty gott the Captain of the Towne in, and affter drinking a sneaker of punch with him, he arose of bis own accord and called me a ide to know what news from Cabo Corso. I answered a that there was no more then that the Gent lemen frowed him and the rest ackey, and ordered me lo be kind to hjm, and hope that he would be true to the Braffo &ca. He told me that the Braffoes heart and his were all as one. I told him that I had heard from Cabo Corso amongst the Black that there was some ill designe amongst them against the Braffoe, but if so they had better lett it alone. I find that the generous Coapman 223 has been feeing 224 of the Blacks to stand by him here, and that Mr Newman is a very great assistant to him for new out of the accompting house. 225 It is a thing I had without enquiery from the Se1jeant. I also gott out of Eggin last night that there was severall of the Fantiners gone already to a sist the Arcanyes, and that they was all for the same cau e save the Braffoe, so that I feare there is some ill in hand. The Cabbosheers are I feare guilty, by their lyness of coming to the fort. Worthy Sirs, this is what I thought my duty to advi e. PS. Since the sealing up of this the Captain of the interloper sent his mate ashore to me for protection. I sent him word I would do what I could , having but 2 gunns that would beare upon him, but if he wou ld end his gold on shore I would take care of itt. 904. Kendall Hutson Annamaboe, 28 April 1698 Afi'tera small conferrance with Peter Quashee last night, found that tis' too sure that the Blacks will have the Bra1foes head off, if they can , and that before the Dankeryes and Arcanyes fight if possible, that they may be all as one to assi 't the Arcanyes if they runn to their part . The Dutch, who seldome lye idle in such cases, has certainly a hand in this, for their Coapman of Cormantine had been up about a fortnight agoe at Quarnan. The Captain of Annarnaboe Bentifoes and Banbeiree226 as l am informed is both the Braffoes cozens, and informes him of all pallavers from this towne. At my first corning here the black seemed to be much for Mr Sheldon , but since his departure from hense I find that they doe but laugh at all his liberallityes which he bestowed on them, and that another man may be respected here as well as he.227 The Braffoes cozen i up with the Dankeryes already as I am informed. As yett there is ooe men of repute gone to assist the Arcanyes from those parts, save a few poore scoundrell doggs , not any Cabbo beers. They are certainly affraid of the Dankeryes , butt putt the best side outward. Wee are weakly manned here if should have occation. I had but one barrell and a halfe of powder from Mr Sheldon, being an in the fort. I have gott one quire of cartridge paper from Capt. Osborne228 by much adoe. Captain Hansicoe and Hector is just now come, and as yett not given their hands to the Cabbosheers, therefore cannot as yett give any accompt of what they will say to them. Here is just now a Dutch Company shipp engaged with the interloper that came downe yesterday. He has sent me a note ashore which I understand not, the which have returned by Peter Quashee, and desire him to send by word of mouth. PS. Pray send me a pen or two and the cartridges I wrote for. The Dutchman is comeing under our protections, which is but small. I wish he is not served like Towres by his men.229 905. Charles Salmon Charles Fort, Annamaboe, 6 May 1698 Yesterday affter you went to Cabo Corso Castle, 230 I went to Agga folowing your Worshipps orders , at which time Mr Sheldon went out here into the towne at Annamaboe, for at my corning back from Agga I missed him. Affter a short time he came into the fort, and at night I nott having any lodging provided, was goeing to Aggah to sleep, charging the Serjeant and the souldiers to keep a good watch, but Mr Sheldon growing very contentious, saying he was then Cheife of the fort, and unless he had the keys and other things usually delivered him, he would sleep in the towne, I told him he had no business in the towne, unless he was goeing to counsell some accomplices , to which he answered what a plague was that to me if he did? I replyed that I would prevent all unjust desines, and commanded the Serjeant to bring him in from the outward gate and imprison him. I have likewise information that he has been broaching some designe with the Cabbosheers, but what it is I cannott yett find out. Nevertheless I doe intend to send him up this morning to Cabo Corso, I being assured there will be no good come of his staying here. I shall make it my business to enquire into all pallavers and give your Worshipps an accompt of them. 906. Charles Salmon Annamaboe , 7 May 1698 Tomorrow God willing, I will send up two more coppyes of the inventory of Annamaboe, with what news I heard. The Blacks at Agga did a great dayes work yesterday, by which find that wh.ichI thought to have been a round bastian to prove a square one. A oone as the other is cleared I will send your Wor hipp á the figure and dementions of the ground plott. 907. Charles Salmon Annamaboe, 8 May 1698 Since my last to you by James Elliott, this morning the King of Sabboes man hath been here with a mesage from hi master, which is this: when the two Kings of Sabboe and Aguoffoe were at variance , your Worshipps did then compose that difference to a mutuall friendshipp,23 1 and now you have sent for him lately to as ist the Dankeryes, which he refused to doe, he finding now that you are displeased with him for it, in regard he sent you some palme wine, and you refused it, and ent it back to him againe, he still is resolved to assist the Arcanyes, and all his great reason is, that the gold which comes to the water side is called Arcany gold, not Dankery gold, the Arcanyes keeping their Captain[ ] at all places of trade along the Coast, which the Dankeryes doe not,232 nevertheless he will assist your Worshipps with anything his country affords, he having a greater regard for the English then for the Dutch. 908. Charles Salmon Annamaboe, 8 May 1698 These are to informe your Worshipps that the Blacks which went from this country with an intent to fight the King of Aguoffoe are all returned with silence.233 I am likewise informed that the Dankeryes and Arcanyes are not in any posture of joyrring battle, these late bone dayes234 being past. There are several! of the Dankeryes nmn to the Arcany , as the report is, for want of food. The King of Sabboe is likewise gone to the assistance of the Arcanyes, who I am told have twenty great gunns from Quamboe, which were taken from the Deans fort at Accra,235 and likewise some from Labordee,236 which were lost in a Negro sloope237 of the Companyes there.238 All affairs in this towne seeme to be very still and quiett. I doe intend this day to send a messenger to the Braffoe, to know how the affairs are carryed on at Fantine, and will then give your Worshipps an accompt of them . 909. Charles Salmon Annamaboe, 8 May 1698 Since my two former of this dayes date this bearer, the Braffos man, informed me that the Arcanyes are routed239 and fledd to the Aikims country.240 I therefore desire your speedy advice, what must be done if the Arcanyes shouJd fly here for security. 910. Charles Salmon Annamaboe, 10 May 1698 I have this day had intelligence that the Dankeryes have routed the A.rcanyes, it comes by a Black which came this morning from Abra, and that no man can tell what is become of the Captain of Quaman, his sword bearer and kettesall [ = kittysol]24 1 man being both come back, but know not what is become of their master.242 The Blacks this morning have proffered me two men slaves, and have confessed them to be Arcanyes. There is likewise a[t] Dorninees house243 an A.rcany man from the camp, wounded in the thigh by a shott, who confirmed that the Arcanyes are certainly routed. I humbly desire your Worshipps orders what to doe. PS. There are two white men gone to Quamon from Cormanteen. Your boy Jack was with me this morning, and is gone to Abra. I humbly desire that the irons have been sent may be returned . 911. Charles Salmon Annamaboe, 17 May 1698 I have just now received a message from the Braf:foe, who [w)ants two perpetuanoes, and desires your Worshipps to use what intrest you can in the Dankeryes a:ffaires to gett the Captain of Quamon to Cabo Corso Castle and keep him there untiU he sha.ll be brought to a fair complyance, on all accompts whatsoever.244 I understand that it is Dominyes mother 245 hath been desireing the Braffoe to make this pallaver for him. Since la t night that these two interlopers came into the roade, I have heard nothing of the slaves T had bargained for yesterday, which makes me think I shall purchase butt few, as long as they lye here. The Bratfoe desires your speedy answer. PS. I want two casks of rumme forts use. 912. Charles Salmon Annamaboe, 21 May 1698 By this canoe comes twenty chests of come, the canoe men being not willing to take in more, by reason the canoes bottome is bad. A for the Cabbosheer here they would not lett me rest, until I had paid their custom . They still seem to be in a consternation concerning the Dankeryes, altho' not all of them are soe, only those who I uppose have reason to fear a requiteall for their clandestine roagery. There are two particular men in this towne who privately tell me it will not be convenient that ever the Captain of Quamon be reduced246 to this country any more, in regard he will never leave his former projects, butt will undoubtedly be assisted and prompted by the Dutch to his former villanyes, which are like to those who sett him to work. ow these two mens advice is that instead of makeing a pallaver to gett this Captain of Quamon cleare, you make a pallaver to take his head off, and then the greate t enemie to the English intrest in Fantine will be past doeing any more hurt.247 I have ent to the Braffoe concerning come but have not yett had answer. PS. Tomorrow I will send Mr Browne the accompt he hath ordered &ca.248 913. Charles Salmon Annamaboe, 27 May 1698 By this bearer comes the inventoryes, and likewise Agga accompts for Aprill, which if itt is not according to method, I desire a speedy returne of itt, thatt this next week I may send up both itt and Annamaboe accompt together. As for gold there is none stiring, nor any other trade butt whatt these interlopers have, for which there is no remedy att present. The news that I hear is that the King of the Dankeryes hath sent word to the King of Sabboe thatt he will come and speak with him. The Cabbess country hath sent to the Bratfoe, to desire his aid in the makeing of peace with the Dankeryes, who are in great quantitys in their country, takeing what provitions they can find and plundering the people. I hear likewise that the King of Aguoffoe is threatned by the Dankeryes, for a breach of promise, 249 and thatt the Quamboes have desired the Dankeryes to assist them against the Aikims.250 As for the Captain of Quaman I hear noe talk concerning him. The Braffoe is very well & promiseth to send corne the first fair weather. I stand in great need of the iron work I last wrote for, having nothing to keep the windows fast or the raine out. I have gott the warehouse made as firme from leakes as the present occation requires, and now want some lime to stopp up a few cracks in the tarris above where the raine soaks through and rotts the timber work. If the smiths have nott made the short hooks for the windows Lett them be made butt 2 inches shank, 251 and the staples as narrow as possible, that the hooks may nott have two[= too] much play. I pray God send us a Companyes shipp with a recruit of tradesmen, for Annamaboe when strictly searched will find a greate deale of worke to be done. 914.

He intends to bring some slaves with him if he can purchase them, therefore I humbly desire that I may have some shakles and bolts sent dowoe, for I have but one pair in the factory. 918. Charles Salmon Annamaboe, 3 July 1698 The Braffoe is just now here at Annamaboe. Here is come with him the Chiefe Cabbosheer of the Cabbess Country. The occation of their coming hither is this: the Cabbess people, haveing made a contract with the Dancra's for a certaine sum.me of money not to molest their country, have already paid the Dancra's some of their money, and because the Dancra's wait for the rest, and the Cabbess people being at present unfurnished with goods, therefore this Cabbosheer is come on purpose in behalfe of his country, to desire your Worshipps to tnist him with the vallue of a hundred bendys in such goods as he shall want, but if you cannot doe itt then to trust him with the vallue of fifty bendy's. The Braffoe is come on purpose with him, being his cozen, to desire your Worshipps complyance to this proposal!. He [the Caboceer of Cabess] hath brought with him for pawns his owne sone and his cozen that is his heir,256 and will likewise bring Quominah, Quashees sone,257 and they shall be sent to Caho Corso Castle, and he sayes that as scone as the Dancra 's are gone the trade will open all his part of the country, and he shall be able to pay you in short time, with what slaves you shall think fitt, there being now a great many in the country which he can procure, his croome tyeing just in the center of trade for the Arcany's, Dancras, Akims or any of the up country people, and this the Braffoe confirmes, and likewise that it lyes in his power to stopp all trade that comes into the Fantine country . This Cabbosheer tells me he would have been at Caho Corsoe, but there are people there that sould a great many of his country men, when they went there for shelter in Mr Humphreys tirne,258 but he says that was not your fault, if you please to do him this great kindness he will always keepe friendshipp and good correspondence with the English, and if you doe not think his former pawns suffitient, he will pawne himself, and the Bra:ffoe shall keep him, which the Bra:ffoe hath promised to doe, and desires your W orshipps speedy answer to this pallaver, in regard he hath an intent to make a firrne friendship between the English and Cabbess country, and says that now is the time to doe this. 919. Charle Salmon Annamaboe, 6 July 1698 The Bra1foe is still here, and desires your Worshipp to trust him with two mark worth of perpetuanoes which he now wants, and in regard it will be troublesome to have them from Cabo Corso Castle he de ires to have them from hence. As for the 18 chests of come his man brought you my receipt for, he expects more then 2a per chest, saying you promised him more. The Braffoes man tells me that if I wrote to desire your presence you would come, but here is noe occation for soe great a trouble, besides I am soe lame that I cannott stirr off my bedd to the hammock without crutches, and then with a great deale of paine.
