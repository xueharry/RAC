VII EGYA Egya ('Agga') is I km east of Anomabu. The RAC factory here had been abandoned in early 1691, the goods in it being evacuated to Charles Fo1t, Anomabu (no.610). As is reported elsewhere in the Rawlinson correspondence (nos 518-21, 523), in September 1692 the chi.ef of the RAC's factory at Anashan visited Egya to arrange the reconstruction of the factory there with a view to its reoccupation, and in November a factor was sent to take up residence . The factory was occupied continuously thereafter, apart from intermissions in June.November 1697 and June-August 1698. It was not fortified, being described in 1694 as 'a small thatch'd house ... having little or no defense, except a few muskets' .1 Like Anashan, Egya supplied mainly corn, and also gold, but only small numbers of slaves. The principal traders from the interior bringing gold there, as in the 1680s, were the Akani (nos 960 etc.); but by 1699 the Akyem ('Aikims' ) are also mentioned (no.1042). Egya was situated within the state of Fante, hence the factory paid 'custom ' to the 'Bra:ffo and Couantiers' of the latter (nos 936 etc.). The Egya correspondence provides fuither documentation of Fante's foreign relations , notably its war, in alliance with Akani, against Etsi ('Attie', 'Attee' ) in 1693-4 (nos 946-7, 950) and the formal submission of 'Cabess Terra' (i.e. Etsi) to Fante in 1696 (no.IOI 7); and also of internal divisions within Fante, including disagreements over whether to assist Akani in its war against Denkyisa in 1698 (nos 1035, 1039), and fighting between the Brafo and his opponents in 1699 (no.1042). 932. William Cooper Agga Factory, 9 Nov. 1692 This only to advise of my arrivall and to render thanks for your kindnes se. I have not had any demands of customes yett, so cannot advise what they wi 11 have, but presume per next may satisfie. [PS] A receipt of goods I will send per next oppertunity. Agga Factory, 13 Nov. 1692 933. William Cooper My last only advised of my arrival, and have but little at present to advise of save that the Cabbosheers &ca demand the same custome as is paid at Annishan, which hope you will aprove of. 1 have received a small quantity of come and have the promise of a considerable quantiry more, wh.ichI have agreed for but I have no conveniency of keeping it, so desire [you) as shall have occasione to order it from hence. Tam in great want of 3 locks, 4 bolts for windows [and) a hammer, without the former I cannot well secure things. 934. William Cooper Agga Factory, 16 Nov. 1692 Yours of the 14 instant have received, since which have taken in much come. I know not what I shall do for lookes f=Jocks]. I am forwarding the come roome, which in 2 or 3 dayes will be ready for thatch. Here is a great demand for Bcnneen cloths, therefore I desire I may have 100 cloths (if you have them) as soon as possible. [PS] l have paid the Cabbosheers their custome. My hands are still very weak. 935. William Cooper Agga Factory , 23 Nov. 1692 I received yours of the 17 instant with advices of your intentions of sending the sloope hither,2 which I heart ily wish were here. I have now neer 500 chests of come, and unlesse some be taken off my hands know not where to put more. They ask here much for Cape de Verd cloaths against their danceing,3 so if you please to send down a few they will vend. I want a sword, musquett and bandyliers for the souldier, haveing non to secure us upon any accompt. Large windoes with iron barrs for the come roome I desire may be made, for what the Blacks have put up are to small and very unsecure. [PS] The canoemen demand for custome one slctia and two flasks brandy. The Agga men demand pay for thatching the Factory, fenccing &ca. Yesterday I opned the baill of boysadoes, whereof 7 are damaged, and a collJásslctia mentioned in the [blank) two cases to contain 41, the other being opened before contains 20, this find contains but 20 & a half. Agga Factory, 30 Nov. 1692936. William Cooper Both yours dated the 24th and 26 instant are now before me. I had when your last arrived, that ordered my forbearance of buying any more come except at l . a per chest, gott in with much adoe to the quantity of 550 chests, since which have seized [ = ceased] buying, endeavouring to break the price, which at present they will not come to, but I beleive in a little time they will comply. I long for the comeing down of the sloope, for I am much incommoded, haveing one little rome for all of us to stirr in. Pray Jett me have the Benneen cloaths per first opportunity, Cape de Verd cloths you advise there is non. Musquet, sword and bandylyars have received. Per bearer have sent the measure of the come roome. Windoes, Jett the barrs be mad[e] to naill on. The canoe men have left of their demands, but I am verry much pestred with the Agga men aboute fenceing and thatching the Factory, they say they will be paid and demand 3o 8a for their work, they denie they ever made such promisess you writte of. [As] for comeing to Cabo Corso at Christmass they never thought of it, and often tell me I keep the money in my hands. What to do with them I know not. Mr Searle & I according to your orders have viewed the boysadoes, and find 2 . damaged and 5 .damaged, as appears per inclosed certificat. 4 As for the . piece sletia have done as you bid me, have made 40. received. The Braffo & Corrantiers have sent down to demand their customes as Mr Cross paid them,5 have told them must first know if you will allow it, an answer of which they wait for. I have not elce at present to trouble you, only than.ks for your reiterated kindnessese. [PS] Pray let there be made two or 3 [word illegible] barrs, 11 or 12 in all, and some nails. I hope, Sirs, you'll dispence with me for rendering my accompts this month, writting being at present very troublesome to me. Per next month hope to render them more fair then now I can. My pain in my armes and Jeggs are gone, and begine to recover strength. 937. William Cooper Agga Factory, 4 Dec. 1692 This advises the sloope comeing, on board of whom I shall put what come she can take in. Here is the inquirie for Bennen cloaths. The Agga men still hold their demands, and threaten to carry away the fenceing aboute the Factory. Per next will send a receipt for what goods have received. 938. William Cooper Agga Factory, 10 Dec. 1692 Yours of the 5ll' instant have received, since which I have been much troubled with the Agga men about thatching and fenceing the Factory. They have not been so rude to take away any of the fence , but Captain Sham[ = Asham]6 has made it his bussines to stope the trade, biding the Agga men and rest of the Cabbosheers not to come here with any come or gold, but they_ tell me they will not obey his commands. He has troubled me much every day, and I perceive he is my chief desturber and could I gett rid [ms 'aid'] of him I believe might live much more quitley here. The Corrantiers have been to me also, demanding their custome as formerly paid them in a very rude manner (I am apt to thjnk sett on by Asham). After I had told them you knew notrung of their customes, so could not allow, they told me they would either have a say or they would not goe out of the Factory till they had seen me in a canoe. They stayed here till neer 10 a clock at night, haveing many souldiers neer the Factory, much perplexeing me., I being then much troub led with the toothache, so was forceid to deliver to them one sey. I am senceab le that I am to blame to exceed your order, but hope youl feavourably censure me when you know how they dealt with me, which Mr Jeffreys being then present can declaire unto you. I have put on board Mr Jefferys sloope some 160 chests come, being as much as she can well carry in the condition she is in, which wish well to Cabo Corso. lncl.osed is a receipt of the goods I brought with me . [PS] The Braffo has not yett sent for his custome, but I suppose it will not be long ere he does. If Bonashee once clears his pawne there will be hardly any liveing here or att Annim aboe.7 This also incloses Mr Jeffreys receipt for the come. Received from o n board the 13 hand canoe on accompt of the Royall African Company of England 41 . sletias course, 26 fine ditto, 20 Welch plains damnified ., 50 half firkens tallow, 100 lead bam, 10 half banells gunpowder, 60 seys, 21 boysadoes, 240 blue pautkies , received per William Cooper. 939. William Cooper n.d. [Dec. 1692] Yours dated the 13 instant this morning have received, wherein you seem dis.pleased [at me] for not adviseing whither or not the Agga men excepted the 6 or 7 peeze for both house and come roome. I thought I had mentioned in my last but one of their hold to their demands, but to exprese it more plainly they demand 7 peeze for the fence which incompases the Factory and 7 peeze more for thatcrung the house, without the come roome, which they will not medle with unlesse well paid, but I have forwarded it as much as possible with the slaves 1 have and help of other men, not without expence to myself. Asham and rest are now at a generall dancing, we cannot at present advise further what they will do. The say disposed of to the Corrantiers, since you wiU not allow of it, shall not charge it in my accompts. I have put on board the Alligator sloope 160 chest come more, and per the 13 hand canoe have sent 25 chests ditto, which togither makes 185 chests, I wish them well att Cabo Corso. 940. William Cooper Agga Factory , 20 Dec. 1692 Yours of yesterdays date have received, and shall endeavour to finish the comeroome with all peed. Mr Searle has promised me the help of his two slaves,which he can hardly spare, becaus they are every other day imployed in turneing his come. I have put on board the sloope, which i now under saill (but makesbut little way), 170 chests corne, and per the 13 hand canoe have sent 25 che tsditto, togither makes 195, which is all I had remaining. I hope the same maycome welI to Cabo Corso Castle. 941. William Cooper Agga Factory, 24 Jan. 1692/3 Yours of the I 0th instant which orders me to buy no more come till furtherorders, & that of the 16th instant wherein you require my accompts, with the 100gallons rum sent me att 9ta per gallon on accompt of the Royall AfricanCompany of England, have received, & accordingly per th bearer have sent my I ovember and December accompt . The ballance being only on[e] angle,needlesse I think to send you, shall carry to n xt accompts. [PS] Other day one of the women slave run away from me, and a I hear since isat Cabo Corso. I de ire you will give order to rernitt her unto me, but pray Jett her 1st have the lash. She i verry self willed, for I can hardly gett her to do theleast thing necissarie. 942. William Cooper Agga Factory, 6 Feb. 1692/3 Your of the 25th January last (wherein you advise of your receiveing myovember and December accompts), with the woman slave, have received . Thisserves to accompany my January accompt, which only mentions the yearlycustomes allowed by the Royall African Company of England, which I havepaid, [and] the charge of thatching and fenceing the Factory to the Agga menamounteing to 7 peeze, which you were pleased to order me to offer them, whichthey have at last (after much trouble) complyed with. I have had no trade since Ireturned from Cabo Corsoe.8 [PS) I have sent but one accompt, for which I hope may be excused, myweakness in my hands that I can hardly writte. 943. William Cooper Agga Factory, 8 Feb. 1692/3 Yours of yesterdays date is now before me with my last accompt, which youreturned to be con-ected, which accordingly have done and send by bearer. The gripes does very much indispose me, therefor hope the same accompt may satisfie. [gap in correspondence , mid-Feb. to July 1693) 944. William Cooper Agga , 1 Aug. 1693 Yours of the 15th instant have received, and have endevored according to order to purchase what come possible , but have not as yett gott in more then what my accompts (which came with this) mentions, viz 71 . chests. The Blacks haveing been so busie in takeing their small come, and the Abras pinyaring the Alta people, 9 near which place most of the come was fetched, hath very much delayed the bringing it heither, though they promise me now I shall have itt with all expedition, and here is considerable lyes to be measured, so that I believe that by the latter end of the next week I may have the whole complyment you order me to buy. The Blacks ask very much for blue and green Welch plaines , fine and course sletias, blue long cloths, knives, paper brawles, brass pans, which goods they chiefly demand for their come, which I desire 1 may be speedyly supplyed with. I have received of Mr Edward Searle 1. pieces of whit long cloth for 10the flag, but want rope for the halyards and ratlings ( = ratlines], with some canvas, which pray send by the bearer. 945. William Cooper Agga, 13 Sept. 1693 This I send with my August accompts. According to your orders have shipped on bord the Kathe1ine, Capt. Edward Curtis Commander, three hundred chests of come. I have taken no more money then to bear the factory expenses this moneth. Perpetuanoes and says I might have sold severall were they not rated so high, lOan a perpetuano & 15an a say they are willing to give and not more, which price if you please to approve of may hope to sell them at. 946. William Cooper Agga, 3 Oct. 1693 I received yours of the 16th past which advised of the receivi ng my August accompts, wherein you seem very much displeased at my writing about the price of says & perpetuanoes. I cannot perceive (nor do I know) what cause I have given you to doubt the least of my endeavours for our Masters interest. The small retumes this factory has made (am sure) is not my fault, and know no reason why you should impute it to me. I wish I were in a place where the trade might make it appeare whether I minded their interest or not, though I doubt not were aU things fairely accomodated here for a free trade [I] should soon make it appeare where I am. I honour the Royall Company as an other, & whilst I serve them shall be ready to my utmost to advance their interest. Thjs month I have not taken enough to defray factory charges, so must defer my accompts till next month, though 1expect no trade, being they are all preparing for the warr, being resolved (as I hear from every mouth) to fight the Attiees trus month.U 947. William Cooper Agga, 2 Nov. 1693 This comes to accompany my September & October accompts, wherein J have bought seaventy seaven chests come in part of the hundred chests you were pleased to order mee on the 13th past to purchase . I have not taken money , as appears by this accompt, to defray the charge of the factory these two months, and whil t the country doe continue this intended wan with the Attees wee can expect no other then a very mjserable trade. I heartly wish all differences were made up between them, for a trade [which] might answer the Roya ll Companys expectation. 948. William Cooper Agga Factory, 29 Nov. 1693 Yours of the 28th instant have received, with the two quarter casks mmm of Mr Edward Searle . The Cabbosheer of this place have been sev[er]all tymes with mee, and demanded two lead barrs and one halfe barrill powder for a dashee against their goeing to fight. I have offered them one lead barr and powder suitable, but they are not saysfyed, soe trus is to desire to !mow your plea ure whether or noe I shall give them what they demand soe unreasonab ly, especia lly con idering what little profitt this factory has been to the Royall Company. 949. William Cooper Agga, 5 Dec. 1693 Yours of the 1st instant I received, concerning the Cabbosheer demands, but though I told them you would not allow it they would not Jett mee bee at rest till I gave them at my owne charge . I have likewise received your of yesterdays date, with Robert Sutton, and acccording to your order have sent Thomas Farmer by the canoe. In two or three dayes I shall send up my accompt . 950. William Cooper Agga Factory, 9 Dec. 1693 Yours of the 6th instant I have received. Thi comes with my November accompt. The ballance being but 4a, I have passed to next accompt. The come haveing according to your order bought one hundred chests, I hope in a Jjttle tyme this Factory may make better returns to the Company then hitherto it hath done. The Arcanyes hath had the better upon the Attees as yett, and have sent downe severaU heads. 12 The Braffo [ms. 'Draffo'] is gone [i.e. to the war], and likewise Bonashee with his people, and this day marches all the Annamaboes and tomorrow all the people of Agga. 951. William Cooper Agga Factory, 13 Dec. 1693 Yours of the 9th instant advising of the receipt of my November accompts have received . This conveyance happening have made use of itt onely to know your order whether I may purchase any slaves, it being likely that in a very little tyme many slaves will present, 13 and also how I may dispose of them, it being dangerous to send them up by land. 952. William Cooper Agga, 3 Jan. 1693/4 Yours of the 13th December last ordering mee to purchase slaves have received, but as yet none have offered. 14 I humbly desire you will excuse my accompts this month, haveing had noe trade to defray factory expence, though by all appearance in a little tyme may expect a trade very considerable. 953. Wi lliam Cooper Agga Factory, 8 Jan. 1693/4 Yours of the 5th instant I have received. I would willingly render you my accompts every month, but I cannot see how I can possibly doe it, when I have not taken a era era to defray charges. The Cabbosheers hath been with mee for their yearly custome and I intended to write for cloth, but Mr Searle adviseing you have none, desire to know if I shall satisfy them with such goods as I have. 954. Willi am Cooper Agga Factory, 14 Jan. 1693/4 Yours of the 8th instant I received . Per bearer have sent one man and woman slaves, which if you like them shall charge the Royall Company with in my next accompts. 955. William Cooper Agga Factory , 5 Feb. 1693/4 Per bearer hereof I have sent my December & January accompts, and have satisfied the Braffo and Cabbosheers &ca as per the accompts appear. On the I ? ,..,,. first instant 1 bought two women slaves, and according to your orders of the 15 January last have put them into Anna[ma]boe Fort. 15 I am out of pautkies, blue Welch plaines , cases of spirits , which I desire you will send per first opportunity. 956. William Cooper Agga Factory, 26 March 1693/4 This only att present conducts my February accompts, bv which appears what a trade there is, and when a better will be I can not foresee. 16 957.

Phillips each fiftie chests come, in all one hundred chests, on the Royall Afftican Companyes accompt. 17 On Saturday last the fifth instant I bought a man slave, which have putt into Annamaboe Fort to Mr Edward Searles custody. 18 I wish trade would come in (as I hope it may now quickly), 19 that thereby I might be capable not only to pay myselfe my sallary but to render the Royall African Company more satis.factory returns. I desire therefore you will please to furnish me with six chests blue Welch plaines, pautkies, cases of spiritts, as you were pleased to write I should have. 959.

I have beene treating very hard with the Cabbosheers about the price, but they will spare none under two angles per chest, though there is enough here to be had. The reason is the Mine people which come here takes off great quantities at the price they now hold, soe I desire to know your pleasure therein what I must doe, tho I beleive as their new come opens they incline to abate. 960. William Cooper Agga Factory, 7 June 1694 Yours of the 26th of May past I received , ordering me to follow the orders sent Mr Edward Searle, which 1 will doe. Severall people have been with me and would glad(l]y bring it (i.e. corn] in at 1 Y2per chest, but the Cabbosheers of the towne will not Lett [ var. 'suffer') them. Per bearer have sent my May accompts wherein is mentioned one woman slave bought on the 10th of said month and putt into Annamaboe, which I forgot t to mention in my last letter. 20 Here is some Arcany men come, who want among other things about six ounces worth of bouges, 21 therefore desire you will send per this 2 hand canoe, which have sent on purpose, what quantity it can well carry. 961.

Yesterday I bought one woman slave, which have likewise sent him. I desire that I may have a supply of one hundred perpetuanoes more per first opportunity, severall of those remaining by me being a little broak, which hinders the sale of them. The Cabbosheers are now fallen to lY2aper chest for their come. PS. In oppening the bale of sayes I find most of them considerab ly damaged, which hope you will please to order they may be viewed.22 962.

I have made further inquiry about the visit the second of Cormanteen made to the Bra:ffo of Fanteen , and all that I can learn is that he went to know if the English had hired him to take the Fort , which is affirmed to me to be the only cause of his goeing.23 However shall be carefull still to enquiJe, and if finde any other intreague shall advise you. 964. William Cooper Agga Factory , 8 Aug. 1694 Mr Searle haveing noe come att present by him to load the 11 hand canoe , hath sent her hither,24 and [I] have accordingly sent by the canoe twenty five chests come. I bought one man slave the 4th in tant and put him into Annamaboe Fort, which I forgott to mention in mine of ye terdays date. 965.

I have gott my full complement of come you ordered me, besides what have delivered on the Royall Companys accompt, which have presumed to doe because the Blacks are willing to spare what they can before they stow their come in their houses, which after will be hard to gett of them att a greater rate. If you thinck fitt to order mor e (pray pardon my sentiment) I thinck now would be a very good time. PS. They will not be paid for the come with what goods have now by me. 968.

They easily drew the bolt, broack open his chest & seazed upon his mony, which was the vallue of7oz 7a gold. After I had received this accompt & heard the blacks affirme that their fetisch had told them that mony had been stole out of the Company factory I did not forbear urging the Cabbosheers to goe make a pallaver & with all speed to find out the roguery that had been commited in the Companys factory, telling them if they did not take care least they might be called to question for allowing such rogueries & without notice taken by them they sufferiog the Companys factory to sustain the least damage, upon which they unanimously made answer that they would searc h into the matter as much as they could, & after much debate & exami_nation among them according to their coustome made a ll such as they suspected to take fetiesches & [at] last brought me into the factory one Sam Paine, a black, as guilty, & for satisfaction delivered him up unto me for a slave untill such time as he paid what he hath stole, upon which I sent him to Annimaboe to secure him for satisfac ti.on to the said Robert Sutton for the losse of hi mony. The Cabbosheers doe all jointly protest they will be very riguorus to all such as shall hereafter or be found to cau e anything to the predju [di]ce of the Companys factory att this place.

Upon opening one of case of sayes that were last sent me I found them to be much damaged , upon which I have taken attestations which comes herewith. 999. John Brown e Agga, 11 Oct. 1695 This serves to advise that the late violent rains, together with the great weight of corn that bear upon the walls of the corn roome, w[h]ich are only swich [= swish], does greatly endanger it's falling &ca, it being already cract and tore in several! places, which hath occasioned me to remove as much com from thence into the factory as can secure from the weather, which shall keep in good case untill the arrivall of ships.

Humbly desiring your an wer by Mr Brownes servant. 1005. John Browne Agga, 16 Dec. 1695 I have yours of this instant, and find that you expect that what come I have over and above the ballance of my last accompt must be brought in at 1. per chest, but I a sure you that what come I have was all bought at 2a, and that at the time there was not soe much as one che t of come that could be purschased under that price, and therfore I hope you will allowe me the ame. I know that it wa reported and that Mr Rootsey did advice that the Dutch at Cormanteen had take in some come at 1 .a per come [= chest], upon which we left of buying, unti II had you[r] order or could bring them to take I .a.37 The reason likewise that I did not charge all my come last month was because I have gott everall chests upon tall ies that they owe before I have satisfyed the blacks or at Jest untill such time as I know w(b]at goods they will require , soe I hope that because all my come was not charged last month you will not suffer me to be a looser, but that I might not be found wanting to satisfy you áo farr as I can that w [h]at come I have was bought at 2a. After that I had received you[rs] I sent for all the Cabbosheers of this town and in pre ence of Mr Pupplett I told him [ = them] that I would buy their come if they would allowe it for 1 Y2a, but their was not one of him that would give his concent, but told me that they expected to sell their corne as formerly at 2a per chest, and that they must first send up to the Braffoe about it before they could resolve me any furder although [ms. 'aJsto' ] I doubt not but when that they are better satisfyed of the agreements that you have lately made with the other Cabbo beers to have it at 1 . but that they wil I readi ly comply. I shall observe to purcha e noe more come then I can preserve untill the arrivall of shipps. 1006. John Browne Agga , 27 Dec. 1695 This i to advise that upon the 25th instant the blacks in the neight did break through the t[h]atch over the warehouse off th.e Company factory, where they took up a deale board and oe made to them selves enterance off near two foots broad & 8 foots long reight down upon the goods, upon which I examined the goods remaining with my accomp t of what disposed , and found that they had take along with [them] two green perpetuanoes, and indeed I wonder much that they were content Lo take so Little, since the broak that they had made was so large, but it seems that they had been disturbed, or else satisfyed they had layed all things so ready for their the first designes against the night following, for before they left the please [= place] they had soe stopt up the hole that they had made through the thatch that it was verry hardily [=hardly] discoverable. I have called togither all the Cabbosheers of the town and have showed them where the factory is broack and the damage that is done the Company, and have told him [= them] to make search for the rogues that have broak the Company factory, or else expect that they and [ms. 'ane'] others will be called to ane accompt, and beforsaid to make full satisfaction. They tell me they will find out who't was that robed the factory and deliver him up to my hands, which I wish may prove true also [=a lthough] I can but little probability [sic]. What is necessary further to be done please to advise me and I shall be carefuH to performe. 1007. John Browne Agga, 7 Jan. 1695/6 This serves to advise that the Cabbosheers of this place are verry deligent in makeing search for the blacks that broak open the Companys warehouse &ca, and promise that if they cannot in 2 or 3 days discover to me the persones that have presumed to wrong and disturbe the Companys interest that they themselves will make full satisfaction to the Company for the losse they have sustained.

John Browne Agga, 14 March 1695/6 This is to advise that upon the 12 instant in the foornoon there came from Abra & Quomong severa l I blacks armed, who pan yard all the Mine blacks that they could catch there and att all other townes & places of the country towards the waterside. About the evening of the same day came hither Aquashee, the Captain of Abra, who gave strickt orders to all the waterside people for panyaring, but the poorer sort of peop le gave in their complaints, that if the Mine people were not suffered to come hither, they should loose a vent for the come, and that they could not tell how or which way to dispose of it, withou t a free correspondence with the Mine, upon which the Captain of Abra made answer that what he did was by consent & order of Braffoe and country, and that therfore they must have patience a little, and consider what injuries and abuses the Mine blacks had commited upon the English, their friends, who had never given them the least occasion of offence, 38 and for whom they had taken & received feitichees. I am credibly informed by the said Captain that the Fanteeners have allowed of and agreed upon a peace with the Cabess Terra people, and that upon very honourable terms granted to them by the Cabess Terras. The terms and way of agreement was thus: upon the 11th instant all the Cabbasbeers of the Cabess country came to Great Fanteen, 39 where they (in presence of the Fanteen Braffo & Cabbasheers) did most humbly intreat a pardon might be granted to them for all the insolenceys and injuries that they had formerly commited, & that peace and friendship might be concluded upon betwixt them for the future, whempon the Fanteeners did consider upon what articles it was fitting for them to consent unto a peace with the Cabess Terras, which being proposed it was at last agreed upon by both sides that for the future the Cabess Terras should be solely and wholly governed by the Fanteen Bra1fo and Cabessys, and that as they received them in their protection they were to do nothing without their consent, and that they would not att any time to offer to make war upon those they were with peace [= at peace with), and that when called they alwaies should be ready to help them against their enemies, and lastly that they should not any more for the future presume to mollest nor hinder the Arcanys nor any other blacks from passing through their countrey about there lawfull affaires and traffique with the whitemen towards the water side. If anything else happens here that is worth taking notice of comes to my knowledge shall not faile to advi e you . PS. It is aid that all the Arcaneys , who love to trade better then warr (excep ting Captain Dickie and his party) ,40 are very well satisfied with the peace, and that their enemes are brought to such unexpected subjection .41 1018.

Charles Salmon Agga, 1 Dec. 1697 Yours of the 29th November I have received, but the Braffoe took his leave of roe that day, and he is fully resolved that Quamon shall never goe any more to Cormantine. The Cabbosheers of Great Cormantine, and likewise of Annama .boe, bad two pallavers with the Braffoe concerning him. They proffered to be bound for his future fidelity, but to prevent the Braffoes consenting to it, I called him into my roome, and there told him the great danger of letting Quamon goe upon any security. The Braffoe liked my counsel[ very well, and is now fully resolved to have him up in the coun try with him, and there give him a severe fetish.47 Four of the Braffoes men have been with me this day, to whom I did communicate your Worshipps desire ,48 they imediately went away to acquaint their master of it. Here hath been several] peop le to buy perpetuanoes, but will not give eleaven ang les. They tell me they can buy them cheaper at Cabo Corso, and as for the damaged goods I received from Mr Sheldon, I know not how to rate them if anyone should want them, therefore desire your worshipps advice therein. Here will be Arcany traders in one week more, as the Braffoes men did this day informe me. I am now in great want for a carpenter , for the factory is so open, for want of doores and windows, that here is no security for the Royall Companys goods, the doore being off its hinges and the upper leafe of the back doore being quite gone, so that wee lye open all night. If the carpen ter comes he must bring two pair of good hooks and hinges, and two small pair ditto for the present. The Braffoe bid his men tell me he would be downe againe here with the traiders, at which time an exact accompt shall be given of all proceedings . 1026. Charles Salmon Agga factory, 14 Dec. 1697 This day one of the Braffoes men hath been with me, and tell me that his master hath been in the uper part of the country ince Fryday la 'tat three great towns, to settle all in peace and quietness, and to see how the town people there stand effected to him, he being expected back today or tomorrow at furthest. Captain Aqua is thi morning gone to Abra, the Braffoe sending for him before he took his journey. I have ordered Captain Equa [sic] to enquire very strictly how the palavers goes, and how the Braffoe and the up country people do agree,49 off which as soone as he retumes I shall give your worshipps a full accompt. The Cabbosheers here are very importunate for their customs, and in regard that Christmas is nigh, they desire that all may be send downe together, without any more trouble, which I most humbly desire may be done by first opportunity, they being every day very troublesome to me, and whereas I understand that Capt. Piles will saile on next Sunday,50 I humbly crave the liberty of coining to Cabo Corso Castle, to speak with him before he departs this Coast. I sent up last night a very good woman slave, by Edward Barter. I bought her from the Braffoes man, and gave them one ounce twelve angles for her. 1027. Charles Salmon Agga Factory, 8 Jan. 1697 [= 1698] According to your orders have by this Gambia slave sent seaven white pautkies, they being all that are sound, besides those six I keep for a new flagg for the factory. I would desire your worshipps to send me two quarter casks rumme for the use of the factory, and as soone as I hear how the Braffoes palaver goes with the Annamaboe Cabbosheers, who are now with him,51 I will give your worshipps an accompt. 1028. Charles Salmon Agga Factory, 12 Jan. 1697 [ = 1698] The carpenter Bastian hath seen what the present necessities of the Factory are, and therefore f thought fitt to send him to Cabo Corso againe to chuse what boards and nayles may be convenient for the present occation. The Braffoes man hath been with me from his master, and tells me that this new Captain of Abra is turned roague, having sett some of his people to waylay the Braffoe, one of which the Braffoes men took. He [ = the Captain of Abra] would have detained Aqua for Quamon ,52 but found it could not be done to his minde. The Braffoe will turne him out as soone as he hath settled other affairs.53 As for goods I only want fifty iron barrs, the Blacks buying nothing else at present. When I want anything else I will give your worshipps timely notice. 1029. Charles Salmon Agga Factory, 16 Jan. 1697/8 Whereas in my former letter I wrote for fifty iron bans, I now desire your worshipps to send 100 batTS, for nothing else goes off at present. I intended to f have sent up my accompts Lo Lbe last of December, but have been so ill ever since I came from Cabo Corso that I could not itt to any business, but hope it will goe off in a short time, and this month being so farr spent, if you think fitt I will make up my accompLs Lo the last of thi in tant. I have not sould many sort of goods, but heartily wi h I could. I have no news at present worth mentioning, but when l have I will informe your Worshipps of itt. 1030. Charles Salmon Agga , 29 Jan. 1697/8 This is to informe your Worshipps that the Braffoe is come, and desire to have Mr Buckeridge come downe with aU possible speed, 54 and to take Quamon out of iron and to bring him downe with him. 55 1031. Charle Salmon Agga Factory, 9 Feb. 1697/8 By this messenger comes Lhe ballance [of] my accompts in gold and likewise my accompt, in which if there be any error or mistake desire your worshipps th.at it may be sent back by the same messenger, with information where the fault is. Our Blacks here pretend they want crows and pittaxes to goe to work about riding away 56 the rubbish of the old Ca tle ruings [= ruins] ,57 I doe beleive two or three of each will be suffitient to keep as many to work a wee shall at any time find willing. The boy and gi.rle slaves complaine to me that their pay at three taccoes per month is so small that it will not buy them cankey, therefore they humbly petition your worshipps in this missive to take it into consideration about advancing their pay. The boy is able to doe as much as most ordinary slaves, and the girle may now be recconed a woman , for she does as much as any of the other three. As for trade, it is so small that I cannot take any money, they all goe on board the interlopers to buy what they want. The Blacks come to me to know if I will buy come of them, I tell them when I have an order for itt I will doe itt. As for the come that is here in the comroome, itt is fitt for nothing, therefore desire your Worshipps advice what to doe with it. 1032. Charles Salmon Agga, 12 Feb. 1697/8 I have sent my accompts rectified, but as for the black bafts I received no more then 113. T' is true Mr Sheldon did tell me there should be 115 and that he would send two more, but I never received them. I am sure that no traiders hath enquired for any, therefore they cannot be souJd, and there was noe more then 113 when the factory was inventored, untill which time they had not been medled with or stired from the time they were brought from Annamaboe. I have spoke to severall Blacks concerning the buying of come for damnified goods, and they have told me they will furnish me. I am now mend ing the topp of the corneroome, which is defective, but in five days more shall be ready to take come in, therefore I humbly desire to know what must be done with the rotten come that is here, for it is full of vermin and will spoile what good come wee take in. The Blacks have begun to rowsay the grass from about the old foit, and trouble me very much for dramms, telling me that you promised them liquor when they were at work, therefore desire to know your will in that respect. 1033. Charles Salmon Agga, 8 March 1697 /8 I have here sent you my February accompts, and have[ing ] taken in but little come, have omitte d it in this accompt, and intend to charge it to this month of March. I am promised a great deaJe, but I find our great talkers is the least doers. Edward Barter is this Monday gone up to the Braffoe, intending to retume this night if possible. Our people here are very backward in opening the ground about the old fort, but noe men more forward to drink up the Companyes liquors. As for news here is none stiring worth takeing notice off, only talk of a great trade speedily, it being very Little at present. The ballance of this accompt I have likewise sent, which is 15a l lt. I hope the next will prove better for the good of the Royall Compa ny, whose interest here shall be carefully dealt with by [me]. PS. I want some thread to make the fl!agg. I cannot gett none here, therefore desire some . 1034. Charles Salmon Agga, 27 March 1698 I have according to your order sent the duplicates of my accompts, but as for come, it comes in very slowly. I have taken in at this present noe more then twe nty five chests, but the peop le tell me in a short time they will bring what I want, which cannot be done at present, they being all soe busie clearing the ground and planting their come, that here is noe trade stiring for anything, exept some slaves, which are carryed aboard interlopers and there sould for goods, which they have at very low rates. Capt. Kempthome informes me that he hath two great gunns to dispose off, they are about 1200 lbs each, and carry a five pound shott, which if your Worshipps will buy he desiieS your answer to it. 1035. Charles Salmon Agga, 10 April 1698 According to your order have sent to the Braffoe, where I understand hath been a mes enger from your Worshipp . Neverthele ss I may know something more then your messenger has heard. The Dankeryes are every day k.irmadging with the Arcanyes,58 [the latter] have given the Cabbess country one hundred bendyes to as ist them, which money they have taken, bul doe not at all make any show of assi tance to the Arcanyes, who now grow very dubiou the case will be hard with them. They have sent messengers to the Braffoe for assistance, which he hath refused to give, telling them they were enemies to the King of Aguoffoe,59 therefore he would not help them, and with that answer sent the messenger back. The Braffoe has likewise sent me word to gett some new goods in the factory , for the people of a place called Bramang should be with me very speedily to trade.60 1036. Charles Salmon Agga, J2 April 1698 According to your orders sent a messenger yesterday to the Braffoe, which messenger returned about l O a night, with an answer that the Braffoe would be coming from Abra at the crowing of the cock. I hour.ly expect him. Doe believe it would be better to send that canoe I had at Commenda6l for those of Abra,62 and here is noe five hand canoe (but at Annamaboe there is). If your Worshipps think fitt of it I de ire a quarter cask of rumme may be sent in her, for I am in great want of it. 1037. Charles Salmon Agga, 15 April 1698 By this messenger comes my accorupts for March with its baJJance due [and] duplicates. Desireing your Worshipp that the rumme you last sent may be changed, for the canoe men have quite poiled it, by putting so much salt water in it that it' not filt to drink. I heard a great many gunns this morning from Cabo Corso, which puts me in mind your Worshipps have some good news.63 l have not sent any messenger to the Braffoe since his two men were here that went to Cabo Corso Castle, all things here being very quiett and silent at present. Th interlopers are all sayled from hence this morning, exept Capt. Kempthome , who will in a short time be ready to depart this road, he having almost his cargoe of slaves on board him. 1038. Charles Salmon Agga, 18 April 1698 Hopeing that by this time your great troubles about this makeing peace between the King of Aguoffoe and the Generali of the Mina is almost over,64 I come to lett your worshipps know of Mr Sheldons ill behaviour. When I came downe from Commenda Mr Jackson gave me a book of letters to deliver to Mr Sheldon, telling me that he had left it behind him when he was last at Cabo Corso about his accompts. I gave him the book of letters, since which time he has been dayly drunk, and told not only all the Commander s of the shipps here that I stole this book of letters out of his roome and carryed it to Cabo Corso Castle to show it your Worshipps on purpose to doe him a diskindness, but hath also reported it to all the Black s, makeing me as infamous as possible he can among them, and will not allow my servants to come to the fo11 with any message, but he is alwayes abuseing both me and them, soe that I cannot consult anything to secure the Companyes intrest here at this juncture of affairs, there being two potent armies not farr from us, and noe man knows what the conqueror may doe. The Braffoe stands on hjs defence, getting what men he can together in the feild, and if lie bee doubtfull wee ought to be careful), and not always drunk and abusive when wee should be upon business of such great consequence. In the next place he withholds slaves from coming to cutt wood according to your Worshipps orders for the burning of lime, they being here but one day , and then he sent but four. Thirdly , he had the impudence to break open the letter Mr Browne sent me,65 concerning the Serjeant at Annamaboe, and read it, and then brought it to me rumselfe, with that bare excuse he did it before he was mindfull of what he was doeing. Fourthly, he has feed the Cabbosheers of Annamaboe with abundance of liquor to stand by him, if he should be turned out of his present employ. Fifthly, he buyes all the silver he can, and hath agreed with a Black man in Annamaboe k:nowne by the name of Bruntue, to make silver and copper money for him,66 which the said Bruntue hath already done , and by relation some quanti tyes . This the Serjeant of Annamaboe will make oath off that Eggin told him of it,67 and that the said Eggin was at Bruntues house, and saw him make some, and then asked Bruntue who that bad money was for, Bruntue replyed it was for Mr Sheldon. I am sorry that I am forced to give this accompt of Mr Sheldon, for T doe assure your Worsrupps it is more out of respect to the government I live under then it is out of any regard I have to Mr Sheldon, that I had not taken a f severe revenge of him for his contumilies , for I know nott what impression it may make upon the Blacks. As for the book of letters, I hope yow-Worshipps and MTJackson [omission] that I am innocent of any such action, and hope your worshjpps will doe both of us justice. 1039. Charles Salmon Agga , 21 April 1698 l Last night was informed that the mobile 68 of Pantine, misledd by some of the great men, are very backward of bowing them elves in the feild, being most of them for I takeing the Arcanyes part, and impeaching the Braffoe of being an assistant to the Dan.keryes,69 and that the Dutch there are very busie with the Captain of Quoman, that Quaman is still following hi former projecktions. A for the affairs of Anna.maboe, they are canyed on with uch rediculous actions that it is more a place of discredit to the Company then anything else, there being nothing but drunkenness and quarrelling. Last night Mr Sheldon and his Gunner feU out about a whore , the Gunner being cut very dangerous ly in one of his hands.70 The men make dayly complaints of the misery they endure, by being beaten, and Mr Newman hath informed Mr Sheldon of all I wrote to your Wor hipps of him in my last to you, which I am ready to verifie to their faces on both side . As soone as the messenger returns I sent to Cabo Cor o on Monday last, I will send him to the Braffoe_7r * * * * * 1040. Charles Salmon Agga, 10 Jan. 1698/9 By thi bearer comes my duplicates for ovember last , butt cannot gett paper for my December accompts, in raegard I never received what was sent me by the Fauconberge. If Capt. John Luke72 wants more come I can supply him with about 40 chests. I am promised tenn more tomorrow, butt it is a black mans word j I must take for it, and as for gold I see none stiring unless it be silver, brass & coopper. I am of opinnion the Dutch have enveigled the Curranteers not to come to Cabo Corso Castle , or some of the King of Aguoffoes friends, of which there are ome jn this country, which pretend to be otherwise inclined. 73 1041. Charles Salmon Agga, 17 Jan. 1698/9 Our Cabbosheers have been very importunate with me concerning their customes, they refuseing to take whatt Mr Browne s advice to me specifies, which is three boysadoe s instead of five ginghams, and two Welch plaines. They tell me they are noe women to wear boysadoes, I tell them againe that though they doe nott wear itt yett they doe sell itt, being a vendable commodity of this country, and likewise the trade of either money or come is nott soe great or soe much furthered by any of them, than they shou ld be soe scrupleous of takeing their customes. AlJ that I can say of them is this, if any money be stiring tis carryed aboard shipp, and if have any soe badd thatt the shipps will nott take itt, tis brought to the factory, and as for come they bring just as much as they cannot help bringing when there is noe ship here, and thatt they want goods as may bee seen by my accompt. Besides an affront I lately received by one belonging to Aqua, which I will not now trouble your Worshipps with untill I see thatt justice shall be done me here. I understand they have sent a messenger with a goat privately to you, therefore I have thought fitt to give an accompt of this. 1042. Charles Salmon [Agga], n.d. (5/6 Feb. 1699) Mr Gore havein g given your Worshipps an accompt of a skirmish between the Braffoe and the people of Quaman, 74 on which relation here went soe many reports, and one not agreeing with the other, thought it might bee needless likewise to trouble your Worshipps with any imperfect message, but now I am informed of the truth, by the Cumanteers messenger, which is this: the traders goeing from hence, which is most of them Aikims, 75 the Braffoe intended to stopp them for seaven bendys they owed him, which the people of Quamon understanding thay sent out a party to rescue and convoy these traders through the country, and meeting the Braffoe and his party they had a small dispute, which lasted not long , but very unfortunat e to the Bra:ffoe, he being shot in the belly and through the upper part of his thigh about six inches above his knee, and likewi se the glance of a shot on the fore part of his head, and is in soe ill a condition that he cannot live ,76 therefore I humbly desire to know if there be anything in this case for me to doe here.
