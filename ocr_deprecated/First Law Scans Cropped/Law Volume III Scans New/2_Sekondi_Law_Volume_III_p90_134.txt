II SEKONDI is 30 km eas t of Dixco ve, 50 km west of Cape Coast.Sekoncti ('Succondee') The RAC had re-established its factory here, after a period of abandonment, in 1683. 1 It was fortified, though it was described in 1694 as 'of no grea t defence', having only 'eight or ten small pop iron guns, good for nothing but to waste powder, being all honey-comb'd within, and the carriages rotten and out of order' .2It was destroyed in an attack by local Africans in June 1694, and abandoned for several years. An attempt to re-establish it in 1698 was aborted, after less than two months, again under attack by African forces .3 The Dutch WIC also had a fort at Sekondi (Fort Oranjc), and there were Dutch forts in neighbouring areas, at Butri (' Butter oe' etc.), 15 km to the west (Fort Batensteyn), and at Shama ('Shuma' etc.), IOkm to the east (Fort St Sebastien), all of which are frequent ly mentioned in the Sekondi co1Tespondence. Sekondi supplied mainly gold, but also some corn and small numbers of slaves. In the I680s, the main source of gold sold there was the kingdom of Wasa ('Wassaw'), in the interior to the north, but this was no longer so in the I 690s; in 1694 an attempt was made to open a trade with Twifo ('Cuffere' etc.), to the north-east (no.244), but this was obstructed by the Dutch at Shama. More generally, trade at Sekondi in this period was disrupted by frequent wars among local African states. Sekondi and Butri were situated in the territory of Ahanta ('Anta'), 4 which had been conque red in 168 1 by lhe inland state of Adorn ('Adoom'). By the I690s, however , relations between Adorn and Ahanta had broken down. Willem Bosman refers to a war between the two which broke out in 1690, lasted 3-4 years, and resulted in the destruction by the Adorns of Sekondi. 5 The RAC correspondence pre ents a more comp lex pictur , in which fighting in 1691-2 broke out originally between two local chief in the Sekondi area, Asirifi ('Asherry ', 'Ashrevy') and Yankey (nos 151, 164), with the Adorns intervening in support of the latter. Sekondi was destroyed, in 1692, in this fighting between internal factions, rather than by the Adorns (nos 183--4). After a period of eclipse, Asirifi re-emerged, and il was he who destroyed the English fort at Sekondi in June 1694. As related in subsequent correspondence from Dixcove (no.50), the Adorns intervened, once again, in support of Asirifi's enemies in Sekondi. The RAC factors also allege that in thi Asirifi was supported by the Dutch at Butri, an aspect which Bo man's account uppresses. The reoccupation of the English fort in 1698 was carried out with the support of Adorn, but again opposed by the Ahanta (or a section of them), who were responsible for its destruction, in alliance with 'Li ttle Taggee', an exiled prince of Eguafo to the east, and again allegedJy operating at the instigation of the Dutch. 149.

Thomas Johnson Succondee Fort, 9 Sept. 1692 This accompanies the retum e of the 13 hand canoe. The 5 hand canoe is imployed in fetching stones, which could be sooner done had we more slaves to imploy daily in breaking them when the stones are brought ashore.

Thomas Johnson Succondee Fort, 27 Sept. 1692 By the Alligator sloop have received 3 small ca ks lime, which is already spent, so that without a further supply Thomas Wan the tanck maker must be idle as before for want of lime. The tanck is built at present about IOfoot depth, and doth require for finishing it above 16 cask lime, two casks hair and as the rest of the particulars. To have it arched or made flatt atop shall leave it to the judgment of the Surveyour. Sirs, att my first comeing here, haveing a great canoe then wanting canoemen as I wrotte you, and afterwards the mischance befaling the canoe and the 13 and 5 hand canoes long stay at Dickiescove when we had most occasione of them here, all these disapointments hath been the rea on of the backwardnes e of the tanck. If lime be scarce, which may as well be wanting at Dickies Cove as thi place, there are some places bettween Dickies Cove and this place where oy tershe!Js & wood are neer at hand to burn lime, if we be not hindred by the Dutch usage and frivoulous pretences. The Adoomes armey which lay neer Butterroe is witbdrawen for the pre ent,47 and one of their Cheif Captains came and told me that they have been often solicetated by the Dutch to molest and disturb the English settling at Didoes Cove, promiseing them great matters, which they refused, saying that they had no pallavers with the English that they would not molest Diclcies Cove,and had given their voues (=vows) and after much pallaver the Cheif of Buttero48 drew out his pockett pistole and offred it to the breasts of some of the Adoomes, upon which they all gott over the river into Buttero Town, notwithstanding the Dutch fireing there great guns, and killed and took away several! prisoners and persued the rest to Dicl<ies Cove, but would not molest Captain Dickie nor non of his Town people , I haveing ingadged Captain Anguiny, the Cheif Adoom man,49 not to desturb that place, you designeing to build their. Those goods I sell here the Blacks will not take out of the Factory but by night, for fear of the Dutch seizing of them, which in time may be a further hindrance to trade. [PS] I have received no hair nor bricks. Succondee Fort, 2 Oct. 1692200.

This accompanies my September accompts and baJlance, being mk4 0o Sa 6ta of gold on accompt of the Royall African Company of England. Sirs, 1 have also received yours of primo instant, which gives me very bad and unwellcome news of the murther of John Gregory , for which I am heartily sorry.5L The Adoomes Generali is reinforceing his army by Kuferoes and Danckeras ,52 and for his present designe I cannot for certaine writte you. (PS] Here is great reports by Negroes of English ships to windward, I have sent to know. Succondee Fort, 6 Oct. 1692201. Thomas Edwards Mr Johnson tells me that I am accused by your Honours of ploting, conspireing and [being] one who formerly should be ane instrument of raiseing your souldiers in rebellion against you and the Royall Companies Fort of Adtnirality. Sirs, I cannot but with tears lament my unfortunat condition in being accused of that which (I swear before God Almighty) I am not guilty of, neither did I hear of any such. Indeed after Mr Elwe death, being in company with Mr Gregory, [I] was told hi wrilte [ = 1ight] wa to succeed and hfa life for the same would venture , and that Mr Ronan was imperious and cruell over those he had power over, and instanced his killing the chyrurgion of the shlp he came over in after he had made peace with him and that he was the cause of the gunners death att the Hill by the Lewtenant, all which turned my inclinationes with the rest (altho indeed I had never any reasone to do or speak against Mr Ronan) to vote for Mr Gregory if it should come to a vote,53 wherefor I intreat you to have me free & and not suffer my good name to be inserted as an usurper or disturber of the Royall Company concerns . Sirs, you have alwayes showed me great and undeserved kindnese, and humbly begg youll consider me still and look upon me as [your most obliged, obedient and humble servant ]. 202. Thomas Edward Succondee Fort, 18 Oct. 1692 The coppy of a letter to the late deseased ,54 which I did indeed signe to on the named reasons contained in my former, I received , wherein there is nothing of conspiracy against the Royall Company nor any elce as I can deseme [=discern], which I have likewise in my former avowched to God, before whom we mu tall an wer, and I may again affirme my ' tarrs fattell [ = fatal] that ever I cam[e] here to be accused of such actions, but God who [e] providence I hereto and till will depend upon I hope will free me from the ame. on55203. [Thomas Edwards&] Thomas John Succondee, 19 Oct. 1692 Yours of the 11" instant I received, this being my 3'1answer. My first was of the 6" past in answer to yours of the 5th ditto, wherein you are pleased to charge me with plotting conspiracie a[i]ming the Royall Company ruine, which I do still say I am ignorant of what you do charge me, so do refer to your sounding the depth and then to know what you alleadge against me, and the second was by Hansico, by whom I sent with my accompts on accompt of the Royall African Company of England mkl 2oz 15 angles and 9 taccoes, and also a certificat by all the white men here to certify that I have not exacted nor extorted anything from any of the natives in thls place , and with everall other matters which I hope will satisfy you, and I doubt not but plainly to clear your charge, whlch you are not realy possitive in. When the 3 marchants place was vacant by the death of Mr Elwes, then understanding that Mr Ronan was to succeed I spoke some words to the Chaiplai11and severall other Gentlemen att table and also to and Mr Whiling and received a very satisfactoryyourself (i.e. Joshua Platt) answer, and since what I wrote to Mr Grego,y, being one of the Chiefe marchantts (Mr Platt the 1st and particularly from the Company),56 I am sure there was no plotting, conspiracie and endeavouring to make the souldiers lay down their armes, aiming the totall ruine of the Royall Company. Sirs, 1am an English man & a Protistam, who never were counted plotters.51 As far as I wrotte you concerning lime to be made at Taccarado or thereabouts I cannot perceive how I have contradicted it, without it was to exprcse the mallicious & frevou.lus pretences which the Dutch too often make in pretending rights to places that they have nothing to do with all.58 The Dutch Cheif at Buttroe stoped this letter of the Surveyours, 59 which was afterwards sent hither by sea, so for the future I can not expect to send by land. Succondee, 28 Oct. 1692204. Thomas Johnson Yours of the 25th past have per Mr Jeffryes received with some lime, which will not finish the tanck, as I formerly wrotte for 6 hogsheads. No news from windward. Succon dee, 7 Nov. 1692205. Thomas Johnson Yours of the 3dinstant have received and the inclosed were sent by sea.60 Non of our slaves dare venture to go by land, one of them since I formerly wrote you haveing received some cutts on his hand and foot in strug ling to gett from the Dutch slaves when they seized him. This accompanys my October accompt and ballance, being one ounce 15 angles and 11 taccoes on accompt of the Royall African Company of England , and inclosed comes also the particul ars of the Dicltie s Cove slaves pay. [PS] Be pleased by the returne of the 5 hand canoe to send us some casks of good water, which we are in great need of, & some look s [= locks] and keys for the gates of the Fort . 206. Thomas Wann Succondee, 8 Nov. 1692 Mr Johnson informes that your Worshipps wrote him that you cannot understand I should have occa ione for so much lime, haveing sent sufficent to build such a tanck a your Wor hipps supposeth it to be, so I have made bold to give your Worshipps the peruseall of a small epistle, the subject of which is to acquaint your Worshipps of my present occasion. Imprimis I hall want 30 deall boards, 200 bradd nails, a ladder, with about as much more lime, which I impute [= compute] to be 20 quarter ca ks. I request your Worshipps consideration. The to [sic] tanck consists of 16 foot in the clear diamiter , 13 foot depth and will contain about 60 tun of water. Likewise if the swich [= swish] had not [been] extraordinary it would have occasion for a considerable quantity more. The timber I have in areadiness in order for covering the tanck, so that if your Worshipps will be so pleased to order me what I have here above peciefyed there shall neither be care nor diligence in me wanting towards the finishing of it. The tanck had been performed long since had I been supplyd with stuff and slaves. What already is done wa performed by myself, which I find very hard without the assistance of some troueU [= trowel] men, but as I have promi ed your Worshipps to finish what I have undertaken (God preserveing my life and health) I will performe my word, desireing in the conclusion that your Worshipps will be so favorable, the next English ship that comes, if my [ms. 'any'] work performed, haveing my discharge from the Royall Company and my time expired, to grant my passage for England and in so doeing your Worshipps will very much assist [me]. [PS] Upon a second con ideration that if your Worshipps are pleased to order timber to be cut at Dickies Cove and conveyed to Succondee we shall have no occasion for deall boards or naills. 207. Thomas Johnson Succondee, 12 Nov. 1692 Yoursof the 11th instant I received and for your satisfaction have sent down the slavewho is not fitt for service by the injury he received from the Dutch people by carrying a letter to Dickie Cove, and as to what the Generali writes in defence,61 I will prove by all the White men that the Company slaves are here no otherwise imployed then aboute the Companys bussinese here, about the Fort and sometimes a carrying a letter to Dickies Cove, and do not goe apadling [=peddling] about the country for me nor non that lives under me, neither do our slaves abuse any of them, being alwayes at work, but it is verry plain their slaveshinders our traders, for when they buy any goods they are forcied to take themout in the night for fear of being seized, and the Coopeman of Sumay62 and this place never made any complaint to me of our slaves abuseing any of theirs, so that you may see he hath nothing elce to bring them off but by such exc uses. T do not know wherein J have neglected the Compa nys bussinese , I have at all times observed your orders, which shall not be wanting in me, and as for writting the duplicats of accompts I have no paper, which could I gett should never be the occasion of your displeasure. Thomas Wann, who is sick, hath received 3 casks lime , and he saith without you wilJ be pleased to send the lime he wrotte for (20 hogsheads) he cannot finish the tanck. Mr Clarkson had the inventory of the necissaries of the Castle, 63 I have wrotte him about it. [PSJ Mr Rynhout is removed from Sumay, its said he goes to Axim, the Generalls brother supplies his place. PS. As concerning Taggaba, 64 its aboute 3 weeks since came here one of her canoes from Axim who put in here for water. I haveing a letter then of the Surveyours which I gave the canoemen and two taccoes, they being bound to Cabo Corso Castle, for which they ask 3 angles, and since the same canoe men came here with your letter of the 3d past with another for the Swáveyor [and] I could not then send by land , I was forcied to make use of the canoe, and when they were up Mr Jeffryes toke [= took] their small canoe and {I) put the 2 canoe men in the 5 hand canoe that came down the other day and now in [the) 5 hand up again, for which theask [= task) imployed them no more then from this place to Dicl<ies Cove, becaus I could not send by land, and they being Cabo Corso canoemen I judged they might be paid at Cabo Corso for their whole voyage to Dickies Cove as useuaJ. I would pay the fellow for his voyage from this place to Dickes Cove but he wi11not take it. Succondce, 14 Nov. 1692208. Thomas Johnson This canoe comes on my charge with the slave I mentioned in my last of Ith past, who was left behind by the overhasti nese of the canoemen. According to your comma nds I will not suffer any afronts to be given to any people, but shall at all time s give you accomp t of all passages. Succondee Fort, 14 Nov. 1692209.

Thomas Johnson Yours of the 25th past I received, by which understand my linguister hath been to make his complaint as that I have not paid him. He stole from me some lime since 6 peas and 3 angles. The matter being so plaine against him, I by his earnest request, be being an old man and a servant to the Company & his promising satisffaction, I did not then take notice as in case of theft is descrveable, and as for the waiges he has never been out of my debt since I came here, besides what he stole, and since his returne he hath in the presence of Mr Rives paid me in part of the accompt between us 6 peas 3an. The reports of Black s guilty in this maner I hope are nol valued. There are others that owe me money and are unwiling to pay and may give you the like trouble. Herc is Captain Anta, who is now afraid lo come nere this factory by the Dutch threatning, hath not received as you may perceive by my accompts his sallary this many months, therefore I have not charged it.

I desire you will send Richard Richardson to view the same. The carriages of the guns which were mended about six months past are much rotten & requires new, with severall necessaryes as here under written.

I find the major part of you are not as well acquainted in the business as Mr William Ronan is, therefore referr you to my letter to him of the 7th instant. 75 I would have waited on you sooner then this letter, that by verbally the businesse might bee better understood, but was hindr ed by not haveing the use of my lymbs, and in the interim shall take care that noe injury shall come to the Company, and myselfe to, having received a great deal already, Mr William Ronan having received eight ounces eight angles from those that have inj ured mec in part of satisfaction. I therefore appeall to you to know who is in tbc wrong or whether I am the ogressor [= aggresso rJ or noe. Soe hoping in a short tyme to waite upon you. 234. Thomas Johnson Succondee, 12 Dec. 1693 Per Mr John Pinck comes the dupli catts of my several! month s accompts. As to the slave you mention in your last, r referr it to the disco urse of the bearer. 235. Thomas Johnson Succondee, 21 Dec. 1693 Yours of the 14th instant I received. I would very willingly have waited upon you, but being newly recovered cannot be able soe soon to make such a voyage, but hope by the end of the month to come with my accompt. As concerning the slave that are runn away, it is not from anything of severity shown by mee. ltt is very hard for the white men to live here, by rea on wee can scarce gett victualls to putt in our mouth , and much more for the laves, which I hear to bee their complaint. Hopeing to have strength in a little time to performe the voyage. 236. John Pinck Succondee 9 Jan. 1693 [= 1694) This comes to acquaint you that la t night came a canoe to this place with some perpetuanoe and other interloping goods. One of the white men (by name Benjamin Sewell) being then at the waterside, did offer to seize the ame but was very much beaten by them, one holdeing him and the other holding a naked knife at his breast whilst the rest beate him. I have with much difficulty seized on one of them with the canoe, soe crave your orders for my government herein, which shall be observed . 237. Thomas Johnson Succondee, 15 Jan. 1693/4 By this have sent you two ounces seaven taccooe and half, being the estate of William Harden deceased, deducting fourteen angles and nyne taccooes due. 238. Thomas Johnson Succondee , l Feb. 1693/4 This accompanyes my January accompts, by which you') ee that the money taken in these parts will not defray Factory charges. 239. Thomas Johnson Succondee, 8 Feb. 1693/4 Pray send on accompl of the Royall African Company of England fifty perpetuanoe blue, one hundred dozen of good knives, two chests of sheets . 240. Thomas Johnson Succondee, 11 Feb. 1693/4 Yours of the 9 past have received with one hundred and four dozen of knives , one hundred perpetuanoes blue, for which shall give the Company credi.tt for. According to your commands shaU treate Adua Keosah ( = Hensah] and those his people that may come, and give all encourageme nt possible for the keepeing the way open. Adoom Assherry that lives up Sumay River76 and Jappo that lives on this side of Sumay are the only men to bee encouraged. 77 Shall want some cloaths for the same purpose. 241. Thomas Johnson Succondee Fort, 25 Feb. 1693/4 This serves onely to advise you that Adua Hensa's peop le was here and bought a parcell of knives and perpetuanocs, which were seized on by the Copeman of Sbuma and they themselves are confined in their prison, soe desire you would bee pleased to send your orders, that wee may paniair other people 10 gett our traders goods againe, for they are resolved not to buy their goods here unlesse wee can protect them. They [= the Dutch] are dayly panyaring their goods and confining the men. Wee may bee in likelyhood of a good u-adc, provided wee can protect our traders. The Dutch are constantly selling [= seizing] a goods, and those that wee sell wee are foirced to send away by night, but still they are seized on, soe desire you would bee pleased 10 seize on a Dutchman or two, to make us satisfaction for the affront received, or doe you seize upon the Copeman Lett not theof Morea and Com1antine, who you have dayly al your Fort.78 Company bee abused and laughed al by the Dutch, who dayly makes it their business to molest them. [PS] I am very bad and have been troubled with convulsion fitts and am now in a very bad condition, as Capt. Shirley and Capt. Phillips can both informe you.79 242. Thomas Johnson Succondee, 10 March 1693/4 Yours of the 2151 of February received by Captain Anta, to whom I have paid his sallary for January & February last, and according to your orders have advanced rumone bendy, which goods no sooner carried out of the Fort but were seized upon to pay his debts. He is a man that does not vallow me but stands in great awe of the Dutch, as all these people doe. This accompanyes Aduhenyusis boy, who is come to make his complaint and desire your assistance against the Dutch for molesting their trade and seizeing their goods continually. I never heard that ever we panyard any of their goods, and we have as much reason to doe it as they, and it is the greatest affront imagi nable that they should molest our trade. I have this day received yours of the 6th of March with six yards of scarlett cloth, which shall be disposed of according to your orders. I cannot yett send downe my accompts, but soe soon as I am a little better they shall be sent downe. PS. You mentioned in yours of the 21st of February that you were informed that I pinyard the people of thi place that I am not concerned withal!, which indeed, Sirs, is a mistake , I have trusted them money and have pynyard them when they could not pay me, and severall others owe me for goods , and likewise Captain Anta, and must I not pynyard them if they will not pay me? My promoting of the Companies interest is the promoting my owne. Mr Pinck & all the white men are sick of a feaver. 243. Thomas Johnson Succondee, 15 March 1693/4 10thThis comes to acquaint you that Benjamin Seven dyed the and John Warrington the 14th instant, the former of which being worth little and the other haveing his money out amongst the Blacks, have found but 12a in gold and nothing else but his necessary clothes. We are for the most part very much out of order & sickly, soe desire you will send up 3 or 4 men and lett me order that one of them may have some allowance above the rest to act as Serjant and Gunner. Aduhenna his boy ha been with you these seven dayes, soe I hope you have done something as to the encouragement of trade. Some of Aduhenna his boyes in these few daye have been here and tells he will send noe more money here, for they see that we are not able to protect their goods nor recover those that are painyard, which is a great prejudice to the Company. There comes inclosed an inventory of the estate of John Warrington and I shall use your orders how they shall be dispo ed, whether I shall sell them here or send them downe to Cabo Corso. Benjam Sevell had no more than what he wa buried with except an old coate and paire of drawers, both not wortth 6ta. PS. Warrington hath a boy which I will buy if you please. He hath abundance of outstanding debts by the blacks his wench who is mn away knows off. 244. Thomas Johnson Succondee, 22 March 1693/4 Yours of the 16th instant I have received with the new Generall Staphorst['s] letter,80 the interpretation of which you will find very insignificant and a mere flame [= flam].81 You are encible when he lived at Morea, when very much inferiour to what he is now, he could di putt with you as his equall , much more now he is in his new place. Where [=were] he or the Coapeman of Shuma in another, I could soon tell them that they are in the wrong, for there was no interlopers att that time from Cape Tres Pointas to Agga.82 Such an affront as this might be soon and easily remedied . I have two Dutchmen on my right hand and as many more on my left.83 Those blacks that you call our poor friends they love us but are afraid of the Dutch, and what conduces more to a trade then fear? The Dutchman my neighbour his people sent him from Mina, Comenda, Shuma &ca by the Generalls order to geu fish for them, but wee have none to gett fish for us [ms. 'use'] but are forced to stand to their curtisie [=courtesy) for what they please to give use for our money. As for proving of the goods to be ours, the circumstances are soe plaine that it needs no proofe. The traders in my predecessors tyme tbey were Wassaws, [who] live quite another way from what the Cufferes [var. 'Croffies'] doe. Since I have received yours of the 19th ditto, and give you thanks for sending me those two men in the roome of those deceased. By this comes the estate of the deceased John Warrington who in his sickness had nobody to look after him but his black wench, who immediately after his death run away unknown to any but those of her couler [=co lour] . Wee have soe much sicknesse here that the living could scarce see the dead interr'd. Bradua Ahenesa84 grows now very strange, and am affraid he will make his words good. I may presume to saythat there is nothing wanting in me to the encouragement Lof]a trade. l have given encouragement for a trade in a place where I have not had my health nor the use of my limbs for this fifteen months, as you are all sencible of itt. Sirs, I have often wrote to you the bad condition of this fort, and 'tis a hard case I cannot have a dry roome to lie in. 245. Thomas Johnson Succondee, 24 March 1693/4 My last to you wasá of the 22d past. Since dyed Mr Charles Hamilton, and hath made his executor Mr John Pinck. 246. Thomas Johnson Succondee Fort, 30 March 1694 Haveing this opportunity of a canoe bound to Cabo Corsoe, to certifie you that yours of the 24th instant I have received. I need not to prove any further, but lhat we may now as well beleivc Ado Henasa and his people that the goods were his that were seized at Chuma, as we beleived him when his goods were seized at Comenda, 85 and in my predecessors time I know & saw with my eye that the Blacks bought goods in the factory and carried out in the night, and soe they did when I first came and have ever since, and who can wee judge these people to be afraid of? Sirs, I doe desire your leaves to come to Cabo Corsoe in a few days and then I shall give you an accompt more plaine & large then this short time will perrnitt. 86 Sirs, I am very sorry that you should againe say that I doe not obey your order , for if you will inquire of the great canoe you will finde that I sent Warrington things therein, and 'tis a little to hard for me to pay the charge of a canoe to carry downe the Generalls letter which you ent to me to translate. The inclosed i an account between John Warrington and me a my econd. Sirs, there are severall others that are desea ed indebted to me, I desire you will be pleased to take notice of it. lnclo ed come the copy of the deseased Charles Hamiltons will. 247. Thomas John on Succondee, 12 Ap1il 1694 This accompanys my February & March accompt with the ballance, being one rnarke five ounces & seven angles & eleven taccoe . 248. John Pinck Succondee , 17 April 1694 This come to desire you to send per bearer sixteen or seventeen ounces of corraJl, here being an Adoom Cabbosheer that wants soe much. PS. The Fort is ready to fall downe about our eares, the maine guirder [= girders] being rotten in [the] waUs, unles peedily pr vented 249. Thomas John on Succondee , 8 May 1694 Yours of the 18th of Aprill I have received with a parcell of corraU mentioned to contain 78. oz. On weighing the same without its [w]rapper or cover found it to weigh but seventy six ounces , for whi.ch I give the Royall Company creditt. With this come á my Aprill accompts ballanced. By thi have sent seven of the Companyes old mu ketts not fitt ervice, de ire others in their roome , and also some muskett shott , and 3 or 4 scaine of Engh h match . I trouble you once more to Jett you know the great occasion wee have here for both carpenter & bricklayer, for now the frequent raines we have here doth us more injury . The carriages of our gun are rotten, and some of them have none, when they were lately mended they had nothing but new wheels. As also our warehouse lately which had nothing done, for want of boards, but two or tree sticks or props put up. And by reason of such botching we are continually wanting. By this l have sent you downe according to your commands the last will of Mr Charles Hamilton deceased to be registered. Succondee Fort, 15 May 1694250. Thomas Johnson This serves only to advise you that the country is again up in armes, by the roguery of the Dutch, & their party, [they] doe threaten the surprisall of this place, as they formerly did in my predecessors time.87 Wee cannot bee too carefull in watching such dangerou s enemies, haveing an instance of the Danes sufferings before our eyes. 88 We are thus informed dayly by the Blacks, who tell it for a great secren, soe desireing you will please to send three or four men more, it bein g very hard for four men to doe duty day & night, which we are forced to keep them to, in being my part to acquaint as near as I can learne. 251. Thomas Johnson Succondee Fort, 21 May 1694 Yours of the 1gth instant I received with two white men, and seven musquets. Anta Sherry [= Asherryl by the Dutch assistance is released from the Brandenburgh,89 and is now att Butteroe makeing great preparations for warrs, and most of the Blacks liveing with my neighbour are gone to his party, and they are soe confident that they shall gett the day that they doe allready begin to play the rogue in hindering these poore women and children that live under our protection from buying come, fish or wood, as likewise our owne slaves. I doe not know what will be the effects of such practizes, time will learn us. Captain Anta, to whome you have given his sallary and advanced money to build him a house, dare not goe through with it for fear of the Dutch, neither can he come from the Dutch towne (the place of his abode) to see me [ms. 'seem'] but with the Dutchmans leave. I shall obey your orders in keeping a faire correspondency between both parties and trouble myself with none. 252. Thomas Johnson Succondee Fort, 9 June 1694 This serves to advise you that on the 4th instant arrived Mr William Smith and Mr Edward Barter, and on the 6th ditto Anta Sherry, who has pitched his camp between the two Forts. 1 sent to him to know what was his designe, he told me that he had nothing to say to us, but soon after he began to destroy and take away our peoples houses. I sent to forbid him to go on, and my linguister asked him why be did not goe to the Dutch and take thatch, his answer was that the Dutch were his friends and he had no pallaver with them. According to your orders that 1 should conceme myself with none, I sent him word not to lett his people come within a limited place , but not withstanding my soe many warnings they would be intruding upon our liberties , and this present instant were intruding . I fired over them, upon which they fired agrun, narrowly missing John Pinck, and hitt a boy behind him, upon which the Dutchman hoisted his flagg in their camp and I hoisted ours, and hall stand by it as long as I have a drop of blood in my body. This come expre and is lo desire you to send us some beef, bread & oyle, or else now wee may starve, being upon our defence. Mr Smith came ashore sick and has been soe ever since. I myself can scarce gett off my bedd, and one of our men [also]. I know no mason the Dutch should encourage them a to lend them the flagg to plant it or lett it blow under the command of my gunn , when they have already acted in ho tile manner again t me. Pray send me ome sheep skins, small nailes, bandiliers, cathrrage paper, rammers & spunge staves, small wire, and be pleased to Jett the carpenter come & bring some board & planks to make carriages, for we have scarce one fitt for service and we are much necessitated for them. Which is what for the present offers, being in haste. 253. Thomas Johnson Succondee Fort, 9 June 1694 Mine of this date at 10 a clock and [advising] of the danger we are in of Anta Sherry, haveing offered me severall affronts and haveing planted the Dutch flagg, after which I could not by noe means thinck myselfe secure, he encroaching upon our Jibertie . According to your orders thought fitt to tru t none. Seeing he could not be keept off us, according to your comm.ands I gave him orders to retire, which they tooke no notice on. According to your orders that I am to trust none, thought fitt in defence of myself to fire at him, to keep him off by fireing at him. They came into the towne where our people formerly lived and sett itt on fire. Wee then soone engaged them. with all our force , notwithstanding their attempts were soe bold to sett our slaves houses, come houses &ca on fire about us, which much endangered the Fort, in soe much that there was not a window about us but were filled with shott, they being soe lowe, wee haveing but seven men, three of them being wounded at the first engagement, we had then little assistance. I have Jost abundance of my owne people, two of the Companyes slaves wounded, I doe not know whether they be dead or noe, being in haste, neither can I in reallity say whether I can at this maintaine the Fort or no, but there shall be nothing wanting in me. People that were with me in my roome and warehouse were wounded, shotts comeing thro both. I was forced to come to a parley, most of my people being wounded and the rest out of heart. Soone after came the Dutchman my neighbour , who soon after came here, nothing discommended the blowing of the flagg and the couradge of the people, saying they had the flagg by orders. Sirs, I allways advised you that he was an enimy Lo us and [there was] noe trusting of him. Take what the present offers, being in great danger att this time. I had the luck to have Mr Barter , who has behaved himself very valliantly, who after John Pinck was wounded was everywhere his presence was necessary. Our granadoe shells, which wee soe much wanted, were not worth that name, scarce three of them being filled. I have lost all my sheep, goats & provisions, and I have nothing left wherewith to keep me & my men, but must starve without your immediate supply. Lee, one of the Companys slaves, is panyard by them. I am in haste. 254. Edward Barter [to Thomas Johnson] 10 June 169490 These serves only to advise you that Anta Asherry demands three case bottles of rumme more & two whole barrels of powder before he will come to any agreement with you. Therefore I desire you to give him what he demands at present, and I beleive the latter palaver will be nothing more, upon the provisall you will be true to hjm and he to you in takeing feteches togather, and I am sure you will not come off under one whole barrell, therefore send him word you cannot and have noe more than one whole barrell with three case bottles of rumme, for I find your neigbour is not of our side, and pray take my advice. 255. Thomas Johnson Succondee Fort, 14 June 1694 I hope ere this you have with you Mr John Pinck, who departed from hence yesterday with our wounded men. I would then have wrote you, but being then very much indisposed I could not, soe refened him to you. What I have done hath been nothing but what was in my owne defence, and that I had understood of his [ = Asheny's) many lhreatnmgs and he being soe much encouraged by the Dutch, haveing their flagg which they blanded [= brandished] in opposition to me, and with them the Dutch Generalls boy & staff. They would neither give me my assurance nor be limitted to any reasonable bounds, that I could think myself secure, knowing well that there is little confidence in a Dutch & there adherences [=a dherent s], [having] well experienced it before I came in these parts . Tho se my present enemie could never have the knowledge and courage to have gott soe on were they not instructed by some Europ ian. After wee had soe fired on our owne defence, before we could load our great gunns againe most of our white men were wounded, our thatch walls on fire. On my side I have noe black men with me except women & children and some few boyes, which are of little service. With our lower ports to clear the enemy from the door and windows, we played our parts, and when any of them that engaged us fell or wounded their places were soon supplyed by the great number s that were of them, most of my people wounded or killed , the night comeing on, and being surrounded both with fire & the enernie, I thought it better and the safer way than to hazard all, to call out to them to come Lo a parlie. They would not comply untill they saw the Dutch Cheif comeing towards them, soe th y left off and were came to a pa Ila ver the next morning, sessation [ = cessation] of armes agreed off on both side for twelve dayes,91 but notwithstanding I every day [am] anoyed by their blundering [=plundering] all they can from me, which I [am] forced to beare by reason I have but two white men fitt for service, myself being both sick & lame, and noe provi ions, otherwise I should not beare [it]. All those people which promised Jappo help, the Dutch Generall have ingaged to de ist and with threatenings that if they should assist Jappo [he] wi 11 bring on them the up country people to destroy them, soe that Jappo cannot now appeare against the enemie wee stand in danger of. They goe with the Dutch flagg, and is encouraged & directed both by the Dutch Chief h re and he that live at Butteroe, who followed them here, which he could not lie out of his Fort without orders from his Generall. Anta Asherry with the help of the Dutch hired a great quantity of people from Dickies Cove, did us a great deale of hurt after wee had soe agreed, they would not forbare, still take away every thing l sent to be dressed,92 seazing from the slaves fowles & every thing they could gett, which I [am] forced to beare with, haveing but two white men fitt to ingage & noe provision, they haveing prevented us. Since I have had the bad luck to see this ugly bussiness, would gladly see an end. These things would had been putt in execution before had not Jappo and Auguan beaten them.93 Just now ar.Tived Amo, 94 to whom I referr.95 * * * * * 256. William Gabb Succondee, 24 April 1698 This comes humbly to acquaint your Worshipps 1 could not gett hither till this morning about 3 a clock. As soone as twas day the towns people was all on the sands. I went ashore, they sent for Ringoo, King of the Doomes.96 The Cabbosheers was earnest to have the flagg hoysted, which I did as soone as possible. The Dutch Coapman sent his cane to me three times before l had done. The fourth time he sent to demand of me the reason I did not come to him, he sending so often, for all palavers must be made in his Castle. Then I sent to tell him I was about my masters business, but by and by should be at leasure, and would meet him anywhere out of his Castle, so wee mett betweene the Castles. He asked me if your Worshipps had told the Generali of the Mina that you would settle againe at this place. I told him that was not my business to enquire affter. He said he thought the Dutch and English was friends. Yes, said 1,and it may be best to keepe soe, and with a few words wee parted, but understand he is displeased and doe write to the Mine this night. About four this affternoone, the King came hither with a great guard. He came to me and then went to the Dutch Castle, but did not tarry above a quarter of an houre, then came to our side, where wee had a long palaver to that purpose, that he did promise your Worshipps that his people should help to build the Castle, which he will doe, and tarry here himselfe alwayes, if your Worshipps will please to goe about it presently, and send workmen and souldiers, and great gunns to defend the place, because he heard that some of the Anntar people did say, if any Englishman came to settle here, they would kill every man, but if your Worshipps will please to send men and gunns aforesaid, he would take care of all pallavers, that none should interupt the building, and say he love no roagues pallavers, if he did he would goe to the Dutch. He added that when the Dankeryes fought the Doomes, that some of em went to Cabo Corso for shelter, and the Admirall delivered him [= them] to their enemies,97 and if the English would doe so any more, I should tell him off it, for he did not love to be deceived, to which I told him be need not feare, but your Worshipps would be reall to him in all you promised, [and he said] that when be sent heads by his cozen to Cabo Corso when he fought the Antas and beat them,98 and Mr Ronan put him in irons, which he took very ill, and that he would have Adoe taken out of the ring [which] he understood by Addico he had on, and that he would not have Amuffoe, which killed Mr Johnson,99 come here any more, but desire your Worshipps would send him to Barbadoes, or to the Royall Company in England, and tell them that was the man that killed one of their Cheifs at Succondee. If your Worshipps cannot doe one of these, he cannot live with the English more. He desires your Worshipps will write to the Generall of the Mina, that you have taken possession of the fort at Succondee. Th is is the import of the palaver, for I wrote in my pockquett book as twas told me. Part of the fort is fallen downe, and part is crackt, that it must be taken downe, and other part may be secured, but have not had time to examine it well, but will speedily and give your Worshipps a just accompt. PS. I have not yet had time to w1ite to Dickes Cove, but will before I sleepe. I cannot find where to have stones to build, but think the earth wiJl make good bricks, which will examine and give you an accompt. I doubt here will require a great expence of Liquors, therefore desire your Worshipps will please to end more by first, and a little Barbadoes rurnme for my selfe, here being nothing to be had for money. I desine Lo beginn clearing tomonow about the Castle. Nothing will attisfie em but the above w1itten, therefore humbly desire your Worshipps directions . I gave the King and Cheife Cabbosheers the caske of rumme your Worshipps ordered, and have spent patt [of] the other. 257. William Gabb Succondee, 27 April 1698 This comes humbly to acquaint your Worshipps that since my last have had several! pallavers with the King and Cheife Cabbosheers, and all end well, they promise thatt all their people shall doe any thing I sett them about. Yesterday some of the people found a faulcon gunn, 100 she seernes very good, in the grass neare the Dutch fort. I gott the Blacks to bring it on our side. I gave them a large dramm, but they desire some da hee of your Worshipps for itt. I perceive the others are .in this country, but cannot know till Sonday, neither will the[y] begin to work till then. Thi morning early the King sent to me and said a messenge r from a friend at Butterow tell him that the Generall of the Mina sent to one Jiem,101 brother to Ami.so that killed Mr John on, to demand twenty bendyes [which] he gave him to take the English fort here and cutt off the Cheifs head, but he not being able to pay it is commanded to mu ster up hi people to fight the Doomes and drive away the English againe from hence . The King saye he expects they will come, so I have prevailed with him and some Cabbo he rs to send for their forces, which will be here tomorrow , which was not to come till Sonday. All are very urgent to write presently to your Worshipps to desire white souldiers, powder, shott and some great guons with all speed to plant on the hill by the Castle, to be shelter if surprized and oblidged to retreat , which if your Worsbipps please to send I with their a sistance can presently runn up a swish wall round the Castle, which shall be suffitient to secure us till the other be in order. The _joyce in the vaulte 102 are very fitt for this place, if your Worshipps please to send with a carpenter, wee can be makeing things ready. So humbly desire.ing your Worshipp s derections . PS. The King gave the sheep l brought up to the white men that was killed in the Castle, 103 and his fetish tells him, if he doe not give one for the Castle, it will not doe well, so he desires one of your Worshipps. I have tryed the earth in severall places, and part of it will make good bricks. I sent the great canoe for Dick es Cove betimes a Monday, with an accompt of timber for this place. 104 The King and people will not lett me rest till I send this canoe, which I was unwilling to doe before received the other, but they urge the enemye will be speedily with us. Succondee , 3 May 1698258. William Gabb These comes humbly to acquaint your Worshipps I received yours of Aprill 26th with the caske runune. Worthy Sirs, I have endeavoured to know the minds of the King and Cabbosheer s, and they alwayes pl'Omise to assist with all their strenght to the building the fort, and that [they] try with the free consent of all that the English should now be settled in that fo11 againe, and if any enemie should endeavour to hinder or hurt any Englishman here, they would fight him to the utmost of their power. The King have had dealing with the Dutch some time since I have been here, butt he tells me if the English have goods here as he want he wil l never have to doe wit h them againe , and if they bring an enernie to hurt us here they will take their Castle. But Sonday being wett and Monday was the day to begin to work, they told me they would not build a house nore doe any thing, till your Worshipps had sent the things I wrote for last, and that your Worshipps promised to send the King seaven bendyes more, and that they had no provitions to eat, and if they worked they would be paid, unto which I told them they had promised your Worsh ipps to build the house, and to help build the Castle, and in aU their pallavers they had promised me the same, and thatt aU their men should doe any thing I sett them about, but if they would not doe every thjng they promi sed I had orders to take downe the flagg and begone , and that yom Worshipps was not so ill beloved but had all the country thereabouts at your command, and would take some other way to have the fort againe. Then the Cabbosheers told the King he must make the house and they would doe all they promised, which accordingly they sent their men for wood and have been at work this two dayes, and will finish itt in two or three more. They desire the gunns &ca wrote for, and the King desire your Worshipps to send him the seaven bendyes, and one bendy to buy the mens provitions while the fort is building. I have sent your Worshipp s a rnff [=ro ugh] draught of the old fort, and the dementions of the ground, and what addishions may be made if your Worshipp s think well of itt, and that the hill may be fortified with a ranpier [=rampart] and parrapett erected with earth, and doubt not but it will be of great use, which beleive your Worshipps will like well if itt was done. The earth by the Castle is good to make bricks, and here i no good stone to be digged in these parts. The earth will work the better to be digged now, and lye in the raine some time, and if your Worshipps please to have these thing done, here will want some of the laves that have made brick , and some that can speak English , to tell the people what they must doe, and some of your brick.layers, six or eight iron shovels , six pickaxes , two or three dozen crews 105 to carry earth, one grindstone. Pray please to send a carpenter with stuff to make a strong doore and doore case to the Castle, and as soone as can have stuff wee can be makeing things ready , which will soone be wanted when the bricklayers are at worke. Pray be plea ed to order the smith to make me some lock , to secure my things, for I loose somthing every day among t that crew. I shall want some old door or somthing to make one for the new house, some stong twine for lines. The thinmost of the planks that came in the great cano will make a carriage for the gunn here , if your Worshipps please to send [it] with trucks , I can gett axell trees here. Lime will be wanting before wee begin to work on the Castle. Here is wood enough to bume bricks and lime grow neare the fort. I have done what I can with these Jave to rowsaw and cleare about the fort, to make it fitt to worke. I humbly de ire your Worshipps will please to order me which way you like be t to goe on with the fort, and send whatt supplye your Worshipps can spare, and with Gods assi tance I will goe on with all the trength I have according to your orders . PS. I understand they have more bricks burnt at Dickes Cove then have occasion for, if your Worshipps please to order some here wee could be repairing part of the fort, before others can be ready. I humbly desire your Worshipps will please to order yom Steward to send me some provitions and some Barbadoes rum.me I wrote to him for. The King will not drink Portuguese rumrne but come to me every day for punch and a dram I had for my elfe, till I have none left, I find he love his belly well. If your Worshipps please to send a little come brandy 106 to humour his body, till the Fort i in good order, 1 will doe the best I can to mannage him. I humbly desire your Worships will please to send rowle [= roU) of tobaccoe, for the people goe to the Dutch for some . Abram, Bribbee, Quacoo and Affado and others at Commenda doe but break stone, others can doe there as well if your Worshipps please to send ome of them. There is a long ladder and a story ditto 107 may be spared there whi,ch will be wanted here. 259. William Gabb Succondee, 10 May 1698 Yom Worshipps received of the 7th instant, with the things therein mentioned, all but the barrels powder and long ladder from Commenda, which desire your Worshipps will please to order by the sloope. I gave the 12 perpetuanoes and sheep to the King &ca, and told em all you was pleased to order. They continue still they will stand fast to the English, and assist as before promised , but here are severall tempered 108 persons, and I perceive the Dutch employ all the instruments they can to obstruct us and infuse ill and absurd notion s in the King and peoples head s, so that yesterday wee had some crabbed 109 palavery, and they did insist that your Worshipps would not doe what you promised &ca, and because the powder, shott and great gunns was not come they was very uneasie, but I by Cabbosheer Quo told them the guuns was fixing and would be here in a few dayes with powder aod shott &ca. They was earnest for it, and that they might have some powder to be ready and I to have a store by me to supply em if the enemie come upon em . They say the Generali of the Mina have sent powder to the Antas to fight em here, and all they feare is they will come upon em when they are unprovided with powder and shott, and soe be oblidged to quitt this place, and urge that when the gunns are mounted at the Castle twill put a dread on the enemie , that they will not come near us. They desire more people here to work to hasten the finishing the Castle. I engag ed my life to em that your Worsh.ipps will assist em with all things necessary to carry on the building and be kind to them if the[y) fuJfiU all they have promised &ca. This morning all was very serene and all at work, and tomorrow will goe about our out fortification. I will lay out part this day and cleare to goe to worke. I humbly desire your Worshipps will please to tell me which way you like best for the inner fort, then Ile lay out that, which when tis done can the better contrive the outward, because of roome, and to make as Little work as possible. Just now the King told me they desire powder and gunns by a canoe if the sloop e was not neare. I have endeavoured to perswade em the canoes could not brin g the gunns, but they will not be well sattisfied till they come. The canoe men say they did not see a barrell powder. Worthy Sirs, here is a great expence of li.quors, the King and people desireing some every day, that I have spent one cask and one third of the other. I would with all my soul doe what your Worshipps please to order, and would not willingly doe any thing to deserve blame, therefore humbly desire your Worshipps directions. PS. The King desises you will send one woman hither, her name is Amquamboe, her husband dyed about a twelve month agoe in the Castle. If your Worshipps please to order two Black bricklayers more from Commenda wee could be prepareing earth for bricks and some lay the outside of our earth walls. Pray please to end some flints, one wonne for our smal I arm es, and two cattouc h boxes. Please to order the smith to make us three or four tone hammers and as many trowells, with ferrills [ = ferrules] to em about inch and . diame ter within and some three inches , and three inch and a haJfe bradds, [which ] wee want to make a door and lock to itt. 260.

The sloop and Gally arived here the 21, 110 and acording to your Worshipps orders sent the Gally to Dike Cove the ame day, and wrote to l'vlr Vincent for bricks and timber, 111 which wee much want. The currant setts so strong that she is nott two leagues off us. Wee gott all the gunns to the Castle this day, butt cannot mount them till tomorrow. I will ha ten the unloading the sloope. 112 The Captain desires the gunn wee found here , and would leave a bigger for itt, because the least is more convenient for him, if your Worshipps please itt shall be done. Last night one from the Mina told the King the Generali had ordered Little Taggee 113 to send his people to Buttrue to help Jenum the Antaiá to fight the Doomes, and must take the Eng li h Castle agai ne. They say the Dutch shipp that sailed by here the 22d was loaded with them. They aJ l came for powder and would not be denyed, for they had none to fight with. Addicoe said your Worshipps was pleased to tell him I mu t give the King and people some when they want itt, so I gave them four minion cart1idge full. I would have sold ome to them, butt they would nott then buy. The King swore all the Cabbosheers to stand true to the English , and would give your Worships eight marks of gold if he runn from the enemie as long as he live. If the enemie come upon us, l'le bee in as good order as possible to receive him, and if your Worshipps please to give the King orders and me leave to assist him, wee' l remove that unplaceable [= implacable] enemie the Dutch from Succondee , and Ile be cutt in peices before I'le surrender the Royall Companyes fort to them . The people here have been part imployed in building their houses, here not being above tenn when I first came here, and now is one hundred and forty. Some have work'd, and now they say wiJl send aJl the strength they have. Wee are about the earth walls, and as soone as possible wee'l at the bricks, and doe assure your Worshipps [I) will to the utmost of my power hasten the building, and obey all your Worshipps orde rs. This day our three two hand canoes goes out to fish, butt are nott returned. Cabbosheer Quo tells me they was affraid of this pallaver , and they have been disattisfied because I did nott give them canky money every day. I paid them all to the 11th instant, but wrote to Mr Homma to know if must pay them, 114 he gave me no answer and I was doubtfull your Worshipps would nott allow. I desire your Worshipps will please to send some [canoes?] here, the King being uneasie about their goeing away. Pray be pleased to send the things mentioned by the first. PS. Pray send one powder home for that is nott come [which] was sent; bolts for the three caJTyages, vizt four 13. inches to the eye, four 9 inches, two 15 and two 10 inches, the smith had the length; the old carryage that is at the work house, or bolts to the carryage of the gunn wee have here; 16 lines pins [=linchpins]; 115 a worme and ladles for the great gunns; some English and country match; a sheepe skinn and some spung nailes; one worme for small armes; 2 or 3 musquetts; one hour glass; 3 cattouch boxes; six iron shovells; three stone hammers; iron work for the grindstone; one large pair of hooks and hinges; 3 ordinary ditto; 2 padlocks and staples; 2 bolts and six staples, crook neck't; two or 3 hundred 3 inch and 3 inchl/2 brads;. hundred smallest spikes; one ball strong twine; one rabbett plaine [ = rabbit plane] the Captain forgott; l pair stilliards; one buckett and rope to draw water; one dozen more crows, better made, these are not well grnved; the moulds for bricks; some minion shott, here being none butt low minion and faulcon.

William Gabb This comes humbly to acquaint your Worshipps thatt since my last of the 23d instant, I see the pallaver is true that Little Taggee and Anters will fight us, which I did nott att first beleive, butt last night Little Taggee came in the bushes about halfe a league from us, and sent a lying pallaver to deceive the King and people, butt I used such arguments that prevailed with the King and people to look well out, which I did att the Castle. Wednesday morning a Dutch shipp came in thjs road, and is still here. This morning at daylight came about 20 two hand canoes, wee hear from the Mina, with four men armed in each, which posted to the Dutch Castle, where is all their towns people in armes . 116 Our King has been ill three dayes, this morning some carryed him to a croome about halfe a league from us. The King and Cabbosheers was earnest with me to goe aboard the sloope, when they went away and left me butt one Cabbosheer and three men, butt when saw my resolution nott to leave the Royall Company's fort, the King sent me three or four Capposheers with about 50 men. The[y] promised me to stand by us, and with Gods assistance [I] will to the utmost of my power rnaintaine the Royall Companys rites [=rights], and doe nott designe to quirt the Castle. I most humbly desire your Wor hips will consider us and please to direct. PS. The King and people say they will fight the enemies. Yesterday the Cabbosheers had a barren of powder. They were in a hurry butt promised to pay me this day. Wee have butt little come and cannott now gett any, pray please 10 send us some. Our four gunns are loaded but one has noe carryage. The Gally cannot gett from hence, I have sent to her to hall [ = haul] neer in to assist us. Please to send a ladle for our gunn á, some cartridge paper, needles and thread, rammer heads and brass wyer [ = wire]. I wish wee had more people to be revenged. 262. William Gabb Succondee, 30 May 1698 Your Worshipps of the 26 & 29th instant have received with the things therein mentioned. I thank God our enemje have nott yett attacked, tho' all continue att the Dutch Castle as in my last. The shipp likewise, and shee have sent near 20 white men and a great quantity of small armes to thatt Castle. Little Taggee marched back towards Shuma, but I hear is come this way againe. The King returned hither a Satterday, but brought butt a few men, and part I doubt are roagues. Sonday morning part of the women and some men went away, and others is at hott dispute, some complaining they had sent for their men and none came and was nott able to fight the enemie, some for geeing pre ently away. I sent Quo to reason with them butt to noe purpose. I went among them, they told me their people had nothing to eat, and they wanted the four bendye, if had nott would nott tarry. I used all po ible arguments till my souJe was weary. Att last I must lett them have one bendy or nothing to be done, which I did unwillingly doe and did not leave my elfe halfe an ounce. This day about twelve or fourteen more went, they ay to call more from the croomes. I continually urge them to call their people in a body, for now was the time to gaine the favour of your Worshipps. They always promise well but doe nott perlorme accordingly . This day the King must have two sheets for the fetish, or else the Castle would be taken, which I gave them. Your Worshipps being pleased to order recruits to us, doe mightily annimate my spiritts. I hope they will stand true, and I fear none of them, but hope to putt things in better order among us here. I have nott spared to labour day and night with head and hands to gett all things in readiness, and the best order as po sible could, and doe keep a strict watch in the night, and will to the utmo t of my power doe all I can for my ma ters intrest. PS. Will take care to give your Worshipps a just accompt how all things sent are expended. The King desire the two gunns at Dickes Cove Lo be sent here, and the 3 women thatt came from thence. Adclico told me just now that some of them was saying if the 3 women was nott sent here they could not have any thing to doe with the English. Have sent Adclicoe that your Worships may please to examine him. I find some are roagucs butt cannott find who is the cheifest. They desire your Worships will ask the Generali of the Mina why he sent Little Taggee to trouble them, and another thing they would have me write to trouble you, as Addicoe heard, they desire the money mentioned. T long to see the recruits before wee are sett upon. Please Losend some more small shott; the King and people had part what I had. They have nott yctt paid for the barrell powder, Quo tells me they hope your Worshipps will give itt them. Pray please to send some canoes. Please to send me a little paper, having none to write. 117
