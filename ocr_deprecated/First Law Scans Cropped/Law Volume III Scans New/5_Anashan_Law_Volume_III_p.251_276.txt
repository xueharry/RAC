V ANASHAN Anashan (' Annishan'), nowadays called Bi_riwa,i 9 km east of Cape Coa t. The RAC had re-established its factory here, following a period of abandonment, in 1687,1 but it was evacuated in early 1691, hortly before the Rawlinson correspondence resume .2 The factory was reoccupied in fane 1692, a related in this correspondence, but again abandoned in May 1695. It had again been re-established , however, by the beginning of 1699. The Anashan factory was not fortified, being described in 1694 only a 'a thatch'd house' .3 In this period, Ana han was mainly important as a supplier of corn, to provision slave ship ; only small amounts of gold seem to have been obtained, and small numbers of slaves . The hinterland traders supplying gold to Anashan in the 1680s had been the Akani ('Arcany ' ), and they are till mentioned in this role in 1695 (no. 582) . Anashan Jay within the country of Fante ('Fanteen'); hence the factory paid 'custom' to the 'Braffo' , the head of the Fante state, a well as to local 'Cabosheer ' (nos 526 etc.). 4 The correspondence from Anashan makes some reference to Fante foreign relations, notably a war again t 'Cabess Terra' (Etsi), to the n01th, in 1693-4 (nos 549 etc.), and the sending of forces to intervene in the Komenda war of 1695 (no. 585). Mention i also made of a projected war between the neighbouring states of Asebu ('Saboe') and Fetu ('Futu'), to the west , in 1692 (no. 530). 509.

I asked them how much, they replyed 7 pease , o after some arguments past I told them in short that they [ = I] would allowe them no more then what they had received, and that if they were not atisfyed therewith the Factory must remaine unresettled , to which they aid they would goe or send to you towards Christmas, and if you will alowe nothing they mu t be content, in the mean time by my de ire it may be settled imediatly , promiseing that the persone you send shall in no wayes be troubled about it, but that they will refere them elve wholy to you, which if you pleas to credit may ettle as soon as hall think convenient, it being now or near as much repaired as the neccesarie will alowe.

They demand the value of goods which Mr Mel.ross gave them. Likewise the Braffo &ca [demand) their dues, you may see by Melross accompt what they were, the same value in goods by me will satisfy them both. Pray send me word what quantity of come you would have me buy, likewise the prizes of slaves. I could gett much more come had I the goods they want, which are fine sletias and plains. I desired a baill of plains in my last. If yon have any fine sletias pray send one case with the plains and ane iron crow, pickax and a shod shovell21 and a come shovel! on accompt of the Royall African Company of England and would be very necessary here. 527.

Mr Melross wilJ informe you I can keep come for some time with great care.

When I op[e)ned the boysadoes I found. of them damaged, some more some lesse, .likewise a great many of the Welch plains, pray order somebody to view them that the damaged may be valued and be ready for the traders again[st) they come. I am sorrie the come I sent should not bold measure, when it was measured by the same chest my predicessors made use of, which I sent to Cabo Corso with the come, and have of the same size by me, which was not found fault withall in his time, but I am afrayed there was some juggle played by the canoemen, one of them see it measured as they always doe. I hope for the future if any come to be wanting youll make them make it good, and not me pay twi.ce over. If you please to give the smith leave he will make a shovel, pickaxe and iron crow for the factory, which canot be without, likewise 200 naills to naill the matts round the bottom of the come room and up against the sides of the wall.

I am veny well saisfyed they had such measure of me as would hold out with that at Cabo Corso, the chest being the same size as that which use to give content at Cabo Corso. Both the souldiers and canoemen see it all measured, if they play the rogue among themselves I carrot help it. Any of them that have a mind to be a rogue may leave two or 3 basketts at any rogues house when they carry it down to the canoe from the Factory, for I take no further care of it affter I have delivered full measure to them.

Thomas Smith Annishan, 29 July 1693 This day [I] was show ne per my boy and Alther Coner the Black man I bought my sheep and lambs off, and accordingly sent for Coffee that he might see him liveing in the town, in hopes l should have some redress. The slave Herente s that liveth at this factory brought that man to me that sold me the sheepe, and he denies that to be the man that Arther Comer and my boy testifies to be the same, he haveing given him some small matter to deny it, and Coffie instead of redressing me was going to knock the boy to the ground with a great stick for justifieing the truth, and [my] indevering to hinder him put him into a great passion against me, that he gave me several blows on the face, which I never expected nor deserved from his hands. He brought all the town about me, and for my satisffaction of demanding right of the man I bought the sheep off [I] was very much beaten and almost hald [= hauled] to peece s amongst them, not suffering me to enter into the factory, but still as I endeavered to goe that way was ma[u]led and beaten by them sufficiently , being all I can expect from them except some other course be taken with them, for Coffee countenances all rogues in whatever action they comit. This town is wholy a herber [= harbour] for them, Coffee being their head is the reason no trade comes to this factory, for they panyar all straingers and others that are not their gang, and bring s false pallavers on them, which frightnes all people from coming near this place. They have played so many roguish actions with Saboe people that all goe to Annimaboe, fearing to come here. I have agreed with the people very well ever since I came here, till I came to pre s upon their franchies [= franchi e]28 as being rogue , to have my selfe righted by some honest means, whjch they are alltogether strajnger s to, and will no way Jose their privelidge to make satisfaction for my wrongs, cheat & abuses dooe by them, being upheld by Coffee their Captain. [PS] Thi was wrott and seale d being befor e Han ssico came down here , intending to send it tomorrow from Anni[m]aboe, by reason I have no boy to carry it from hence. Coffee and my selfe should agree very well if it were not for rogues harbouring here. I desire leave till Wednesday or Thirsday next at furthest before I send this months accompts, by which time I hope to give you a full accornpt of the come I am to buy. I hope you will give more credite to me then you will to Hansaco, who is Coffees great friend and will tell you a faire story in hjs favour, maybe to my prejudice. 538. Thomas Smith Annishan Factory, 3 Aug. 1693 By the bearer have sent you my last months accompts in which are the first of the come you ordered me to purchase. If you want 40 or 50 chests come can procure them by Tewesday next, which [if] you have occasion for, pray dispatch the messinger with all convenient speed, that I may have the more time to comply with your desires. 539. Thomas Smith Annishan Factory, 4 Aug. 1693 I makeing a small mistake in my accompts, which I found out as soon as the messinger was gone from me, I sent one after him to bring him againe, which I have now returned by this bearer. I was in hopes by this time to have received orders to propose my selfe for Whydah (haveing a little bussiness to settle at Cabo Corso Castle [&]ca). If I was there I believe T can do as much for the Companys interist as any you can propose to send. It is in your power to do what you please, I again humbly request to be sent there as Chief, hoping you willnot place any one over my head, since I desire to goe for Whydah .29 To my knowledge I never deserved the ill will of any persons in the government, but have endevored to carry my selfe fairly and justly to aU persons, whatever bac[k]biters may say of me to the contrary, which they cannot justifie to my face. 540. Thomas Smith Annishan Factory, 7 Aug. 1693 Yours I received on the 4th & 5th instant, and had answered the former but my accompts &c were gone before it came to hand. I have sent by the bearer a sample of come I have purchased on the Royall Companys accompt, taken this morning as it rises out of the come roomes. The person that informed you I took in noe come told you halfe his story, as I believe he did the same concerning the affront and injury done me by Coffee, which you take no more notice off then done to a dog, when I thought you would have branded him for taking part with unjust Negroes when they do injuries to the Royall Companys factors. You are to apt (as doth appear) to give creditt to an notorious lying Negroe, who is publicklie known to be such, then to a factor, which is the reason hath made you transffer Abington law to Cape Coast.30 I have carefully perused the coppy of the letter sent you on the 4th instant, wherein I find nothing worthy of reproofe. I thank God I am my selfe now and was not at that time as much in my senses as usually. I am very sensible who I write to and what I writt. There are no reflections in my last on any perticu ler person, not one word tending towards heat or passion (however you may represent it), nothing but what is civill and modest and with submiss ion and would have been so taken by any wise and discreet men, but what can I expect from persons prepossest with an ill opinion of me without any cause or reason? 541. Thomas Smith Annisha n factory, 4 Sept. 1693 By the bearer have sent my August accompts. I have not taken one era era since I came from Cabo Corso Castle. Captaine Curtis31 and lngerham his trustee liked the come I had by me on the Companys accompt so well that they both said better come could no man desire, and if they had no wors[e] desired no better to take aboard ship. 542. Thomas Smith Annishan factory, 18 Sept. 1693 The wood you ordered me to be cutt is now ready. If you please when you send the canoe for it to send me on accompt of the Roya]! Affrycan Company of England four or six chests of sheetes with 10 cases spe1itts. I could sold most of the perpetuanoes at 10an per perpetuano, they will not give any more. 543. Thomas Sm.ith Anishan factory, 19 Sept. 1693 Yours I received and have according to your order sent you fifty sticks of wood for handspikes on accompt of the Royal] Affrican Company of England. 544. Thomas Smith [Anishan Factory), 2 Oct. 1693 I have by the bearer sent my September accompts, & have delivered the 10 barrels of gunpowder sent here the 29th of the last month according to your orders to the person that brought your note for the same. If you have any blew Welsh plains (the next time you send a canoe down into these parts) pray send one bale on accompt of the Royall African Company of England. Here is no trade nor likely to be any as I see as yet, only for come, which they are willing to part withall for goods & may be had for 11/2an per chest. If you think convenient can purchase what you please to order me. 545. Thomas Smith Annishan factory, 7 Oct. 1693 This morning the people of this town seized 15peeses perpe tuanoes going from Mr Edward Searle, Chiefe of Annimaboe, to Cabo Corso to be sold there on the said Mr Searles private and proper accornpt, as I were informed by persons that were carrying of them to Cabo Corso. The perpetuanoes wiJI be keept in the town untill they know your pleasures what shaU be done with them, being pretty well assured that they do not belong to the Royall Company. Pray be pleased dispatch some orders about them. 32 546. Thomas Smith Annishan factory, 9 Oct. 1693 Yours I received of yesterdays date, & had senl an answer last night if I could have gott aU the perpetuanoes into my costody, there being two still remaining in the hands of one Quacoone, a surly, doged, morosse, willfull feUow, he demanding 5 peezes in gold before he parts with them, saying that Arnbo at Cabo Corso is so much indebted to him, he will keep them for satisfaction of that debt. Coffee underhand perswaids him to it, who is the author, continuer, promoter and upholder of all villanys &c that are acted in this town, thoug[h] he will not be openly seen in any thing, and yet [is] the head of all mischeif, perpetualy brooding and hatching the same, for I have made it part of my business of late to dive into his actions and his canting way of managing intreagues, who wipes his mouth and sayes he does nothing, who is a perfect [word illegible) of villiney. I had 11 perpetuanoes from Coffee, who makes demand of debts owing to him from persons liveing at Cabo Corso, and expects satisfaction before I pa1t with the perpetuanoes, if not he expects the debts to be paid by me. He sayes Quo belonging to Hansicoe owes him a bendy, and one Odi belonging to Amoe llan , and another lOan but cannot tell me his name. It plainly appears that these perpetuanoes were not seized to serve the Royall Company but their own private ends, which l hope will be converted to the Royall Company advantage thoug[h] not designed so when taken, being done illegally and contrary to the laws and customs of their own countrey to take white mens goods to pay black mens debts, where there is dayly people coming to and through this town from Cabo Corso, and if any such sums of money be owing they are to act accordingly to their own country laws by seizing such persons as come from thence or live at Cabo Corso, and not whit mans goods who owe them nothing, therefore I looke upon this as an intreague of Coffees to gett the best pait of the two perpetuanoes for himselfe , and if suffered to goe on in their severall illegall wayes and practices without being branded there will be no liveing here for any person, Coffee being more insolent and open [in] his affaires then usually, and tell me to my face the Gentlemen at Cabo Corso do not love me in my souldiers hearing , upon whjch he presume s to act as he pleases, though I endeavour to carry all faire with him and shall not find fault without a cause. Coffee is not to be perswaided upon any termes to go up to Cabo Corso . If you have a mjnd to speake with him Hansicoe at Cabo Corso must be the man to perswaid him to go up or nobody. I send the aforementioned not[e] to Jett you understand how a:ffaires are managed here, & leave all to your judgement to act as you shall see cau se & think convenient, no wayes doubting your kindne . PS. Searles boy Hansico being now at Cabo Corso , can tell you the persons that were carrying the goods to Cabo Corso . 547. Thomas Smith Anni han Factory , 28 Oct. 1693 1 have sent by the bearer a young women slave on accompt of the Royall African Company of England.
