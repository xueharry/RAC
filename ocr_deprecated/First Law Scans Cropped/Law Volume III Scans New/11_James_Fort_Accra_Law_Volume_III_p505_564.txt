XI JAMES FORT, ACCRA Accra, nowaday the capital of Ghana, is 110 km east of Cape Coast. The RAC's establishment here, Jam.es Fort, had been founded in the 1670s and occupied continuou ly since then. Accra had been conquered by the inland kingdom of Akwamu ('Quamboe', etc.) in 1680, and remained subject to the latter through the 1690s.1 The king who had effected this conquest, Ansa Sasraku ('Ahenisah'), had died in 1689, and Akwamu was now ruled jointly by his brother, called 'Bas ua' or 'Bansiar ' in Dutch and Danish sources (this name occurring in the correspondence from James Fort in the fo1m 'Bonisha' or 'Bonishee'), 2 and his heir apparent, Ado ('Addo').3 There were also a Dutch fort (Fort Crevecoeur) and a Danish fort (Christiansborg) in Accra, to which reference is made in this correspondence. The Danish fort was seized by Akwamu forces in 1693, but ransomed back to the Dane a year later; the seizure occurred during a hiatus in the Rawlinson conespondence, but its restoration to the Danes (in June 1694) is noted (no.1243). Accra supplied both gold and slaves (and al o corn and oystershells). In the early 1680s, the main supply of gold to Accra came from Akani and Akyem ('Akim' etc.), in the interior beyond Akwamu, but by the 1690s Akani traders were no longer coming to Accra,4 and trade from Akyem was also frequently di rupted by disputes with Akwamu.5 The supply of laves, on the other hand, derived mainly from Akwamu's own military operations, and wa therefore more secure; in this period Accra was thought to be supplying as many laves as the rest of the Gold Coast combined.6 However, the operation of the trade was subject to the vicissitudes of King Basua's policy, with frequent interdictions of dealings with the European forts.7 The correspondence alludes to internal tensions within Ak:wamu, between its two co-rnlers, which on one occasion, in 1693, came to the brink of civil war (no.1222). It also refers to Ak"Wamu's continuing mijjtary enterprises against neighbouring countries. Repeatedly during the 1690s, forces were dispatched to fight 'to leeward', i.e. along the coast to the east. Most of these campaigns seem to have been directed against the Adangme ('Allampo'), between Accra and the River Volta;8 but on other occasions Akwamu forces operated east of the Volta, in alliance with the rising power of 'Little Popo', in 1692-3 against Whydah (nos 1205 etc.), and in 1695 apparently against Anlo (no.1294). The co1Tespondence also documents a campaign against Kyerepon ('Accrippoone'), in the interior to the east of Akwamu in 1697 (no.1317). There were also persistent tensions with Akyem, with repeated rumours of the imminence of attack by the latter between 1694-7, though no serious fighting occurred <luting the period of this correspondence.9 1183. M.B. Whiteing James Fort, Accra, Tuesday, 12 May 1691 Yours of the 6t1'instant per the Aligator SJoope with all the perticulars therein mentioned came safe to my hand, except the bay le no.273 which you say should containe 29 green plaines made out but 20 pieces. I must also informe you that amongst some of the bayles of blue perpetuanoes, with the blues wee have found severall redd, how to rectifie that I know not. The knives will not goe at 8 per la but at 10, as you directed per the first supply of the sloope, neither will they give Sa per umbanees and 12a per peice of long cloth, as to the other goods I have brought them to compliance. Corne here is none to be had, neither good nor bad, I am forced to send my Bumboy to waylay the Quambooers, to force them to bring the litle that comes downe to supply my occations. Our trade is at present stopt, by reason our best traders under the command of Aheni[s]ah[s] cousin Ado 10 are gon to fight to leeward, which occationed a stoppage also to the leeward trade. tJ I wrote to you in my last for several] materialls wanting, I received nothing in answer. This was intended you some day agoe, but my indisposition which hath held me this nine dayes with a violent feavor hindered my intent. lnclosed goes my Aprill accompt and ballance amounting to 14mk 3oz 3a, which you will receive per bearer.

Whiteing Accra , Wednesday, 24 June 1691 Yours of the 18th instant came safe to hand with box of books and accompts, which according to your direction I put on board the Kendall Friggott, as per inclosed receipt appeares.

Mr Samuell Humfryes went hence yesterday morning. 16 Wee are extreemly in want of mawles, iron wedges, pick axes, and iron crow, to break stones to finish the p]attforms towards the sea, which will be a great security to the Fort when done. The matterials formerly sent [ms. 'some'] are all broacken. Wee want also some palme oyle. Negroes are scarce, advise what quantity you will have me purchase and in what time. 1188. Marcus Bedford Whiteing James Fort, Accraa, 4 July 1691 Thi s is no more than to accompany Mr Lang by the 2 hand canoe you sent downe expressly for bim. I suppose you have by this time notiss that Mr Niccolis Pepperell was forced to tbjs place for want of water and provitions, which now he hath sufficient to bring him up. 17 I have also put on board him 16 butts of oystershells for ballase (= ballast]. This night he intends to make the best of his way to your parts. On board hirn goes also one Bryan , who left the Portugueeze which the East India Merchant brought downe.

Mark Bedford Whiting Accraa, Tuesday, 11 Aug. 1691 Yours of the 31st past came to hand by the hipp Supply, Capt. James La hly, by whome I have received all the Company' effects you mentioned in the said letter. Slave I have none. The scarcity of come in these leward parts prevented my answering what you directed. What elce you ordered, I shall be asured to follow. This had been with you sooner had not I been much out of order with the gripes. By the bearer have sent you l l mk 2oz 3a 3ta. Our trade has been much decreased of late, by reason our best traderes are gone down to fight a place on this side the River of Vulter.20 The aforesaid summe is the ballance of July accompt, as per ditto inclosed accompt appears. The iron work sent downe last being not work[ed) well togeather, is broken in peces especially, neither where they halfe bigg enought for our use, wee have had little or no service out of them, as also the iron wedges. [PSl Mr Jefcreyes in the Alligater sloop is now at Lague. 1194. M.B. Whiting James Fort. Accraa, 3 Sept. 1691 This comes on purpose to desire a supply of sheets, perpe tuanoes blue & read, some seyes, lead barrs, and saccerguntes. The herba longees that came last are not good collours, sundreys worme eaten, which came by the ship Supply, James Lashly Commander, who whent from hence for Arda the 14th past.21 I am sorry my accompts cannot be made up to accompany this canoe, the cause is being retar[d]ed by extream sickness & gripeings, which has taken away the use of both my hands, my right especially. Wee are extrcamly in whant of a carpenter, which makes things run very much to ruin, formerly you writt I might be suplied with such a man from you when desired. The iron work sent last is all broken to peices, so that wee are at present in as much want as before. Postscript. I had allmost forgott to informe you that Serjeant Cole was left behind in a miserable condition, but now I hope he may doe well. This may also advice you that JohnSherwin, souldier, through misery of the French pox,22 wbich continually attended him, through his daly debauchery, though our Doctor often warned him to the contrary, hanged himself in his bed to end his miserable life. 1195. M.B . Whiting Accraa, 17 Sept. 1691 This accompanyes the Allegator Sloop, Mr Leonared Jeffereys master, by whome I rece ived all the goods you sent by her. By the same conveyance goes no oyster shells, by reason could not gelt any in a readiness, you may expect some per the next. 1196. M.B. Whiting James Fort, Accraa, 10 Oct. 1691 Yours of the 9th instant came safe to hand with the inclosed coppy from the Royall African Company, both which I have perused. This per rcturne of the same canoe, & in complya ncc of your orders my endeavor shall not be wanting to purchase what slaves presents that are good. Wee are in dayly expectation of the rclume of the Quamboer s which went downe to fight to leeward, & that slaves may be then more plently then now. By this conveyance you will receive what irons and rings for long irons wee have that are out of order for want of bolts, which I desire may be fixt & sent per the sloope. If we should meet with slaves, we should want them, the good ones wee have are but few. I wrote you last Tuesday expresly for some goods & materials. 23 I must also desire you send what i neccessary for a strong doare case for the plattforme. I am sorry for the lose of the Guinea Friggatt & lose of the accompts sent by her, 24 and lhen it is out of my power at present to wtitt over my accompts again, being so disabled by the weakness of my hands, the right e 'petially, and Mr William Cooper verry ill of the gripe which came upon him yesterday, that o I am at present without assistance and unable to answer the Companys order as to that matter, unless you can spaire me sombody from your parts that can writte a pa sable hand, I shall not be wanting to give him direction. Our place is destitute of uch a man, unless it be Serjeant Cole, whos at present not much better in his limbs then my self. My last two months accompts are finished, but want some per on to writt them faire, as for my part I am ashamed to put pen to paper, & doubt much if you can make any thing of this letter, which I hope you will impute to my weakness. [PS] Wee shall want mallagata and palm oyle for lave use. The rings for other irons and long irons are in all 54, send us also some reveets [= rivets] & forelocks, 25 we have none for the irons. Omitted in my last some paper brawles, which pray send also. 1197. M.B. Whiting Accraa, 17 Oct. 1691 Yours of the 151" instant came safe to hand per the Allegater sloope, Mr Leonard Jefferyes master. The goods sent by him are not as yett ashoare, per next shall acknowledge the receipt. Thi was intended you yesterday, but the said loope appearing in the evening prevented me. This also accompanies the baUance of my August & September accompts amounting 56mk 0oz 5a 2ta, which you will receive per bearer. The accompts by reason of Mr William Cooper[s] indisposition, who is now in a mending hand, shall I hope in a few dayes be written faire in order to be sent to you . I am also I thank God much better then I was, haveing recovered more strength in my limbs within this 8 dayes then a month before, as to my health I never was better. Pray advise per next wither I must pay any wages to Coale, if any how much & from what time. I wrote you for some nailes of all sorts, I understand not any to be sent per the sloop, nor revetts or forelocks for the irons. As soon as the goods are landed the said vessell shall returne to you with oystershells. You have also omitted a strong lock for the platfonne doore. [PS] Send us a few trowells for the brickla[y]ers &ca. There is no tooles wo1th anything for carpenters use, nor no nailes. 1198. M.B. Whiting James Fort, Accraa, 30 Oct. 1691 Yours of the 27th instant I have before me and have received the carpen.ters tooles, nailes, hammers , trowells &ca. This accompanys my August & September accompts, which had been with you some days before had I not met the hard fortune againe on Munday last to be taken with my late distemper insomuch that I am in the same condition & disabled as before. The 26th instant went hence the Allegater sloope , Mr Leonard Jefferyes commander , by whome have returned you cases containing fourty damaged sayes of which 1 formerly advised you came downe in that condition per the same conveyance. By her have sent no oyestershells, by reason tha[t] the Negroes not complying to measure them with the butt you sent last for that use, neither would they be sattisfied to the contrary that the sloope would not goe without them, since her departure have complyed , & wee are now measuring them against next oppe1tunity. George Cole went in the sloope. 1199. M.B. Whiting James Fort, Accra, 16 Nov. 1691 I have had none from you to answere, no more then yours of the 15 past which come per the Allegater sloope with all the goods therein mentioned. This per express is to accompany 30rnk of gold, the baUance of my October accompt, being at present unfinished by reason of the loss of the use of my hands, and Mr Cooper sick of the gripes, that I am present destitute of assistance, being forced to make use of the Doctor to write you this letter, yet thank God I never was better in health. The carpinter sent down last per ditto sloope died the last Satterday of a feavour & flux. We have here a Deans souldier, who is a verry good workman that can supply the vacancy if you please to allow him carpinters pay, wee cannot be supplyed with a better. The iron mawles you sent, by reason of their smallnesse & the iron not well worked together, are all broken, with some of the wedges, so that wee want others in their roome, not forgetting two or three iron shovel ls which wee want much. The quantity of sheets sent last are all disposed, you may supply us with more, as also iron barrs, brawles, pautkies green , blue Welch plaines & green perpetuanoes. As to the other goods wanting, not knowing what sorts are remayning by you I can say nothing to it at present. The sattins received last are much damaged & bad coulours in [ms. 'is'] somuch that they will not vend, one of the 20 peices proved to be but half made, being no more then 4 fatham whereas it should be 8. I wrote you last for strong lock for the platforme doore , which I hope you will send per next. By the loop went two case containing 40 damaged saye . The neger have complyed with the measure, so that the oy ter hells are ready for the sloope. 1200. M.B. Whiting James Fort, Accra, * Dec . 1691 Yours of the 24th past per the Alligator Sloop I have received with all the good therein mentioned. I perceive that you have not paper brawles nor iron barrs, by reason none wa ent per the same conveyance, neither did wee receive any iron shovels, the want of which has made us omething tedious in lading the sloope, the Negroes being forced to tak up the shell with their hands , and likewise the white men from the canoe aboard the sloope . I humbly desire that three or four may be sent per returne of this canoe, as al o 3 or 4 iron mawles & wedges , with a á many deale boards as will fix a new five hand canoe .26 Wee are also much in want of a grapli.ng & rope for the canoe s upon occation . The lock for the platfforme dare we have received, but no staples to hang it on. According to your orders I have inspect d my last Augu t accompt, wherein I find the error of the 6 chests come, which I wi Il make good in the October accompt. As to the error of the ninety sheets as you say in September, I find no such thing in the accompt remayning by me, so humbly desire that the ame accompt may be sent per bearer, that so if not right I may rectifye it, you may be assured shall be returned per first with the accorupt and ballance , not a y tt finished by reason of my lamen ess , which make me still uncapable to put my pen to paper. The Company lave the blacksmith by name Odan is now at Aquamboe under the protection of Bo11isha, to whome I have sent expressly to demand him, but by reason that the Braffo of Fanteen haveing received two men Jave from the smith brother for his freedome Bonisba will not deliver him, but desires you to send to the Braffo to know the certainty of th.is buisines . The other m.ith is at Anguina. Advi e me what to doe about them. 1201. M.B. Whiting James For t, Accra, 18 Dec. 1691 This by a canoe bound to Annamaboe is to advise you that the Altigater sloope went from hence this morning with 35 butts of oyster hell . In my last I wrote you for a grapling and rope for the canoes upon occation, which if any you may send per returne of this conveyance. Mr William Cooper is still sick of the gripes, and my elf as yet uncapable of putting pen to paper, so that occatio ns my accompt to be behind hand . 1202. M.B. Whiting James Fort, Accraa, J8 Dec. I 691 By the sloope goes thi11y five butts of shells. 1203. M.B.

In complyance to the said letter I intend God willing to embarque in a seaven hand canoe tomorrow, in order to be present at the opening of the said pacquet.27 1204.

By the Aligator sloope I have received l 90 gallons rum on accompt of the Royall African Company of England. Their are 10 gallons marked [= leaked?] out of one of the casks, as Mr Jeffryes can witnesse. Charles Anderso ne, one of our men, is dead, his concerns will not pay his debts. By this 2 hand canoe I have sent my March and Aprill accompts, and for ballance of the former mkl 2oz I la 4ta, and for the latter mk9 2o 3a I. ta on accompt of the Royall Company of England.

The late tornadoe s haveing blown half the sloops mainsaill away, which Mr Jeffrys does patch up as well as he can, and will sail per first opportunity, we have ladden 30 butts of shells in her. No news but that Affere and part of the Quambures are going to fight to leeward.28 If Captain Quo remaine at Cabo Corso, here is John Brafoy who desires he may be intertained in the Com.panjes service, he is a very neci arie man in the absence of Captain Quo.29 1206.

John Bloome James Fort, Accra, 14 June 1692 Some dayes agoe the Deans sent a Factor with goods to Barracow, of which I have notice. I sent Mr David Gualtier to c!aime the right due to the Royall African Company of England. 34 The natives are werry well satisfyed therewith and desire they may be furnished with some goods such as their occasions do require and in such cace no other nation shall come there , and the Dean is since departed, theirfor I shall send some small matter to supply them at the easiest charge possible.

Our Doctor has sent what he can spare. The King of Quambo has stop all trade from the 3 forts. I sent to him to know the reasone, and for answer he said he would have all s01ts of goods at the same rates as were sould in King Ahenneshans time. I have represented to him the great charge the Company is at in send[ing] of goods to Guinea, but he wont understand it. I hope in a few dayes we shall put an end to his unreasonable demands. I am heartily sorry that you are both so ill, I pray God give you health, for a man has but little comfort while he labours under sicknese. By this conveyance r have sent my May accompts and for balance mk.3 0o 4a 2ta, for which please give me eredite. [PS] We shall have little or no baJlance this month. 1210.

For upwards of these two years have I remained a second in this place, much longer then any before me have, and my 3 years contract with the Royall African Company draues neer end, which makes me thus desireous of removeall. May your Honours please to grant this request, I shall ever pray for your Honours health and prosperity. 1214. John Bloome James Fort, Accra, 10 Oct. 1692 I have herewith sent you my August accompt, wherein I have entred Captain Brabay in liew of Captain Quo. We have no ballance for our September accompt last, nor have we any trade, all this country people being gone to fight the King of Whydah.4 t I have had a verie severe relaps of a feaver, which has weakned me and reduced me to a shadow. Mr Cooper has had the gripes, but now on recovery. 1215. John Bloome James Fort , Accra, 15 Oct. 1692 By this conveyance Mr William Cooper has taken his passage according to your orders. 42 1216. John Bloome James Fort, Accra, 9 Nov. 1692 Herewith I send my September & October accompts, and for ballance of the latter 2o 8a lOta of gold, for the former there is no ballance. I am as sorry as you can be that our trade is so bade , but what is yett worse its like to containow so as long as the warr holds. I hope you don't impute it a fault in me for I do asure you I had no hand in the warrs, nor shall I have more for makeing peace, for the King of Quamboe is resolved to go through with it. A little patiance may bring great things to pass, but what [blank] me in the meanwhill is that our neighbours43 to participate in the same misfortune. 1217. John Bloome James Fort, Accra, 11 Dec. 1692 This goes by Monsieur Gasper Martenan, per whom I have sent my November accompts and for ballance mk3 2oz 15a Sta gold. Here is little trade, and the Quambore s have sent more men to fight Whydah, 44 so that in all likelyhood the wans will still containow. 1218. John Bloome James Fort, Accra, 10 Jan. 1692/3 11th My last was per Mon sieur Martenan the ultimo , per whome I sent my November accompts and for ballance mk3 2oz 15a Sta gold. This is for con.veyance of my December accompts and balance, being mk4-12a 6ta gold. I suppose you hav.e heard of the disorders at Whydah, and since we are informed that the Quamboers and confederats have taken the King of Whyda h prisoner, but that wiLI want a confirmation. 45 However there are no slaves to be bought at Whydah, and therefor the Dutch do designe to sla ve their great ship with Gold Coast Negroes, and for that purpose they do buy all they can att Accra and elcewhere. 46 If you judge it neci ssary we may buy some also, for in all probability Negroes will be scarce in all places. 1219. John Bloome James Fort , Accra, 9 Feb. 1692/3 By the bearer I have sent my January accompt & for ballance mk3 lo 14a of gold. We hear that there are 2 or 3 of the Royall Company ship arrived , therefor Jdesire you to send us as oon as possible a quantity of sheets, alejars , tapseils, brawles, one pound pewter ba on , iron barrs, pautk:ies white, knives, per.petuanoes blue and green, powder. [gap in conespondence, mid-Feb. to July 1693]47 1220. John Bloome James Fort , Accra , 3 Aug. 1693 This accompanys my July accompt and ballance , being six marks six ounces twelve angles and one taccoe of gold , which please to pass to my credit. I have also sent you a bulce containing 3oz 7an of gold , the estate of John Webb deceased. I have sent sundry times to the King of Quamboe about the delivery of the Dane fort, and he has allwayes sent me fair promises , but of late the Dutch second hath been there to solicite for their releasement 48 and to contract for the Castle, he carried great presents with him, and gott the two Danes which were there.49 The General [i.e. of the Danes] and the rest are yet at the Danes Town, 50 and I have sent also to remember him of his prorni e and to desire him to come to capitulation51 about the Castle. When I have his answer baJIadvise you. I shall gett in 300 chests come but I cant tell as yett whether or no I may procure any more. Be pleased to Jett us have a speedy supply of sheets, brawles & some cases of sperritts as soon as you can , after that tl1eshipps may bring what cant be sent at present. 1221. John Bloome James Fort, Accra, 9 Sept. 1693 Your sundry letters in August last I received in due time . By the retume of the canoe which brought yours of the 13 June I sent the bell which I charged in my accompts, and since I find the canoe wa sent from Winnebah with the said litter [= letter], therefore I judge that the bell i [in] custody of the party that sent it.52 By Capt. Bradshaw 53 I received the sundry good sent me as per your letter 21sl August, and he made the best of hi way to Amersa for shell , for we have none here. Inclosed you have receipts for the come &c, and 24 men, 20 women shipped per Capt. Funnell and Capt. Curtis .54 They would not give me bills of lading for the slaves, therefore was forced to take receipts, one of each I have forwarded according to your orders. Capt. Funnel has taken no come here, he haveing provisions enough as he told me. The Kinge of Quamboa will not dispose of the Danes fort yet, but himself and [the) Cabbosheer the black Governor of the fort55 and all the people of the Danes Towne do promise that (it] shall never fall into other hands but the English, and I doe realy believe them, but how long it may be first I doe not know.56 They have a great trade with Dutch interlopers, which they find so profitable that I doubt they will not easily part with the fort, in a few months we shall see what they resolve upon. If they keep the fort it will be a notable prejudice to our factory. The Kinge of Quamboe sent his cosen some time agoe to deliver me three of the Danes, and the black copeman was comeing to deliver me the Generali and three men more, but approaching the Dutch fort they [=th e Dutch) sent at least 30 shott to wellcome him. He was wounded in the foot, and some of the solders elsewhere, but his men had their revenge also, for they wounded a Dutch soulder in both the thighs and another in the foot as they were managing their guns. This caused a great animosity between them, & the Dutch begin to be affraid of their Towns people. 57 The Generali of the Danes, haveing mist the opportunity of comeing heither, 2 or 3 days after found an opportunity to make his escape and happily gott off to the Dutch fort, which I was glad to hear. The other 3 men I hope will be delivered me ere long. The messenger I sent so long agoe to Whydah is not yett returned, we here there are quarells between Offery and other countryes, which stops the passage both for man and beasts. 58 Inclosed goes my August accompt and ballance, being 3mk 7oz 12an of gold, which please to pass to my creditt. I was in hopes you would have ordered our pautkies white to have been sent to Whydah. They will never sell for 2an, it may be they may sell for one and a halfe, also they may lye and damage. If you can supply us with paper brawles [they] will doe very well. 1222.

The Dutch town people do dayly come over to us, & our new Town is now pritty full and will augme n dayly. We have no corispondency with the Dutch, they thinke we do to much in protecting the people which come to Jive with us.61 The leeward passages, the man I sent to Whydah is not returned yett. lnclo ed is a letter which I received from the Generali of the Danes,62 he complaines he has not necessaryes allowed him from the Dutch , and indeed they treat him more like an Negroe then a Generall. I have excused my selfe to furnish him wi.th anything so long as he is with a pack of rascalls , who abuse us as well as him and his nation , & who by their evill councell have been the cau e of his misfortunes, for he confessed they councelled him to quarell with the Negroes, which advise has ruined him , but I have wrot to him that I would send his letter to your perusall , that you might see what would be necessary for him . In 2 or 3 dayes he goes in a Briganteen from here to the Mine .63 1223. John Bloome James Fort , Accra , 14 Oct. 1693 Yours of the 6th instant I received.

John Bloome James Fort , Accra, 14 Oct. 1693 Yours of the 6th instant I received . It was an omission in my September accompt, for the 100 Turky carpetts are yett remaining . Of late the Dutch have gott a new Copeman, who is to do mighty matters. The Generali of the Mine has sent sundry blacks to accompany him , who are altogether by a multitud e of faire promises of large immunityes & restitut[i]on for the damages which they sustained by fire to perswade our new Cabbosheers to retume to the place where they received so great injury, but I hope they Jabour in vain, and do not doubt to maintain them here , altho the Dutch have offered to advance them 100 bencLies over and above their losse by fire. They have now got their new tower built, upon which they designe to place 12 gunns, & [I) hope wee shall receive the gunn catTiages per first, and [as] to the goods I wrote for, I desire you to add 40 or 60 fine sletias.

John Bloome James Fort, Accra, 5 Nov. 1693 Yours of the 21st ultimo I received in due time. Herewith goes my October accompt & ballance, being mk5 7oz -a of gold. Our new Cabbosheers have taken fetych to abide with us, which I am glad off, for if they should returne it would make worse for this Factory then if they had never [ms. 'new'] come. 1 have often solicited the blacks to release the 3 Danes which remaine with them, but I find they wo'not do it upon any termes, for they keep them to write letters aboard interlopers with whom they have a great trade. I cannot sell perpetuanoes for more than 10a, the country is soe much supplyed by the blacks from the Danes Fort at easy rates that they outdoe us, besides the Dutch sell them for lOa. If the brigantine bee not parted, 64 I desire you would bee pleased to send us a good quantity of sheets, for wee expect a trade as soon as Addo has done his new custome, the King and hee haveing reconciled their annimosities. 1225. John Bloom e Jame s Fort, Accra, 15 Nov. 1693 By a Black lately come from Whydah I am informed that Mr Smith, Mr Pearson and another whiteman are dead, which I thought fitt to advise, and also that Doctor Dougla ss is deceased. 65 The said man tells mee that the shipps sailed from thence aboute 3 weeks agoe. 66 In March 169 1/2 there went from hence in the Allegator Sloop nine paire of long irons, which I desire may bee returned per first opportunity [PS] The man I sent from hence stays for a letter. 1226. John Bloome James Fort, Accra, 9 Dec . 1693 Yours of the 19th ultimo I received per Capt. Bradshaw, with one hundred eighty umbanee , seventy five gallons mrnm, and the gunn carriadges on accompt of th Royall African Company of England. No[n]e of the carriages was big enough for two of our greatest gunns. Our gunner being indi posed, has desired leave to goe to Cabo Corso to consult about his distemper, hee knowes the dementions of the great gunns. Herewith I have sent my November accompt and ballance , being five marks, four angles, nyne taccoes of gold, which please to passe to my credit. By first opportunity I desire you will plea e to send us some halfe pieces blue Jong cloths , pautkies blue , and plaines green. I can't ell iron barrs for more then 2a. Wee have now about a hundred slaves, I wi 'h you would send for some , for our prisons are too full. [PS] Mr Bradshaw will sail on Munday . 1227.

The King of Quamboe is gone 7 or 8 leagues up the country towards Angui.nas, what his designe is I do not know. 67 They say the Akims are prepairing for warr , some ay against Quamboe ,68 and others against the Arcanye s.69 If they warr against any country , will put a stop to all trade. I desire you to end us the 9 paire of long irons, for our slaves are very much incommoded for want of them. 1228. John Bloome James Fort, Accra , 11 Jan. 1693/4 When Capt. Bradshaw come , I desire you will bee pleased to send us some wood for the burneing of shells, and also to order the surveyor to come for a day or two, to contrive a convenient spurr to the Fort, which I conceive will strengthen and bee a great ornament to the place. 1229. John Bloome James Fort, Accra, 16 Jan. 1693/4 Yours of the twelfth instant with 6 paire of short irons are come to hand. I perceive you are informed that the Quamboers had a designe to surprize us as they did the Danes, for what reason I know not, but must think them very malicious and unreasonable to attempt it, without any provoca tion. I desire you will be pleased to let mee know who it was that reported it, that I may bee the better able to judge of the probability of such a designe. By myne of the 11th instant, I desired you to send us some wood to burne shells, and also to order the surveyor to come for a day or two to contrive a conve nient spurr, which will strengthen the Fort very much. The gunn carriages I shall expect, which will serve us in great steade, in case the French should come upon the Coast. PS. There are three Portuguezes whose shipp was gone before their arrival!, they haveing a desire to goe to Cabo Corso, have promised to pay the canoe men on arrival I. 1230.

Wee have but a few men, and I desire you lo lett us have a speedy supply, for if they doe us any injury it will bee for want of hands 10 defend us. John Yoargin I shall send up by the next canoe. 70 The Dutch are well supplyed with men and are resolved to have constantly upwards of thirty soulctiers. As for gold wee shall have little or none these two months. There is nothing goes forward now in Quamboe but preparations for warrs. The King has sent a great party already downe to fight to leeward, and most of Accra will follow ere long. As for slaves wee have sixty men and fifty two women. Wee have had diverse deade these two months of the gripes &ca. As soon as possible, I shall send you my January and February accompts.

When the ways are open, I belieive he may be veryinstrumental to induce a trade , soe leaveing it to your judgement. 1233. John Bloome James Fort, Accra, 6 March 1693/4 Sundry of our slaves being lately dead and others falling ick dayly makes meapt to think that they are too much crowded in their lodging , and besides havenot the benefitt of the air, therefore have thought fit to send by the five handedcanoe 12 men, and desire you will be pleased to send by returne of the sameplains & perpetuanoes green, tap ells and allejar or what you may have of thesesorts to make up a leading. 1234. John .Bloome James Fort , Accra, 8 March 1693/4 I wrot you the 6th instant that I had sent 12 men slaves by the 5 hand canoe, but itseems they returned 4 of them , the canoe being too much loden. Our slaves havegotta di ease amongst them which first seizes them in the belly & thence in thestomack, and altho lusty trong slaves kills them immediately. What it is I don'tknow, but the Blacks say it is a catching disea e, therefore I have sent by the 3hand canoe 6 men, and would send all those who are not attackt if I had canoesto do it. If you please to end some goods by retume of the canoe, that she maynot come empty. 1235. John Bloome James Fort , Accra, 18 March 1693/4 Mylast was the 15th instant per the 5 hand canoe, 74 whereby I sent 8 men slave ,and now by this 3 hand canoe I have sent 6 men slaves, and desire you to send byreturne of the same as many sheets as she can take . James Fort, Accra, 4 April 16941236.

According your order I shall purchase 400 chests of come more, which I doubt not will be ready against the Shipps come downe. I shall neglect no oppertunity, for I know it requires expedition. The slaves we buy here are not all Quamboers, but I know they are natives not far from thence, although they speak another lingua,76 however they doe not cost the Company £4 sterling per head which the Captains are allowed for Whydah Negroes.77 As soon as the Briganteen has gott the shell on board, which now lay ready, she shall depart, but she cannot take the slaves, being voyd of con.venience for that purpose. [PS] We are building of a spur, for which I desire you to send us a gale steed [= gate stead?]78 and door per first.

Since the 15th we have had noe trade at all. The Quamboers are threatened by the Akims with fire & sword, and the Black Governor at the Danes Fort has bought a considerable quantity of gunns & powder for the King, out of two Dutch interlopers. Except they buy an accord we shall be utterly destitute of trade , and yett it is to be wished that the Akims may beat them & force a trade through their country, which they greatly desire. Inclosed is a letter of what is wanting in our store, which I desire you will please to upply, and more especially with bandeliers & cartouch boxes, that our men may look like soldiers as our neighbour doe.

The 12th in tant Capt. Shirley deceased, and the 13th was interred in this place. 8 ¡For more than 15 dayes past we have had much violent raioe that since the memory of man the like has not been knowne. They have brought downe our [blank] flaocker,81 and most of the other worke looks very suspitious, they are bwl t of nothing but stone & red earth, which cements no more then the sand on the sea shore, but I rebuild, I am resolved shall be more substantial!, with good mortar. We have but one bricklayer, I desire if you can spare us some, and the surveyors advice would be very necessary. I would have sent up Mr Gilois82 if the season had permitted but now I have not a canoe, for the East India Merchant having lost her canoe I was forced to spare mine, and shall see to gett another for the factory . I take notice of what you write about the Danes, as yett they have done nothing with the Blacks. 83 Ere Jong I shall write more about that matter, and of the debts due from Yorgen. Have lost 2 of our new men, and diverse others are sick. The raines still continue. 1241. John Bloome James Fort , Accra, 3 1 May 1694 By the 5 hand canoe goes Mr Gilois. Bad weather has detaind him sundry daycs. Our South East flanker is sunk very much, and the wall on the inside is broke downe, all wh.ich must be repared first, for our great gunns are upon it.

Atl present I am very indisposed and have gott a weakness in my hands in soe much that I am not able to help myself. We are like to have no trade.

Wee shall take what possible care wee can to secure ourselves here, being not in any ill circumstances with the Negroes. 1244. John Bloome James Fort, Accra, 21 June 1694 My last was of yesterdays date, wherein I advised of a Dutch interloper that lay in this road, by whom I designed to write to the Royall Company, but he went off in the night, soe that I have not made use of that opportunity. I desire you'ld end me the iron worke by the returne of the canoe. 1245. John Bloome James Fort, Accra, 5 July 1694 Yours of the 25th ultimo with the ironworke we received.

Of the I.a. t twenty plaines that was sent fourteen were damaged. Pray what you send Jett them be good, for we have a great many damaged. If you want a ladeing of shell for the Briganteen, they ly reddy, but have noe canoe to carry them off. Inclosed is a Jetter from the Dane touching John Yoargen's debt, to which referr you. 87 The man that wrote the letter abuses the English nation in generall very much, and that because the King of Quamboe told him that the English would give a great kettle full of gold for their Fort. 1246. John Bloom e James Fort, Accra, 17 July 1694 Yours of the 10th & 13th July T have received, & the note you inc losed upon the late Generall of the Dane , I shall demand & lett you have their answer. By the 11hand canoe we have received twenty five chest of sheets & four barrells of gunpowder, which I shall keep for Fort use, for the Blacks have supply enough from Dutch interlopers. I am informed the Quamboers want another plunder; we shall take what care we can to secure our selves. The Blacks overawe the Danes severely and alreddy don't fear to say that they'! be revenged of them when the ships are gone for some penurious actions they have done the Cabbosheers which went with them to Quamboe about the recovery of their Fort. John Britlover [=Brithower] , one of our men, layes stone very well and can doe as much worke as two Blacks. For some consideration per month be is willing to worke, and indeed furthers the work extraordinarily, I am glad we have such a man. 1247. John Bloome James Fort, Accra, 2 Aug. 1694 This accompanys my July accompts & ballance , mk2 15a 7ta of gold. The Akims have been at Quamboe these 15 dayes with good store of gold, but the King won't suffer them to buy anything, untill they have taken a fetish to be true to Quamboe, but they being only traders it seems can't doe it, that being a matter of great concernement, and the prerogative power being in their King & Cabbosheers. I am afraid it will never be well soe long as the old man reigns att Quamboe , for he has continually new projects in his head, he has stopt the way soe that wee have neither come nor other provisions. We have secured our north west Oancker and have begun our north east, which will be very substantiall, eight foot thick & five thereof with limes, but wee shall be a long time to finish all, haveing a vast work in hand. The Dutch make their flanckcrs all with solid stone. Our south west flanker, under which is our prison for men, I thinck won't stand long, however it must be new laid with coconutt. When you have an opport unity I desire you to send us some brick, & forelocks &ca to keep our guns firm in their carriages, for when we fire 'em they leap out and break our flankers. 1248. John Bloome James Fort, Accra, 28 Aug. 1694 By yours of the 21th [var. ' l 1th'] instant I perceive the arrival of Capt. Piles & Capt. Buttram to windward. 88 Whal slaves present l shall endeavou r to procure, but they are not very plenty. lnclosed you will receive the accompts of whats due from the Danes, who will pay nothing but ill words. Ere long wee shall want bricks, alsoe forelocks formerly wrott for, and nailes, and we are extreemly in want of a long ladder to mend our tower, which is very faulty in [s)undry places. The Quambores & Akins are not yett agreed, but they say there are hopes of an accomodation ere long. The Blacks are very tedious in their resolutions, I wish it may prove well io the eod. 1249. John Bloome James Port, Accra, 4 Sept. 1694 My last was the 2th ultimo. Herewith I have sent my August accompts and baJlance, being mks2 1oz ISa 3ta, which please to place to my creditt. The King of Quamboe & the Akins can't agree, and therefore the Akins are gone home. If you have any umbanees, paper brawles, long cloth white & blue, allejeires, spiritts & sheets I desire you will please lo furnish us per first, for if any slaves to be had wee shall have occasion of such goods.

I desire you to send us some irons, all we have ar in use. Capt. Buttram had 9 long paire of irons the last voyage, which were upon the laves which went from hence in the sloop, if we can have them they will be very serviceable to the Factory. Edward Barter has ent some cows & bulls, 90 the canoe men have taken 11 bulls. H re are some cows larger , which they would not take. They ay Edward Barter will be here tomorrow . Our bricklayer wants tools according to the inclosed. 1252.

Wee heare that Capt. Pepperell hath near quite his complement of slaves , and that the Blackes have keept a great many slaves for Capt.

Corne here is no probability of getting any, hardly [even] for the use of thi á place. I have sent three messengers to the king of Quamboe, but have as yett gott noe come from thence, the way being stoped before I came hither, & a he sends me word i because of the Dutch sending corne in their Briganteene to the Mina. I have now a me senger there, & hope to have go[o]d news at his returne. I doubt shall be forced to exced 2a per chest, & at noe rate gett any more than what wiU be expended here, till the new come comes in, notwithstanding my endeavours shall not be wanting. Passed by this road a ship ofva t great burthen with English collour , & in her company a Briganteen with Dutch coJlours, which I beleive wa the Dutch briganteene that took come here & bound to the Mina. I hear since the great one was a French ship. PS. I desire the iron worck wrote for, with some ban hoock & small staples for wind[o]wes, here being not one that is good in all the fort. Here i a fresh leak break in our tanck, that it holds but 3 foot water, therfore desire the ta1ns may not be forgott, this canoe may bring it. 1281. Edward Searle Accra, 5 June 1695 Yours of the 3dinstant have received with what sent in her, only the sheets want three in every chest, & the last sent seven chests wanted each four, which is more then I have ever heard before. Some of them where ingeniously packed, so that it could not easily be perceived, others were perfectly taken of the top without any repacking. The canoe men all saw these opened this day. Three chest where verry fair, one bad three taken of the top ranck, so that for the future J de ire the che ts may be opened at Cabo Corso, & where it seems hollow, tho' never áo well a top, they may be examined, for I belive it is rogury aboard the ships, & doubtle s you have more of the same. The pewter you mention to be 1 lb are 3 lb basons. The white longcloths are all di[s]posed of, if any I desire two cases. The certificates for the sheets goes here inclosed. You should have had my accompts before this time but am not able to write them if I might gaine the world, being brought exceding low with feavor, flux & gripes, of which am afraid shall never recover. Trade is veny dull here at present, what we have is only from the Quamboers them selves. They say the Accims will certainly fight them & not make up the differance, which will stop trade here if soc. PS. I have retum'd four of the musketts you sent, the serjant telling me they are good for nothing, two the springs broake & two will make noe fire. Desier four per next. James Fort, Accra, 9 June 16951282. Edward Searle This is to desire on accompt of the Royall Company a good quantity knives, some brass diglins & small brass panns if any, also some white long cloths, to be sent as soon as possible. By this canoe have sent Samuell Moore, who has been lame a long time, & our doctor haveing spent all the medicines he can suply himself with, am forc' d to grant him leave to goe up, or he must perish here, soe desire per returne of the canoe another man in his rooroe. James Fort , Accra, 20 June 16951283. Edward Searle Your s of the 17by JJ hand canoe with the goods sent by her have received, & by returne of her have sent three of our Arda men slaves, & desire three in exchange of them. Mr Bloome gott four of them from the bleaks[= blacks), they are Beneen slaves,97 they came ashore here with a great canoe from some ship, so I putt them to work, & last weak one of them run away, and the Serjeant told me that the other Ardas told him that these intended to run after him, therfore to preventt that I have sent them you, for if they run to Quamboe it is hard getting them. As yet U1ere is noe news of him that is gone, but shall endeavour to gett him if possible. I desire those you send may not be Allampo 's .98 On opening the sayes formerly sent found one short, as per the incloscd certificate. If you can spare any powder pray send twenty barrells in halves, I have been often sent to by the Cabbosheers of Quamboe for some. James Fort, Accra, 7 July 16951284. Edward Searle This accompanys my accompts for May & June, with i[t)s baUance, being three marques, seven ounces, one angle & seven taccoes. Alsoe a certificate left me by Mr Browne, by which the ground rent of the pleace apears to be paid to the first of August next. The King of Quamboes man Affomadoe has been here, & demands five month ground rent, four being due at Mr Bloomes departure from hence . I could give him no other answer then what this cenificate derected, only telling him I would advise you of it, & if any thing was due to the I(jng it should be paid. He went away contented with that answer , but as soon as be arrived at Aquamboe, came me sengers sent by the King to stop all trade or provitions from us, saying that I was come to cheat him, and I should have no trade before he had hi money, but I agreed with the fellowes that they should not put their fetish up,99 hearing [ms. 'hareing'] how chargeable it had been in Mr Whitings time, till I had sent to Quamboe. The Kings answer was that I cheated him, and that he would make noe pallaver unless I came my selfe, soe was forced to returne the messenger again with a dashee of a broad sattin & a case of spirrits. They bring me word he is contented with till this canoe return, but I am certaioe he will be paid it againe, tho' without doubt Mr Bloome bas already paid him , but doe believe is cheated by his servant Affoemadoe, who I have already found a great rouge. Mr Browne can tell you the most of this of any body. Pray consider what you will doe in it. I have u eel aU the arguments I can , but he is fully directed by his messenger, & to be sure now Mr Bloome is absent they will never owoe the payment. I desire on accompt of the Royall Company a good quantity of sheet , one caske or more of knives, if you have them. The King of Quamboe sent me word I should take care w[h]at I did, for he could take our fort when he pleased, that I might see how he served the Deans. I wish wee had a spun before our gate, being verry open too the negroes. Here is a verry good gate, for it, & I have stone broake & belive the shells will make lime enough to build it, & presume at present for want of lime you have little to doe for your bricklayers , if you please to send two or three hither with what is here already may raise a spun in a veny short time, which will be great safeguard to us against the blacks, & as oone as done they may returne 1285. Edward Sear le James Fort , Accra , 24 July 1695 Yours of the 13dinstant have received. Captain Quo & Braboe has been at Quamboe, who both accompanys this. The K.ing if you require it is contented to loose the four bendyes he says due before Mr Bloome departure & that I pay him from the time Mr Bloome left this place. Qllo carried him as from you a ca e of spirrits, a sattin & a Jongee, & Adoe a ca e spirrit , and about 2 days since he sent to me for two iron barrs to row aw, which I sent, suppo eing it customary or he would not have ent to me for them. Mr Cooper cannot spare hi bricklayers. 100 Beseides blaks I have here, I want white[s], & they shall returne in a short time, that it may be done as it should be. Besides I want the tower to be surveyed, that we may contrive if possible to secure it before the latter rayns, for if it falls you have not men to build it at present, & here is no other place for the Companys effects or a Chcif to be in, & if secured it may stand for of [=a ught] I knows three or four years more, but J desire not your bricklayers to stay any Longer then raiseing the spurr and directing the bleaks here how to secure the tower, which I will se shall be done after they are gone. I desire Thomas Howard may be one of them you send. The walls al[l] round the fort are of a good thickness, only that which is next the towne, which is not above a foot & a half thick and build with swish, which I dcsigne if you thinck convenient after the spurr is built, to make two foott thicker of good stuff, it laying just open to the Dutch fort. I believe Polonia [= Polandl linnen may sell here, the Dutch sell a sort of sletias much like it, if you plaese to send a case, if they goe of shall send for more, and pray load the canoe with bricks to tume the arch over the spur [ms. 'spurg'] gate. Lime I have not any burnt. If you will have any shells gott here more than for use of the fort, now is the season, and when I have your order, will employ the free people to gett what quantity you will have. I can hcare nothin g of the blak taylor. 101 The mallato is willing to serve for soldiers pay, he is as I hear as good carpenter, & when any thing is be done here he will worke. He has served at the Dutch fort many years, & have now gott discharge from the Generali of the Mina. The Dutch Copeman give a good caracter of him, so I believe he may deserve the pay of a soldier , if you thinck conve nient. PS. We have not any saws in the fort. I desire by this canoe a hand saw. The certificate goes here inclosed . 1286. Edward Searle James Fort, Accra, JO Aug. 1695 Thi s accompanys my July accompts & ballance, being mk9 4oz 9a 8t good gold. I expect the l<ing of Aquamboe[s] man here a Tuesday, & then shall pay him from ultimo February, which I hope will end all disputes. Sayes Jbelieve if you ordered them to be sold at 14a, would vend here, the Dutch sell att 1oz 2a, and their says are val I ued above a peez better then ours. Here is the half of the two cases sent me lost for bad collours, which if they were cheaper may sell, otherwise will lay & damage, here [being] a great quantity already. I desi re with the sletias two cases says on accompt of the Royall African Company of England, also brass pans, twenty narrow satins, fifty charcolecs & fifty pintadoe s broad if you have any, as soon as possible, alsoe three slaves in the roomc of them sent you, which we cannot shift without, wanting them to look after our iron slaves, L02 & doe the work of the fort. Corne has been verry dear here, the English interloper give 4a per chest for all the come he could gett, but now i turned to windward, I hope to bring them to 2a per chest shortly. The Dutch are ordered to buy all the corne & slaves they can gett. I desire the nee s arys at the foot hereof. 1287. Edward Searle James Fort, Accra, 19 Aug. 1695 Yours of the 15th in tant per the 11 hand canoe with the goods sent by her I have received. The sletias are much of a sort, the best or worst will never yeild above 6a, and the chints no more then Sa at this place. I have paid the King of Aquamboe five bendys ground rent from ultimo February. 1288. Edward Searle James Fort Accra, 12 Sept. 1695 This accompanys my Augu t accompt. The canoe has been of thls four nights, by w[h]ich J had sent the ballance , but the weather proveing bad, that she could not goe, & the breese till continufog strong, have kept it till another opportunity . I desire on accompt of the Royall African Company of England sixty sayes, & that the cases may be opened & the [w]rappers ripped to see they are not damaged, & that they are of good collers, for here is many of these last sent that are much damaged and bad collers. The people all hereabout are goeing to wars to lea ward of the River Vulter, 103 and here is Ashamannee 104 and all our Cabbosheers are verry earnest with me to upply them with a little powder. If you can possible spare any I desire that I may have ten barrells, and I will keep as much of it for the use of the fort as I can. The Akims threaten the Quamboers again, which I fear wilJ put a stop to trade in these parts.tos Pray send the ironworck formerly desired, also some laves irons, long or short. PS. The Engli h interloper Capt. Sherrings 106 slaves rise & ha k:ill'd his doctor, boatswine & 2 men more , & of the slaves were killed about 100 before they could make them yeild, they takeing an opportunity when the boate was ashore awa.tering, was like to have had the ship to them selves, the same day he left this coast. 1289. Edward Searle James Fort , Accra, 24 Sept. 1695 Yoursof the 20th instant with the sayes sent by the 11hand canoe have received , also the ironworke . In takeing the baile[sJ out of the ca e today I perceived att one side of a baile to be rotted by salt water, also another [in] opening some to sell, not one free from the worme, both w[h]ich I have by the canoe returned, not havei ng any body here to judge of the damage, and so many damaged here already. The case I opened could not put them all in again, but have sent three in (w]rapper. I hope the others may prove good. The spurr is almost finished. The briklayers have been sick. We must do somethi ng to the tower or it cannot stand. I will sent your briklayers up by next opportu nity, & from Mr Cooper I had not any.107 The Arcims have panyard a great quantity of goods and traders and some are killed, which hath put a stop to trade here, and I doubt it will not be good any more till they have fought. 108 Capt. Lauren sa de Souza , a Portuguez, brough t a man hither which he sayd was indepted at St Thoma, that he dares not retume, who was desirous to serve the Royall Company at this place, and he[= de Souza) giveing me his word that he knows him to be an honest man, I have entertained him from pay day last. I have sent all the broakcn mauls, pickaxes , wedges &ca, an (ms. 'on') accompt of which is inclosed, and we are in great want of new in their rooms, not having any left, I desire they may be made out of hand , & 3 slaves in the roome of them sent you, these here not being able to do the work of the fort. PS. 9 mauls 24 wedges 5 pickaxes I axe I crow 1290. Edward Searle James Fort, Accra, 22 Oct. 1695 Yours of the 19 instant I have received with the powder &ca sent per the 5 hand canoe. I shall doe what I can to satisfie the King of Aquamboe , I expect a messenger this day from him purposely [with] your answe r, per next I shall advise you what áhe says. 109 PS. l desier the ironwork may be ready by the end of this month which formerly write for, with two axes, we had but one left, & that was broake about two day since. 1291. Edwa rd Searle James Fo rt, Accra, 23 Oct. 1695 Yours of the 3d instant by land from Alampo have rece ived. 110 The king of Quemboc never sent a messenger on purpose to me about Mr Coope rs boy going up to the Arcims country, but he spoke of it once to me, & I told him it might be that he had sent a boy thither, but if he had, the king might assure him self it was nothing of any palaver concerning him , but that the English was & would continue friends to him, that it must be to encourage traders to his factory, as it was the custome of all whitemen to doe, on which accompt to be sure it was & nothing else . This comes expres ly by the king of Quamboe desire to acquaint you that the Arcims are certainly comeing to fight him, and earnestly request you to assist him with fivety barrells pouder, that he doe require no assistance of any else but the English , who alwais stood their friends in all their words. I know he asked some of the Deane, but his an wer was if he had a thousand barrells he would not spare him one. Whither the Dutch supply him with any or not I cannot tell, but he mightily pretends he relyes on you. I have advised how scarce powder is on the Coast, he sayes he knows you are never so short but that you have to supply your friends, so what you send for [ms. 'four] him or what answer you send I will gi.ve, and keep as fair a correspondence as possible, not giving an opportunity in the l[e]ast to any to do u damage. The Acra ' s are mightily afraid the Quamboe will come on them before they fight the Arcims. Addoe has been daily expected here, but now I hope he will not come , for Peter Pa op111 was geeing up co fetch him, and some blacks informed the Dutch Copeman that it was with an intent to surprise their fort , which I believe has put a stop to his comeing. When the people heard of hi comeing they were all at me to seU them a bmTell powder, to watch their towne. I putt them off, telling them that when they know he would realy come they should not want powder nor any assistance if he offer'd to molest them, but it was really that I had not in the fort enough to spare any out, therefore I desire that whatever you send for the king of Quamboe that you will send me a good supply for the fort, with 100 lb small shott, for we have few or none , nor any conveniency here to make any, and being at [ms. 'ad'] such a distance if any thing happened cannot presently have supply. PS. I suppo e he de ignes to give either mony or pawns for his powder. Haveing no trade is the reason I send noe accompts, at the end of this month hall make up all together. 1292. Edward Searle James Fort, Accra, 28 Oct. 1695 Yours of the 25th instant I have received, & accordingly gave the Dutch Copeman an invitation hither, which he excused , saying that he was not able , being ill . 112 Whether he have had some notice from the Mine or not of the Generalls intent I know not, but I have not seen him above tltis two months, & since I have been here wee have had but verry little correspo ndance together . The Arl<ims & Aquamboes palavera is now verry hott, they say the Arldms are on their march to Quamboe. 1293. Edward Searle James Fort , Accra, 7 Nov. 1695 This accompanys my accompts for September & October with the ballance , being seven markes iliree angles & five taccoes, also the ballance of my August accompts, being ten markes four onces fourteen angles and five taccoes good gold, together is seventeen marks four ounces and fourteen angles & seven taccoes. I desiere to know what Doctor Hayes sallary is, & what you allow him for expence of medicines, & from what time his sallary is due, also what his allowance for his diet is, he desireing to be paid. Also I desire white long cloths to make a flagg for the fort, this here being all to pieces, & the iron worck if done. PS. Inclosed is a petition of John Brethore. I desire axle trees for the gunns per the canoe, what s[h]e can take in. 1294. Edward Searle James Fort, Accra, 7 Dec. 1695 This accompanys my November accompts. I have at present noe trade, want of goods is part ly the reason. I know not what to make [of] the Quamboe & Aldm palavera.113 The Quamboes comes now verry Little to the waterside downe & is very troublesome to the Accras, in soe much that they are almost ready to leave He 114the place. putt them to abundance of charge more than was usuall in Ahenesas time, every months or two stops the come from comeing downe & then must have his demands before they can gett any. The Accras that are to leaward of the River Volta 115 has killed a Cabbosheer called Aucutto, who for some years past has hindred the way by land to Arda, 1 16 soe now hope to have the lea ward way open in a little time. Here is a great stiere [=sti r] about him, Addo haveing taken a feteech to him that he should not be molested, therefore threttens to kill all that Live here, though is his owne people that assist the Accras & without there help [they] could not have conquered him. 117 I judge the reason of the slaves dying soe fast is chieftly the faughlt of the cankey stones grinding away amongst the come. I never heard till now that the free people here buy their stones from other places, these being only in a manner sand, therefore desire eight large stones from your part . If the canoe cannot bring them pray end another with her, & l doubt not but we hall have an alteration, for here is lusty good slaves taken with the gripe [ms. 'guye'] one day & dead the next, others fall dead at once , & noe other reason can I thinck of them than that. Our flagg stafe is broake, if you have ever a peice of old ma t or large sparr about tenn foot Jong to putt to the battune [=batten?] 118 that may still serve, which I desier may likewise be sent, with hoopes & large nails fitt for the worke, also a little canvess for the head of the flagg. If you have any iron I desier your great canoe with her loading. John Burton has left £8 a yeare in England & has not had a Jetter thence this seaven yeares , therefore humbly beggs [ms. 'baggs') that you will be pleased to grant him his whole pay here, soe that none may be paid there, which will doe him a great kindnes , his pay here being verry small. I cannot have stone ready presently to case a wall of the fort, soe have sent up your other bricklayer, I have paid him to the la t pay day. 1295. Edward Searle James Fort , Accra , 15 Dec. 1695 Your of the 12 instant, with two hundred & fifty iron barrs, have received, and per returne of the canoe have sent two bunches of corrall containing one hundred & six ounce & a half, it being o verry pale it will never sell here, the Dutch haveing a large upply [of] good come downe by their slave ship soome days since. There is likewise a great quantity of sad collour pautkies which will never yeild a taccoe in these parts, and I beleive may sell in Fanteene, here being no blew and here is blue both at Dutch and Deanes. They are most of the goods, so by next opportunity hall [ end] them up. The 10th instant came ashoare here a Portuguez knowne by one which hath served the Company here severall years , and he d ireing to be entertained in the Royall Company service [I] have entertained him as a soldier for 3 year . PS. The inclo ed is John Burtons petition. 1296. Edward Searle James Fort, Accra, 6 Jan. 1695/6 This accompanys my December accompts , as al o the black taylor that run from the Hill, you must secure him , for if he gett into these part any more he wilJ be kept cleare of me. I panyard all the Esbue Cabbosheers 119 about hiro and thretned to send some of them to you before they would confess they knew he was in there towne , and after they brought him I gave them more than the usuall custome to content them, that they might not take it ill being panjard , as you will see by my accompts, but here is no other way to deale with the people in these parts that live out off our commands. I shall raise the narrow baf[t]s if I can, but 2a 6ta has been the usuall rate here, soe beleive it will be hard. 1297. Edward Searle James Fort, Accra, 6 Feb. 1695/6 120 Yours of the 4 instant came to hand last night about nine a clock, just as the canoes came from the Mine were gone out of the bay. 121 About three days agoe came down three, all loaden with shells and says. I detained not your canoe a minuite, but sent her away to Mr Cooper, she having three padlers, with a small note, which doubt not but was with him long before the great canoes could pass Winnebah, soe hope he has seized them. 122 Whether they was our canoes or not I cannot tell, but one hath a broken head much like to your old canoe. 123 I will purchase what slaves offers, men are verry scarce here, but if you can buy men, I can in a short time gett what quantity of women you please, but to buy a man & a woman 124 I shall not get many, so pray lett mee have your orders . I am heartily glad of the anivall of the Fauconberg, & hope that the report of the negroes that there is come in company with her three shipps more may be true. This is to desire on accom.pt of the Royall Affrican Company of England the following goods of wha t sort you have, vizt five hundred perpetuanoes blue, two hundred ditto green, sheets at least one hundred chests, six cases of knives, fivety narrow sattins, fivety silke longees, fifty cases spirritts, one pound, two pound & three pound pewter basons a good quantity, one pound as many as you can, brass panns, paper brawles, Guinea stuffs, halfe blew long cloths, white long cloths, Dutch ambanees, blew plaines, blew pautkes, small painted carpetts, & corrall, of each a good quantity. The King of Quamba has lately had several ! dashees from the Dutch. Now if you please to send a scarlett cloth, a case of spirits and halfe a barrell of powder for each of them, 125 I believe it will be very acceptable, and cause them to encourage trade, for the Dutch supplyed them with powder when they would have had it of you, and gave them liquor, & halfe a barrell each. If you cannot presently supply me with the goods above mentioned, I desire I may have a canoe full for the purchas ing of slaves, not haveing vendible goods here, but shall bee heartily glad if you have a small vesse ll to send down, for .it is not above 3 days since the Dutch [received] one hundred chests of sheets, and if I had any, it would much sp[o]yl their trade. 1298. Edward Searle James Fort, Accra, 22 Feb. l695/6 This serves only to advise you that what few slaves offers I cannot purchase, nothaveing goods in the fort 126 that is wanted here. I desire if you send any vcssellswith goods that you would order me to send you these slaves, our prison nowbeing very full, & hope when I have more goods shall get more slaves then lthought for. Also l desire a good quantity of slaves irons. If 1 had white longcloths or blew ditto, would be a great meanes. This day I have discharged JohnBrithere, & sent hjm on board the Dutch interloper , & inclosed is the petition ofWilliam Coller, who being sick desires to goe home, soe desire you would bepleased to send two men more in their roome, if you discharge them, and more ifyou can spare them, the fort being the weakest man' ctof the three.

On Sunday themessenger returned with a boy of the said Attaboies with three pons of palmewine, with two sheep, and brought the following answer, as I am informed [by)Captain Yaboy, 127 who I dare believe , that if he will send six perpetuanoes , two says & two barrells of powder, that the Anguinnas will march to the waterside &force you lo deliver them the said people. This l have from severall hands thatAttaboes boy is certainly now in the Dutch town , but theres from none but Yabothe answer he brings. 128 The message the Dutchman sent is confirmed by all, andnoe doubt of the truth of itt, see I thlnk itt convenient that you give theDutchmen immediate advise thereof, that no difference happen betwee ne youand the negroes till you are heller provided, for to be sure they will think ofsome way to fetch the Mine people to Cabo Corso, and then the Negroes will nottrunkof troubleing you. Last night l heard of [a) dasshee from the Anguinas, anddid mistrust somthing to this effect, or [that] the Dutch were incling[=inclining] to settle att Winibah, so went to Yabo [~argin: seven a clock at night] & desired him to inform himself of the truth thereof, what [=which] is above, not having furthe[r] to enlarge. 1300.

The difference between the Kings of Quamboe will I believe in few dayes be made up, but believe the Dutch ettleing at Poney will againe renew it, for Bonishee says he will turne them out ,140 which I shall be very glad off, for it will be a great hinderance to this place if they remaine there. Now there is a new talk of the Ailcims comeiog on the Quamboes , and till they once fight, or clearly make up all palaver , here will be but small trade. I omited to advise you that James Mason made a will, and left his estate in the hands of William Ses on . Of the sayes I have disposed of since my being here, I have had at least five hundred turned by reason of the wormholes. I have had it done by two Blacks , for which I promised them payment , and I thinck if you please to alow them they deserve a damaged saye each. I put on board the SaUy Rose the 24th October 12 men and 13 women slaves on accompt of the Royall Company . She did not anchor, or I hould have wrote you by Capt. Piles. PS. Wee are in want of. hour, hourr and two hours glasses to keep the hours of the day. 1317. Edward Searle James Fort, Accra, 24 Nov. 1697 Yours of the 10th instant with two banells gunpowder and an hour glass have received. I have used all the .indeavours possible to purchase slaves. Shipps follows so fast one affter another that the Alampores brings not one up, I have not had a slave from thence this six months. Adoe of Quamboe with all his towne is gone to fight Accrippoone, 141 which likewise hinders. I have thirty odd, presume you will send your great canoe for them, by which time hope may have fifty. What perpetuanoes I barter am forced to let goe at 10a blue, and 9a green, and if I must not sell them so for gold, shall not take money to defray factory charges. I have sett the negroes to gett oyster shells. I desire by the great canoe a good flagstaff, block and halliards. The 19th instant at night happened here a very great turnado, with which was violent thundering and lightening. It broke our flaggstaff all in pieces, and indangered the whole fort by a clapp that broke in at the topp of the tower downe into the little gold roome, where was but a foot wall between it and the powder. It carryed such violent fire with it that it melted me two pewter dishes alone as if they had been put over a flame of fire, and God be praised done me no further damage. 142 I desire likewise bunting for a fl.agg, this being all in peices. 1318. Edward Searle Accra, 7 Dec. 1697 Yours of the 3d instant by Mr Lancelott Anderson have received , with one hundred gallons rumme on accompt of the Royall Company. The canoe brought no flagstaff. Wee are in want of as much plank as will make six gunn carryages, large, and a cask of tarr if you have any. Desire it may be sent with the tlagg staff. The goods you advised were the Braffoes 143 had been delivered long since, but the wayes are so stoped that as much as a boy cannot pass Bonishee s Towne that belongs to Adoes, which is the reason that nobody has been to desire them, they belonging to Adoes Towns people. 144 The first messenger that demands them, I assure you shall have them. I only take them to keep the Blacks in subjection, that they should not make a common practice landing goods just under our walls. I took them one morning, being upon the flanker, [they] came just before me, therefore could not well lett them pass. By the 15 and 13 hand canoe have sent on accompt of the Royall A:ffrican Company of England 13 men and 14 women slaves, which was putt ashore by Capt. Piles. One of the men dyed the next day affter the sloop sailed hence. Also have sent fifty slaves that I have purchased (vizt) twenty four, men 24 women, one boy and one girle, which is aJl I could possibly gen, for which as I wrote you in my la t have bartered perpetuanoes at 10a and 9 angles, which if you doe not alow of must stand to the loss my selfe. I will dispose of none for gold, tilI.you order it. 1319. Edward Searle James Fort, Accra, 10 Dec. 1697 Having this opportunity by a canoe bound for your parts, desire you will please to send me on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England some iron barrs, perpetuanoes blue, and powder, for forts use, with which please to send the flagg staff I desired in mine the 7th in tant. 1320. Edward Searle Accra, 16 Dec. 1697 This accompanyes two men, two women laves, which is all that have offered since my l.ast. This comes express, the Deanes expecting suddenly to deliver their fort over to a new Company, and their men all being to have their liberty to goe home, or serve who they please. 145 The Chiefe tells me that all ex.cept three or four, which resolves home, will serve the Royall Company, if you please to entertaine them, amongst which are two bricklayers, one of them as good a workman I beJeive as any in Guinea, by what I have een my selfe. The Dutch Coapman has offered him 12a per month. Likewise there is to di pose of thirty six timber peices of nineteen feet long, nine inches broad , and seaven inche thick, with two girders longer and thicker, pre umeing tho e things may be wanted to forward your buildings may be sent, that before I sett forward for CaboCorso, I may gett them hither, least the shipps come in my absence, 146 and then the Chiefe may not have liberty to di pose of them. There is likewise six gunnsnow aboard the shipp, four six pounder , two four pounder in the shipps hole, to be sould. The Chiefe sayes if you have occation for them, he will order them to be sold you at the shipps retume, shee being to make a windward voyage.147 PS. The timber is 4a each peice. 1321. Edward Searle James Fort, Accra, 18 Dec. 1697 Yours of the 15th instant with the particular s therein mentioned have received. I wrote you of the 16th instant, by a two hand canoe, by which sent two men, two women slaves; which is all that have offered. PS. Since lhe writeing of the above bought two men, two women slaves which goes herewith. James Fort, Accra, 21 Dec. 16971322. Edward Searle Yours of the 19th instant have received. Accordingly have bought from the Deane forty two pieces timber at 4a each. The gunns you may depend on. The shipp sayled from our parts this morning. The men cannot leave the fort till the arrivall of shipping, and then doe presume there is twelve will serve the Royall Company. Them and their things I can send up, when they come. The Chiefe docs not know but he may deliver the slaves to the other Company, if not shall have them. I have loaded the sloop with she1ls, and this night she will saile hence. PS. James Steward souldier deceased the 16th instant There is not any thing more to be disposed of that will be serviceable to you, only three peices of plank for gunn carriages, about 50 foot long, for which they demand 2oz 8a. Doe not know the worth of it, therefore shall waight your orders. ILis much wanted in this fort. James Fort, Accra, 24 Jan. 1697/81323. Edward Searle Yours of the 21st instant by the Cabo Corso Gally have received, also the goods mentioned therein, and have returned her loading with shells. The plank I will gett as cheap as I can. The 9'h instant deceased John Newell serjeant, he made a verball will before severall of our people, and left what he has here in Guinea to Mr Richard Sheldon. 148 The 8th instant deseased Roger Beaumont Gunner, he made no will. Next pay day you shall have his estate, with James Howard. I know you are in great want of men, but loosing these two know not what shaJI doe without others in their roomes. At present have given the charge of this guard to John Burton, who shall make Serjeant if you please, and if he does not mind his business [I] may change him, when you have a fresh supply of men, but a Gunner I desire you will send downe as soone as this comes to hands. 1324. Edward Searle James Fort, Accra, 9 Feb. 1697/8 This accompanyes my accompts from ultimo October to ultimo January. Here is no manner of trade either for gold or slaves. I have bought the plank of the Deane for 1oz 8a. 1325. Josiah Pearson 149 James Fort, Accra, 26 Feb. 1697/8 According to your orders I have with Mr Gervis Jackson inventored the Royall Companyes Fott and factory at Winneba and Accra, which ioventoryes accom.panyes this, since which I have received your letter by the Merchants Goodwill, Capt. Charles Cotterrell Commander, with bill of ladeing inclosed for sundry goods, amounting to £545 J6s 3d sterling as by invoice, consined to my selfe for the accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England, and for what you ordered me in your Jetter shall observe with carefulness , hopeing to act those things, when come there to Whidah, as may conduce (as much as in me lyes) to the Royall Companyes intrest, most humbly desireing that you would be pleased to try the experiment of sending one small shipp downe there for slaves, wholy consigneing her to me, 150 gi veing me timely notice, and likewise to write to the Company, and acquaint them of the necessity of oblidging the Commander s to comply with the charter partyes. 151 I believe there is an error cornmited in the bra , for I u ppose one cask cannot containe 25cwt 2qrs 25 lb of brass, which hope your worshipps will take notice off. 1326. Edward Searle Accra, 8 March 1697 /8 According to your orders have with Mr Josiah Pearson and Mr Gervis Jackson inventored the Royall Companyes fort and factory now in my charge. Two inventoryes goes with Mr Jarvis Jackson, whose illness occasions his stay here. Also with this two hand canoe goes my February accompts . The 5(h instant deceased Mr Lancelott Anderson. I have made an outcry 152 of his things, when have received his money shall send it you. lnclosed is an instrument attested by those men which are wittness to John NewelJs will. Also a note of what stores our Gunner wants, desire this canoe may bring what shee can. 1327. Edward Searle James Fort, Accra, 27 March 1698 Yours of the 24th instant came to hand last night. The Deane is ready to saile, but stayes (as they are obliged) to see the fort in the new Company possession the first of Aprill, when God willing they intend to saile, 153 by which time pre.sume may have yow-letter, if nott shall desire their stay a day longer. Pray be as speedy as you can, for they are impatient to be gone, finding here not the least trade. I have prevailed with them for their cooper, tho' their new Chiefe told them he would protest against them, he belonging to the fort fonnerly, wherefore they are forced to give him another man in his roome. He will be wanted aboard till they saile, and then LI) shall have him, and shall by first send him to you. The Gunners stores wrote for in my last, wee are in great want off. James Fort, Accra, 5 April 16981328. Edward Searle Both yours of the ultimo March and 2dAprill have received, and have delivered your packque tt according to your orders, and the sloope has her loading of shells, which will saile hence this night, with the land wind. I am sorry must advise you that J was disappoin ted of the cooper. I had him here ashore, and the Generall, Captain of the shipp and my selfe used all the perswations possible with him to stay, but would not, but desired to goe to their owne fort, where he was before, so that since he has made them to be worse then their promise to you, they have given another man to their Chiefe in his roome , and has carryed him off the Coast, contrary to his expectation. They desire that you will not take it amiss of them, for they thought the man would be as ready to serve the Company, as they was to lett him. Accra, 11 May 1698 1329. Edward Searle Yours of the 16th instant have received, and accordingly have putt on board the Whidah Frigott, Capt. John Osborne commander, one chest fire lock musquets, and cons ined them to Mr Josiah Peirson. The sloope, Mr John Wilson Comma nder, sai led hence this morning, with his loading of shell. He was five dayes getting downe, by reason he had wind and currant contrary, and lay here four dayes before the canoes could work, the seas running high, whic h is the reason of his long stay. I have nott messured what he carryes, but have bought six hundred butts, and will buy noe more till these are gone. The vessell you mentioned pased by this place shewing no collours, butt anchored at Tesha 154 under English coulers, where he panyar'd twelve people, one of which he released for two ounces gold, the rest he carryed away. The 81b instan t deceased Mr James Hayes Chyrurgeon. He made a will, a coppy goes herewith inclosed. I desire that as soonc as this comes to your hands, that you will send me one to supply his place, such as you have till better comes, my men being very sickly and I beleive this att this time to be the sicklyest place on the Coast, and if should be taken ill my selfe it would be very hard, having none butt souldiers in the fort, and in case of death, know not what may become of the Companyes concerns and my owne. Should be very glad in case shipping do not arive if you could take three or four men from factoryes that are well manned, and send me here, being hardly well men to keep open the Castle gates. Here is no trade. At the end of this month shall make up my accompts . 1330. Edward Searle James Fort, Accra, 28 May 1698 This serves to acquaint you thatt I am in great want of a carefoll sober Se1jeant, and desire that you will be pleased to end me one express . John Burton yesterday morning att some dispute he had on the guard with the men, threw away his sword and cane and wore he would be Serjeant no longer, which 1 chanced to see, and having found him before, affter a short tryall, to be very unfiting for the place, I discharged him off itt, and putt him to his old station. I shall nott goe without the fort gate before you send me one to supply his place. lnclosed is a note againe of whatt tore our Gunner wants, which desire may be sent, or whatt part of itt you have to spare, being much wanted.

Edward Searle James Fort, Accra, 9 July 1698 I have put on board the sloope forty two timber peices which I bought of the Deane, and the remain[d]er of her loading with shells. I will gett what slaves I can. If the Companys shipps doe come before wee have any shipping here to buy up slaves, and you give me a supply of goods imediately, I question not to gett a good part of one shipps complement in a month or 5 weeks time. I have received the wedges and one mawle, and desire the remainder of what wrote for, by first opportunity, as I may repair the fort before the latter rains, or a great part of it will fall. Desire the other mawles may be large . [PS] The sloops canoe in bad weather broke from her sterne, and was taken up by a Dutch interloper, who has left her at Allampoe. 1 have sent for her. If she doe not come whilst the sloope is in sight , shall keep her till she returnes. 1333. Edward Searle James Fort, Accra, 22 July 1698 Yours of the 17th instant have received, and am heartily gladd to beare of the arrivaU of shipping, and hope the P1ince of Orange is not alone. Nott knowing what goods you may have to supply me with, have at foot hereof sett a list of what goods are vendable here, of which please to send such a quantity as your supplyes will afford, with one hundred pieces Polonia linnen or sletias for forts use, tenn barrells gunpowder, 20 striped sattins, 200 English woollen carppets, 100 white blankets. The trade is open here, butt the road is never cleare of Dutch interlopers, who sell their perpetuanoes at 4a 6t each, which makes me not write for any, haveing already a quantity here, what cannot put off for gold or slaves, without other goods. Pray supply me with sheets and cases spirits as many as can possible spare. 13thPS. I hope the -sloope is near your parts ere this. She sayled hence the instant, in the morning, by which wrote you. East India tapseils; ditto nicconeese; paper brawles; white long cloaths; ditto blue; 1 lb, 2 lb, 3 lb, 4 lb pewter basons; screwed juggs; brass digglins; sheetS; blue plaioes; cases spirits; seyes; broad chints; corral! if good red; Guinea stuffs . 1334. Edward Searle James Fort, Accra, 25 July 1698 I wrote you of the 22d instant an accompt of what goods are wanting here. This comes express to advise that about Fryday last fell in with Ningoe at Alampoe 156 an English Companys ship, as they reported to the Negroes, and that they was driven from the Graine Coast thither, and that they came in company with another great ship, presume the Prince of Orange. I sent as soone as I had the advise a canoe and a white man, but she was gone off to sea, to goe lo CaboCorso as they said, and have not heard any news of her since. You may know bywhat shipping you expect, whither it be true or not, but she was certainly anEnglish shipp. I beleive the sloopc will be a long lime getting up there, she isstill at Winneba. I wish I could have a supply of goods some olher way, slavesbeing plenty here, and I have not goods to buy them. 1335. Edward Searle James Fon, Accra, 3 Aug. 1698Yours of the 27th , 29th and 30th July have received, as also 21 chests sheets onaccompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England. The shipp which was anAllampoe, if a Companyes shipp, wilJ fall in to windward of your parts, for shemust certainly make a voyage round, 157 the currant makeing soc strong toleward. There was a white man belonging to the Dutch factory there 158 on board,and he gave the same accompt as the natives, and that the Captain purchasedabout tenn slaves, and that he asked particular ly for me by my name, which is allthe accompt 1can give. I hope ere this the sloope is arived in your parts, goodsbeing in great want. Hope you have a supply off, for wee are in great want. Infew dayes shall send my accompts. PS. The Royall Companys packett came too late, Capt. John Sevoyce andBeaudwin Jacobe being the day before sailed for Allampo. I sent a canoe and awhite man thither soe scone as I received yours, but il was too late, soc shallwait the next oppertunity. 1336. Edward Searle James Fort, Accra, 5 Aug. 1698This accompanys my accompts for June & July. Desire the canoe may bepresently returned, with as many slaves irons as she can well bring, haveingnone but what arc in use. 1337. Edward Searle James Fort, Accra, 17 Aug. 1698Yours of the 13th instant have received. Am glad the sloope is arivcd in yourroad. According to your orders I have made enquiery affter come, but find oldcorne very scarce, and my expence at present is above a chest a day, whereforecannot give any assurance of supplying you here. I wiH get what I possib le can, and when the ship taketh the slaves shall put every chest I have aboard, butI beleive that will be very little, for I am dayly in hopes of more slaves. l havebeen hindered a few daycs by a small interloper English who is at Allampo, 157 : _ . which hath stoped the traders comeing hither. There he has his complement, and sailes this day or tomorrow. I omited in my last to advise you that six seys rated per inventory 1/ 3 damaged was sould for noe more then the vallue of 3oz 2a, as presume you have found in exammineing my accompts, which I notice now, that it might not be taken for an en-or, haveing sould all the refuged seys except them, and the best being all picked away, thought it better to take that then to Jett them lye in the warehouse, as they have done already this severall years, which hope you will not disprove of. This serves likewise to give you an accompt that some time since, haveing been to give a visit to my Dutch neighbour , whilst [I] was there happened a difference between a black belonging to the Dutch Towne and one of my boys , insomuch that the Dutch Black threatned what he would doe as I passed home, which my boy came and told me off, and I made it knowne to the Dutch Coapman, who sent for the man into the Castle. When he came he begged pardon, and said it was only words between boyes. However the Coapman confined him to the Castle, till I should be gone home , at which a mollotta named Brinee armed himselfe and tenn of his slaves, with one Amba, resolving to waylay me goeing home, and murder me, butt Briny by perswations and force of a Cabbosheer went home with his slaves. Nevertheless Amba still resolved on his bloody designe, which [I] knew nothing on till I was got about halfe way home , where in a cross path , the grass as high almost as himselfe, I met the villaine, which plainly appears had he not been frnsterated of his consort, they would have endeavoured to have effected their designe, and nevertheless would this Amba [have done so), had not I had four armes with me, for there he stood with his peice ready, cartooch box by his side and a shot in his mouth. When I saw him I bid my boys ask him what he did there. He gave some cross words in Blacks, 159 and asked for what the Dutch Coapman panniared his consort, and staying a little while, a Black belonging to the same Towne came to him and got away his gunn, soe I went on my way. I am apt to beleive that it was a designed thing to fall out with my boy, to cover their roaguery, haveing never had a sillable of difference with either of these fellows, or any in the towne, whicn makes me think they were set on by some Peter Passop, a cheife actor in Succondee tragedy, 160 being then there, who acknowledged he was told of it, but he was drunk and gone to sleep, which was his excuse to me the next day. This narrow escape of my life [I) was forced to be content with, as well for want of souJdiers as officers, which was our ganison well supplyed with the natives durst never offer such affronts, and commit murders as they dayly doe, tho ' ever so much prompted to our by our barbarous neighbours, 161watching and waitingwith patience to come up with these villaines. I have got Amba from aboard aDutch interloper. When I sent to the Captain, desireing him to paniar the roague,and acquainted him of the action, he prese ntly replyed should it be the loss of hisshipp and cargoe if he came aboard I should have him, and it happened that heimediately came, soe I had him sent me by the same canoe I sent aboard. nowI have him in possession. I desire you to order what shall be done with him.My time, if please God, being but sho11 here, am not willing to act any thing asrnay give occation for any to say after I am gone, that l prejudiced the intrestof the Royall Company or my successor, wherefore doe advise you that the Cabbosheers of the towns of Ningo, Bony, Tesha and Labbordee, 162as well as ofthe Deans, Dutch and my owne (towns], has been with me, and offers that theywill take fetishes that never any affront shall be given to the English in any ofthese parts any more, but will paniar anyone that shall any ways committ theleast affront and deli ver him up. My answer to them was my full designe was tomake him a slave or putt him to death, but that if they had effected their designeit relyed on you to seek revenge, wherefore should doe nothing but what youwould order, and that I beleived they would have a very hard matter to get himclear, on which accompt goeth this canoe and the bearer at their charge. PS. If you have any brass kettles to spare please to send one caske. [gap in correspondence, Sept. to Dec. 1698) 1338.
