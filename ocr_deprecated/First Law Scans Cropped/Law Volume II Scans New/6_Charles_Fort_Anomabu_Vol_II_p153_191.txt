VI CHARLESFORT,ANOMABU The RAC's principal establishment on the Gold Coast after Cape Coast Castle itself was at Anomabu ('Annamaboe' etc. in these documents), east of Anashan, and like it situated within the state ofFante ('Fanteen'). The Anomabu factory had been fortified earlier in the 1680s, and was known as Charles Fort -though this name occurs only occasionally in the correspondence for 1686-8. The other RAC factories within Fante, Egya (' Agga') to the east as well as Anashan, were subordinate to it. The Anomabu factory supplied principally gold, but also com for the provisioning of slave ships, and some slaves. The principal hinterland traders bringing gold to Fante, including to Anomabu, were the Akani. The Dutch West Indian Company also had a factories in this area, at Mouri ('Morea') to the west of Anashan, and atK.ormantin ('Cormanteene') to the east of Egya, which both are occasionally referred to in the Anomabu correspondence. The correspondence also records an attempt by the French Guinea Company to settle in the area towards the end of 1687, at Anashan (nos 572-4) and at Amisa (' Amersa), east of Kormantin , (nos 577-8, 580-1 ). In addition to records of trade, much of the correspondence relates to negotiations and disputes between the RAC factory and the local political authorities, mainly over the payment of 'customs', or customary gifts; such disputes forced the removal of two successive chiefs of the factory, James Nightingale in September 1686 and Ralph Hassell in August 1687. The Anomabu correspondence also refers occasionally to relations between Fante and neigh.bouring states, notably a war against Akyem (' Ackim ') and Agona (' Anguina ') to the east in 1687, and a projected war against Fetu to the west in 1688 -the latter in support of an exiled chief of Fetu called 'Ahen' . 1 382.

At my comeing from Cabo Corso about 6 or 7 months agoe, with his invitation went to Moria, and he in short being drunk tum'd me out of his room and made me lye all night upon the stones in the yard, would not permitt me to depart but kept me prisoner ; and as for the actions in June, in realty he ought to thank me, Captain Walker and Plumer, for affter were all abed, the second and serjant had a great falling out, by reason the serjant would not drink our kings health in so much that he snapt at the serjant severall pisto ls, broak two of Emsthus swords [and] my own cutlash, as per bearer will appear, and I being wounded in severall places to[o] parted them , in short severall men [sic], had it no[t] been for me, and to make it more plainly apear, enclosed is a letter from the second of Moria, wherein he plainly begs pardon, desireing me to excuse what was past the night before, saying he was drunk and that took away his honnour and reputations, and affterwards sent his assistance to me to Annamaboe to beg pardon and also desired me that I would not give the Generall an account, knowing the severity of the fiscall, which never have done, but only am bound to answer your Worships, and this is the real truth which will justifie to Emt hus face weresoere [= wheresoever] I se him, without your Worship and Generall of the Mine make it up, you will certainly here more of it, knowing that my great master the king and the Royall Affrican Company of England will protect tbeir servant against any of the Dutch unlawfull and ihosteH actions. Tomorrow God willing will send my monthly account. Am not well is the reason I doe not come up, being much trobled with vomiting, also Walker. 426. James Nightingale Annamaboe, 13 July 1686 Received your Worships and accordingly have sent up Mr Jonston and with him my monthly account.

Where the error lay know not, which pray be pleased to consider. As to the error in my accounts , have sent two new, which are rectified, and the ballance of the same.

James Nightingale Annamaboe, 22 July 1686 Whereas there is an order from your Worship and Councill that if Mr Blinsham shall want any goods which I have, am to supply him, and likewise he the same to me, this morning sent Mr Walker with a noate to him to send me twenty five blew perpetuanoes and twenty five green ditto or the half of each, which be denyd, saying he was not obliged to send his best goods, but yet notwithstanding would not [sic] send them ifl would sent [sic] him gold answerable. These perpetuanoes I had take mony for before. Wrote your Worship yesterday , was a mistake of Bryan Ingles and the and [sic] canomen, in sending on shoare one cask pewter which belong to Mr Blinsham, who sent for [it], but being late thought not proper, so gave him a receipt. For want of currant goods which he's supplyd with the Arcanyes are forced to goe to Agga , as they tell me themselves. I can't obtain a receipt of Mr Blinsham for the two slaves delivered him per order of your Worship and Councill, niether have the fare correspondence as was promised per him before your Worship. 433. James Nightingale [Annamaboe], 26 July 1686 Your Worships of the 23dinstant received , and have according to order demanded the gold for the 53 dozen knives of Mr James Walker , but he tells me that what he had in cash [he] sent it home per his brother and Captain Pickard , so that if your Worship thinks convenient will stop it out his sallery. As to what your Worship writes that Mr Blinsham is not to be excus' d in not sending of the perpetuanoes according to order, is certain , therefore pray for the future let me have an order in writeing, to send for what goods I shall want from Agga, as Mr Blinsham has to demand of me, which order at all times per me has been observ' d, and for my part I covet no more goods than what is for present sail [= sale], haveing, as formerly write, received gold for them, and have also a good quantity in custody for perpetuanoes, sheets and doe beleive if your Worship had them you would supply this ffactory, and without that you cant expect a trade, I being forced to Jett the Arcanyes goe to Agga and other places for want of the same, and as for liveing quietly with Mr Blinsham that is my only desire. Shall for the future be very cautious in corresponding with him only what shall be realy for the Royall Companys intres t.

How long the gold has been there or per what means it came there he knows not, but Mr Blinsham made a contract with him early that morning for two bendies, if he could find a parcell of gold, which he had lost two dayes before between such and such a place, shewing him very nigh th e place were he took up the gold.30 Have had promis of the canoman which carried of Mr Blinsham, that they would goe when I ordered them, yet when I sent for them, [they] fall off, through the means of one person at Agga, which I cannot yet find out. Have sent up Pheny and the slave Jack. Pheny was interpreter beátween my selfe and Mr Blinshams cano men,31 who[ = Pheny] will give your Worship a tiue relation of what they said . If per any means it is possible rightly and truely to understand it, Ile certainly obtain it.

I demand'd a veiw of them and his answer was he would part with bis blood before I should se any thing, for which reason I confind him last night in this forte. I hope your Worship will approve what I have done. I leave him to your Worships justice, but I think him a very ill [= evil] man and shall sattisfie you at my return. I have ended all palavers at Agga and given Mr Nightingale quite[ = quiet] possession, 32 only given away one case of spirritts and have received back one say which is pa ied to the Company credditt. 441.

This morning we are inventoring the warehouse, which as sun[ = soon] as done shall come up to Cabo Corso with the furst opertunnity.

Have winded and clean'd the corn at Agga, but in short it is all veavell [= weevil] eaten and full ofbuggs , suppose for want of cleansing room and looking affter. I will doe my endeavour to preserve it as much as possible , there being 123 chests. I sent a sample of the corn at Annamaboe and asure you is all in this condition and not so much as a veavell in it. I have thrown a good quantity of mallegetta in it to preserve it. Am heartyly thankfull for what you have been pleased to intrust me withall, I doe not question by Gods blessing but to discharg my selfe with all ffidellity and will endeavour to promote my Masters intrest. Shall not be ungreatfull to Mr Walker and Mr Perring according to merritts, and give an account according to times . Have also received back from Cabo Corso John Sellick , which can testifie per all our people he is a greate rouge , haveing broack open <lores and hinges and stoln abundance of things , likewis e a great mutinus unsivell [= uncivi l] ff ell ow not to be trust'd in Castell, haveing denyd your order severall times, and makes his brags that you have not punished him but give him liberty to doe what he pleas 'd, therefore pray lett me desire you to consider it that the rest may not ffollow his examples. Pray send me against 10 a clock tomorrow, 200 green and blew perpetuanoes and some sheets, I haveing a great quantity of gold in custody for the same and more a coming, pray doe not faile.

Have taken all imaginable care in suning [= sunning] and winnoing the com, which realy is verybad and extreamly full of severall sorts of vermine , per which if not prevent' d will be quite spoild. Desire your pleasure in sending me on account of the Royall Affrican Company fifty blew and fifty green perpetuanoes, also would desire you to send a chest with bouy [=buoy] and roape for the better security of conveying the Company gold when you shall please to order. 446. James Nightingale Annamaboe , 11 Sept. 1686 Yours of the 7 and 8 instant received with monthly accounts.

If yon doe not send me some perpetuanoes presently , must restore the Arcanyes their mony. 448. James Nightingale Annamaboe , 14 Sept. 1686 Desire you on receipt of these to send me down Doctor Griffin, who may make a right understanding between myselfe and Capushers, who are at variance through their insolences. Pray faile not, fearing the ill event, for will not any longer suffer the daily affronts as [formerly, it being a disgrace to the Royall Company &c and impossible for any to live here, except other method used. 449. James Nightingale Annamaboe, 18 Sept. 1686 Yours of the 14th instant have received with ffifty blew and ffourty green 16thperpetuanoes, and yours of the instant. Shall supply Captain Daile with what come am ordered. All differences are ended between self and Capushers. You will here the whole relation per Mr Boylston, and how insufferable we are daily abus'd. Have received this day of the Arcadians [= Arcanians] 7 mark of gold. Am promis'd a great quantity more if am supplyd with good perpetuanoes of each coller and also sheets. Would desire you to send me what have offten wrote for, and which is really requisite for the preservation of the gold in retume where [= whether] you shall thing ffitt to order a good chest. 450. James Nightinga le Annamaboe, 21 Sept. 1686 Yours of the 16th and 20th received. In answer to the first, although not suffen-ed myselfe and none of the Company servants nor no attestation to be made per Mr John Boylston in our behalfe, of severall gross abuses per the natives, not sufferable to be borne withall to the great prejudice of the Royall Afr ican Companys intrest. 33 Likewise that threat[n]ing of Mr Boylston affter comeing from Cormanteen, telling me be would put me into irons and send me up to your Worship , and so to be sent to the Royall Company , which saying I did not understand, I seing no such order from your Worship and Councill, that was the reason I told him my mony was at Cabo Corso, but the next morning proffer'd him the mony of both ffactorys, before Mr Elwes and Doctor Griffin, he refusing the same, saying I should lett it alone untill further orders. I sent on account of the Royall Affrican Company of England twenty marks of gold for Annamaboe and three mark more for Agga per Mr Robert Elwes. Your further orders shall be obeyd at the months end, and it shall be alwaies my meathod to keep the count clear, and pay the ballance of the same, which at all times will contradict undermineing people. Have been fore' d for want of goods to deliver the Arcanys their mony back againe. I doe what I can to dispatch Captain Daile, who has aboard two hundred chest of come. 451. James Nightingale Annamaboe, 23 Sept. 1686 21stYours of the instant received. In answer of what you write about the Companys servants to be sufferers [it] is realy trew [= true], which can justifie , for last night and this very day, some of them ware like to be nockt down at ssentrne by the v[ u ]lgars, without any affront shown to them by us or any justice on their side &c. If your Worship will be pleas'd to look upon your letter dat'd the 24th of June last, wherin you were pleas' d to mention that if the Capushers did still persist in their rougeryes that you would then send a sufficient supply to suppriss their insolencies, and without that the Royall Company intrest and servants will be dayly abus'd. As for my part am not able to doe more than I have done , and it is more difficult for a factor that lives here to answer all their pa llavers than to pleas' the Royall Affrican Company , your Worship and Councill without a man bribes them, which for my part shall not doe, being a servant to the Royall Company and not to the Blacks, although their parts being taken by a falce info1mation and mine and the Royall Company servants here being never hard[= heard], which is hard measure. Have deliver'd Yaboy 34 his pawne as per enclos'd will make appear, for which he gives your Worship and Councill thanks. If their be any abuses showne by our people at Agga, shall rectifie it, and will endeavour to purchase three or four hundred sticks of wood as per order. Have deliver'd Captain Deal three hundred chests of come. He will take in noe more, haveing bought the remain 's now. As to any pallavers concerning the Royall Companyes intrest, for the future think it most proper to be done by your Worship and Councill , and according to that order shall act. The Blacks are more likely to stand to what[= that] which is done than any propositions or atticles made per any ffactor. 452. James Walker Annamaboe, 6 Oct. 1686 Have put on board the canoe twenty five chests of come, which the canoe man said was as much as possible she would carry. Have received ffourty boysadoes, greate part of them being much ffaided, and also thirty pewter juggs much bruis 'd, wbicb the Arcadians approve not of. [PS] If please to send good juggs can vend to the vallue of 18oz. 453. James Walker Annamaboe , 9 Oct. 1686 Att nine this night received yours. Nothing shall be wanting mine, in endeavouring to live peaciably and quietly with the natives , but it is not my will but theirs must be done. Their good success in their rogeries bas brought them to such a bight that they esteem and vallue a white man as nought , and as for the Castle, they say can distroy it at pleasure. Likewise say no man shall live their as Cheife but whome they approve off.35 Hope will not impute it ill in giveing Mr Nightingale whome you orderd my Cheife, an answer of his letter. Shall as a servant to the Royall Company study to discharge my duty in all respects . The Capushers as yett are indifferently civil!. The Curranteers dayly dun me for their custome, saying that what Mr Nightingale gave them was as a dashee and not as their custome. Shall treat the Capushers to the utmost of my abillity, which is to give them ffaire language, and more am not capible of. 454. James Walker Annamaboe, 10 Oct. 1686 Am just now private ly informd per Comander James that the Braffo and Curranteers intend tomorrow to shut up the gate, the reason know not, they this morning seeming to be very kind, only was very desireous of knowing who should be their Coopeman, which told them know not, but did beleive in two or three days time there would be one according to your pleasures, this is what passed between them and selfe, parting very civilly. Leave it to your construction. 455. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe, 14 Oct. 1686 These accompany's Mr Samuell Humfryes, who will give you a true narrative of all our proceedings, since our arrivall here; and that the lowest these people would come down to which is agreed on to pay them , vizt to the Capushers of Annamaboe two sayes and one anchor of .rum, to the Braffo and Quarrenterrs the same. To write att large would be to prolix . therefore beg your excuse and leave it to the narration ofMr Humfryes, who also imports the inventory's of both factory's with their last months accounts, also what mony Mr Perrin had received. The Arcanyes this morning came here and demanded affter some small debate, one say and a case of spirritts, which they say was always allow' d them, soe would intreat the ffavour to enquire of Mr Nightingale what he gave, that l may not exceed in any think[= thing], and what your Worship will allow, for more Ile not pay on the Company acco unt at present. Will not overtyre your patience with an over large epistle, by reason of Mr Humfryes speed, but will enlarge as opertunity occasion's. Ifbave omitted anything, pray lett me be advis'd in what, which will endeavour to supply the defect. 456. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe, 18 Oct. 1686 My long silence was for want of subjects, soe begg it may not be imputed neglect. Since my being here, which is a week today, have taken noe more mony then one ounce, which was for iron bares. Nothing of trade presents by reason the Arcanyes are gon up, but in few dayes they will return. Th e comodity I want at present is rum, which I begg may be supplyd with. Heare is never a cano belonging to the ffactory, which upon occasion will be much wantd. I have had many fair promises but as yett noe pe1formance of a trade. The men here has not been paid for the last two months due the 8th instant, and all the mony here will not be suficient, being in all, with MrWalkers takeing in MrNightingales absence, 7oz 7a 8ta; but as soon as have enough will pay them. I am anxious in mind that I cannot give my Masters noe better encouragement, but time that brings all things to pass, I hope will alter the currant. (PS] Since what is writte above have received your orders which shall be obeyd. 457. James Walker Annamaboe, 22 Oct. 1686 Yours by the 17 hand cano with 3 casks of rum have received, and have returnd per her what goods of Mr Nightingales she is capable of carrying; and shall returne the[m] when ordered. Shall be very carefull in all the Company affairs. 458. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe, 25 Oct. [16] 86 This morning I haveing takeing mony for stript sattins but have none, soe request I may have some sent as soon as possible, and by the return of the canoe will send up two good men and two women slaves. Asheddow being a verry dilligent ffellow and one who hath the ear of all the Arcanyes and as far as I perceive rules them here, he by Affidoe or some other means understands that your worship is not well affected to A ffidoe, which indeed there is no reason of affection towards him; and in fine Ashadoe would nay can officiate the place of a linguister better than Captain Dickall Affidoe; soe desired me to write to you that he may have the sallery he had, and promises to bring all the traders here; I request your answer. Here is a great quantity of mony , but for those goods which I know is not at Cape Coast, so shall not nominate them. All things are quiett and in a good composed estate here, which I will endeavour to keep soe, for the benifitt of my imployers. Had any thing of moment presentd would have advised, and shall as occasion offers. Have sent up 7 bolts, 1 piece long irons to be mended, also two cold chisells. Have not another here, which begg I may be supplyed with. 459. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe, 29 Oct. 1686 These I send on purpose, being much importunated by the Arcanyes for two or three hundred of brass neptunes, not of the largest size, those from one pound and a halfe to two pound. I sold just now all that I had, being 146 which has layne by here for some months, all at 6ta per pound , and have received 7oz 8a for two hundred and forty pounds. I fear the stilliards are naught; I request the weight of them, to know whether I am wronged , and the next parcell will retrive the loss if[so]. Here is mony some quantitty, but for perpetuanoes blew, sheets and such goods I know there is none at Cabo Corso. I beg that the neptunes may be here by tomorrow at noone. On Munday God willing I purpose to send up Mr Walker with this months account and the ballance, with the slaves advised in my former . 460. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe, 1 Nov . 1686 Yours of the 30th ultimo I have received, togather with 369 brass panns. There wanted two of what you writt should bee; and are not of the sorte the last was, which they doe not like by reason they are bright within and tumd in streaks on the outside, and are to weighty. I have sent a sample of the sort and size they would buy; if they be a verry little size bigger and lesser, it matters not much. They tell me they have two marks for such when your Worship pleases to send the cano with such. If there be any pray send a small bunch of good large rangoes. I hope I have committed no error in not sending the cano away yesterday. !fl have I beg pardon: but all circumstances considered aright, I did it to save the Company's charges, for if I had not detaind her, I must today have putt the Company to 7a charges, to send up the slaves with the ballance of Octobers account, which I now by Mr Walker send, being 4mk 6oz 6a as per the accompts inclosed will appear. Also 4 men two women slaves: I have not in Octobers accompt charged them sent, being the 1st October, nither have I given credditt for the brass panns by reason my accompts were ffinished before they came, and desire an order that they may be retumd. Here is two roles of tobacco, I know not the weight nor price. Here hath been severall to buy some, but know not how to adventure. I suppose it is the Company [sic], I would willingly be inform'd of the matter and 1 shall alwaiyes be ready to observe all your commands and use my utmost dilligence for my Royall Masters intrests while I am in their servis. 461. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe, 2 Nov. [1686] Yesterday soon affter Mr Walkers departure I received from Jonas Penin by the bands of James Griffith bis Agga account for October with the mony for the baUance thereof, which yesterday I examined in the presence of James Griffith, and hope it will goe safe, had a better opertunity presented would imbraced it. The Arcanys yesterday inquired for corrall and desired me to write for some, which if any begg a supply with the price per string or per ounce. 462. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe, 4 Nov. [16)86 Yours of yesterdayes date is safe come to hand, and have likewise received two cask of neptunes contayning three hundred and five, one bunch of rangoes containing fourteen hundred and ninety beads, which I wrote for as soon as any man demanded a sample to buy some. You seem somewhat dissattisffied at the charges when I came here, which I will assure you I really paid and was agreed on by Mr Humfryes and myselfe , and was the lowest they could be brought to, which we did beat as low as we were able. The letters at present I cannot find, but suppose the coppy is with you , by which as well as my memory dictates to me was to be as good husbands for the Company and come of as cheap as we could, which I take to be the substance of the letter. Ampeteene 36 this day came to me and sayes Mr Nightingale ows him 11 chests of come. I would know of him wheither I shall deliver him his pawn which he gave me, or elce to write me what the difference is betwixt for [he] sayes he will paniar on his head to the vallue. Now if he writes me word I will end that difference. There is not a day but I am troubled about his concerns. Ashedow has a great command of all the Arcanyes and told me today that none should come to trade here unless Mr Nightingale sattisfies him, soe leave it to your matter and due considerations to adjudg how disadvantagious it is to the Company that trade should be hindred for frivolous matter. The two casks of rum containing 77 gallons of rum is gon to Agga, and this cano now brings from thence 15 chests of come. I have not paid the slaves for the last two months; they are at me this two dayes for payment , soe request what each slaves pay is, that may sattisfie them, and in what. [PS] I have also paid Asheddo 5a for Mr Nightingales account rather than loose trade, which he really ows him, as letter per bearer can tell what he said. 463. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe , 7 Nov. 1686 Yours per Peter I have received togather with two hundred iron barrs, and doe conjacture that by soe small a matter as the raiseing the price from 28 to 26ta I shall have smalle sayles this month. The letter at length I have se[a]rch [and] found in a booke in which I was fformerly reading , and have here inclosed sentt it you. As for the come in my accompts it is 348 chests, which would easily apear by my receipt for all things in the ffactory. The beads I have since weighed and there is 780 pounds , soe begg it may be mentioned in my accompts. As for the come , I beleive few Commanders will receive such if they can have new come. I have likewise received Bonashees 37 pawne, that is his armring, which when he comes to demand it shall be delivered according to order. I have delivered Jonas [Perrin] his accompts and bid him rectifie them. On F1ydaye I with Mr Walker [ went] there 38 where we inventoryd the warehouse , and find if it be true as he saith that he trusted Quabba with three sayes , ifl have not the mony by tomorrow night I will againe take an exact accompt of every thing and demand the mony for all that is wanting, which ifhe makes not good your Worship shall here thereof, and then I beg If not before to have your possitive order, for I fear he is not as he should be. I beleive more than ordinary fate attends these places. There shall not any damage attrew [= accrue] for the future to the Company soe far as it lyes within the sphere ofmy capacity to remidy. 464. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe, 7 Nov. 1686 Since my sealing of my letter of this date which goes likewise by this canoe, Bonashee came and demanded bis pawne, which I tendred him, and when he saw [ms. 'say'] it he refused it, by reason he had not the neckring with it, which he sayes he has sattisfied for both and if be has not that you may keep both, this to pardon me that I rite you soe for this was his expression and many worse. Had above two howers dispute and would have him to take it, but he utterly denys it unless he hath the other with it, that is the reason Petter staid soe long , and hee understood and heard all the pallaver and can tell you the truth at large, if a black may be beleived. I have here enclosed the receipt which would have him sign; also have per Peter sent the ring back, he refusing it. 465. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe, 8 Nov. [1686] Yours of yesterdays date I have received, and according to order sent this morning for Bonashee. He is still on his same string, harping to have the other ffittish,39 and sayes that Murrowando was his kjnsman and that he neaver had any thing to doe with that neckring, and that when he pawned it to Mr Richard Thelwell 40 he [=Murrowando] was Braffo; and that it was their custome that whenever a man is made Braffo be canot see the salt watter, and he sayes that last slave and five angles was in full for boath the pawns, and that he will take a ffittish before Doctor Griffen, and any other white man you will send down, if you will not beleive him then bee desires the slave arnd five angles againe. This palaver has taken up most of this morning , I have inquir'd of severa!J wheitber Murrowando be liveing, some sayes yes at Annian, 41 others sayes he is dead long since but not byryed , soe bow to beleive them I know not, but I beleive be is dead. I also demanded of him that if any of his [= Murrowando's] ffreinds should ever demand this ffittish, he answered that he had neaver anything to doe with it. Shall immediately goe to Agga and there with Mr Walker inventory the warehouse and demand all the mony for all goods wanting, which if he complyes not with sha ll then ffollow your worships orders, but then I fear a future charge will then ffollow by putting in another, nevertheless Ile doe my Masters the justice they shall not be wronged or I myselfe injured as little as may bee. As soon as he has finished his Octobers accompts will send them up. 466. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe , 9 Nov. 1686 According as I wrote you yesterday I with Mr Walker went to Agga and inventoryed the warehouse there, where found all the goods wanting as per the inclosed note amounte to lmk lo I la 10. I demanded the money for the goods as I did the time before, he [= Jonas Perring] told mee he had trusted most of the money and ifl would but stay a day or two he would endeavor to gett itt in all and bring i.t mee; I replyed this is your old pleay which you promised on Ffryday that ifI would tarry but till Munday I should then have itt, and that I then cam for it and would not be putt off any longer, and allso taxt him with this letter inclosed which hee sent mee on Sunday, whereof you may playn!y perceive the roguery of this ffellow. Farther James Griffin verryfyed it to his face that he saw soe much as his noate specified, which after soe taxed he humed and hawed and could not tell whatth [sic] to say, butt looked and shuffled things about, to looke if any money would appear. Att length be looked and found a bulce with fittishes and other beads and some money, all weighing butt 60 4a bare waite; I beleive the beads and ffittishes were botTowed. I had not been there a quarter of an hower but people swarmed about us mumbling and grumbling. I sent out scouts to understand what might be the meaning and in the pallavering hous it was sayd and agreed amoungst them that if Jonas was sent away noe other white man should come there. I made an end as soon as I could and brought away the key of the warehouse [so] that noe other goods should be imbazled, and I fear ifl should send Mr Walker there they would doe him a mischief or any one elce, which make mee in truth amazed and require your farther order. I fear by his speaking Blackes42 it would be a difficulte matter to gett him away. Never was any man soe plagued att his firste entrance into an imployment as I am, what with trobles and noyse here and disquietting my self aboutAgga [so] thatl have not aquiett houre in a day, and haveing so small a trade and soe great expence discomposes mee, butt patiance and hope my dayley companions has not forsaken mee. I humbly begg your speady answer and order to proceed in the affaire. 467. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe , 10 Nov. 1686 Yours by Toby of yesterdayes date received the last nighte, and in pursuance to every one of your commands I have ffully effected and hope will give and render your Worships contente. I have now likwise thinking itt matteriall sent up the money with ffitishes and as I received itt from Jonas Perrin and sealed whith his owne seale, and by whatt accompts he renders your Worshipe you may adjudge if whatt I have advised timely off be not reasonable to cleare mee of any defecte in relation to my Masters concerns, for I have done the parte of a servante that I would not Jett them be any ways sufferers. The messenger that I sent for him tells mee that the house was full att Agga and making pa llavers on James Griffin keeping the key, which I order'd him and sent another man there yesterday, not adjudgeingit safe [that] Mr Perrin should have itt any longer by reason he complyed not with promise, and fearing that goods to a greater value might goe to hatch money to make the other good, and having th [ o ]roughly sifted out the matter I fin de more bran them [= then] meale; yett by reason I paste[= passed] my word to Cabushers and likweise to him before them, I would doe him no injury, soe begg you would be as favorable as in equity may bee. I feare all is not over yett, for a little of sparke kindles a greatt fire, and the firste smoake thatt appears Ile not fay le ofrendering immediattly advise. It would in my opinion be verry nessessary that a Ch iefe should be there, and not under this place. I am not covetious of itt, for if I should longer take the charge under such a one there, I should weave the webb of my owne woe and spinn the thread ofrny thralldome. Ifl should expatiate on this subj ecte I could not be held a fflatterer butt rather a suffragante to truth. I submit to your candid judgements. 468. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe, 11 [Nov. 1686], att 5 in the morning Last night between the howres of 7 and 8 I received yours darted the 10 currante toga th er with teen chests of sheets and two bayles of perpettuanoes. Coming soe I.ate I opened none butt deferd itt till this morning, I hope all are well and true according to what you mentioned. The canoe men were somewhat to blame in not looking better in coming a shoree, for the canoe shipd watter and wetted the cheste much. I will open all to see if any damaged, which I hope the beste. I had an indefferent good trade yesterday, I tooke aboute 2 mark and moste for neptunes and bassons; the neptunes are almoste gonn, and I hope today to have a good markett for sheets and perpetuanoes, for as soone as I received the goods in the warehouse laste night I was promised two more tomorrow, for blew perpetuanoes, butt I told them I must sell green with blew; they told me they would not give butt 7a for green, to which I answered they should have noe blew then. Iron barrs as informed your Worship stickes ahand since I rose them by order to 26 per bendy and have not sou ld one, soe what I have must ly longeer on hand or order to conttinew att 28 per bendy. Although I have endeavord to exercise the vivacity of my small capacity to bring them to it, it is as much to the purpose as to blow feathers againste a stonne, and if I have hitherto committed any e1rnrs, which 1 hope not, I doe avow to repay that debt which the intreste of all my best endeavors and your commands shall be ever with mee and absolute law; and soe far hath my duty to you lead mee to subscribe ever only I begg by firste conveniency aboute 20 or 30 deales to make place above stayers[ = stairs) to take mony in, for have not any place fitting for that purpose, allsoe a carpenter. 469. Ra lph Hassell Annamaboe, 12 Nov. 1686 I wrott you yesterday morning I expected a verry good trade, which I might have had if would have sould all blwe [= blue] perpetuanoes without green, soe I sou ld butt two. Thee green will not fetch 6a apeice, I am suree it was noe good husband1y to pull all the fillits of, for that exposes the damage to veiw and does them noe good. I request your speedy answer, for they will buy none butt blew; if soe, I then can dispose of double the quantyty this month , or if any new greens be come to send some. I sould two chests of sheets yesterday and hope to have ready money in a shortt time for all. The neptunes are likwise now in demand, I have sould all and wante a supp ly of more of the same sortte I now send a sample by the bearer; ifa little larger some, it would not be amiss soe they be verry slight and light , for they esteem of number as much as weight: the last held out verry good weight. Quashee 43 was whith mee for to pay him for four hundred of wood and three chests of salte which was for the Coast frigatt, Mr Henry Wood Commande r, the wood att four angles per cent , the salt att 3a per cheste. If Mr Nightingall has not paid or charged itt I begg your resolve about itt. The come roome will be finished by tomorrow night, on Munday all the slaves shall goe and thatch the ffactory Agga. 470. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe, 15 Nov. 1686 1 had wrote to your worship on the 13th instante and then had sent it had it not been for Yabboe, who then <::am to mee [ and] makes a demand who should pay him six bendys which he lett Jonas Perrin have for ballance his October accounte till Mr Humfryes and 1 cam downe, Jonas telling him he would pay itt againe as soone as the Arcanyes cam to trade , he then telling him be had as much in cracra money but he knew that Mr Humfryes would not take itt; and Yabboy is resolved to have itt one wayes or other , soe I begg your Worship and Gentellmen to examine him stricktly aboute itt, butt I verryly beleive he will give as little insight into that as in all the reste, being alltogather obstinatte, and he must have all his money, for the blackes say that he never was a spendthrift. I have now sent up his tmnck with papers, which will stand him in as much stead to make up his accompts as if nothing had been in it, it cam openn to mee, and soe I send it your worship. Here is now noe money stirring, by reason one Captain John, Captain Dickes brother ,44 the last weeke went up to Cabo Corsoe aboard shipp, where he purposed to lay out six markes , butt not finding the goods he expected retturned and gave this answer to the Arcanyes and Cabusheers, that he h[e]ard there was two greatt ships to windward , soe the money is all stopted for a trade aboard them. I pray send per the first conveniency a bale of broad tapseeles and a cask of three pound pwetter [= pewter] basons and some stripitt sattins ifany of the same sortte laste of 5 ft 5, butt pray whatt is sent Jett them bee off a deep reed and a gold couler and if att that rate 30 or 40. The green perpetuanoes hinderes the sale of the blew. I turned the come yesterday and itt is extremely dusty, and being old the weavell increases dayly, [I] doe what I can and if it be not verry speedily expended itt will be altogatbar invalid, I writte nothing butt the truth; if any one gainsay itt, lett him be a spectator and an impartial Judge. I have bought noe come as yett nor can not, for feare of this spoyling [the] other, though in a remotte partte yet vermin wi II spread abroad. 471. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe, 22 Nov. 1686 Yours of this date I received about two houres since, and as soon as I received itt sent for all the slaves which belonged boath to Annamaboe and Agga which were buissey there, and as soone as they cam sett them at worke to through [ = throw] all the come out from the roome over the kitchin and to carry itt in to the greatt yard to winnow itt and dust itt and then to putt it in the roorne which I have now coverd, by reason there is noe weavells or virmin, and the roorne where itt was Ile indeavor to cleare from all buggs &c, and if in one weekes time I see itt growes weavely Ile remove itt againe, and there shall be noe care wanting to save it. I have sent your worship a sample ofboath according to order. This verry day I turned away money for all the blew perpetuanoess by reason they would not buy one green one; if you have any good green att Cabo Corsoe pray send 20, butt if they be the least touched they will not buy them. I have now by mee aboutt tenn marke of gold, and if may sell the bl ewes singley question not butt they will all be gone suddenly with other goods , soe begg your answer. The barer can informe you that all hands are att worke in order to your commands. If any thinge of news by Captain Butteram I begg a line. In the napkin you will find a noatt which is Annamaboe, and that is the best come. 472. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe , 3 Dec. 1686 Yours yesterday I received with two hundred iron barrs and two hundred and fower brasse diglins, all which shall dispose of according to order. This canoe alsoe returnes with 30 chestes of come from Agga, alsoe all the broad niccanees that weare heare, all as I received them being accompted ninetye and a remnant in baggs. Heare is sletias and carpitt in a bad condittion, and what to doe with them I k.nowe nott, for they are nott vendable. Likewise all the things which belonged to Jonas Perrin goes herewith. Since my being att Cabo Corso all the sheets are gon, soe desire as many chests as your worship cann well spare, for withoutt them I shall make butt a small months accompte. All thing es are in a quiet condittion here and well. This is the key of Jonas Perrins cheste. 473. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe, 7 Dec . 1686 I received yours last night, att which I was amazed to heare of such complaints. First against niccanees, I had recourse to Mr Nightingalls accompte, and found noc narrow nor short as I remember thearin; and for the come, itt was very well dusted I will averr when your worship ordered itt, and being the very bottom of the flower[= floor] and soe many buggs remaine in the come roome, they presently entred againe, and all the heart being eaten some durst will reman in the hallow husk. I heare is now butt teen chests remaining att Agga, from whence the other 30 chestes went. This heare I take as good care of as any man canne, and will for every thinge else. If you will please to inspect the inventory you may see many dommaged [sic] goods, which you will all grant I cannot mend, butt my care shall be to preserve them. They have been twice taken downe and brusht, which is as Mr Walker sayes more than was done in 6 months before, and shall bee every month, and oftner ifnessesity requires. Since my beeing heare I have advised for noe perrishable commoditye. The accompts shall bee sentt God willing tomorrow. They had gone today butt in a morning I am favored with many vissitations whch cannott shunn, though never soe much buissness. The Arcanians are just now gonn to fetch money for 20 barrills powder , which they say shall have in the afternoon; how to beeleive them I know nott, butt praye a suply of that commodite tonight if possible. Bonnishee is with mee att this instant and these are his very words, the Agent Blackman[s] good freind and doe all Black man very good, butt hee noe savee for what hee noe love mee , butt I love him and tell him to make all pallavra succaba, Ile give him a very good woeman and then hee send mee the two pawnes and then Umbra Cooshie, that is to say a finall conclusion. 45 474. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe, 7 Dec. 1686 I wrote your worship this morning that the Arcanians had been with mee for powder and that they would bring money this afternoon, which since I have received for 16 barrells, alsoe for 1: 2 and 3 pound pewtter bassons , of which I bage [= beg] you would bee pleased tomorrow to send 20 barrels powder, 400 1 pound bassons, 200 2 pound, 200 thre e pound ditto, for have past my would [= word] they sha ll have some tomorrow. They are very importunate for sheetts, which I tould them I beeleived theare was none. Here is a greate quantite of money and more would dayly come had wee butt such goods as they want, which I sha ll nott nominate knowing theare is none to suply me with all; what I now write for I hope tomorrow early to receive. 475. Ralph Hassell Amamaboe [sic], 9 Dec. 1686 Last night per the cano I received both your letters togather with thirty barrells of powder, four chest sheets, three hundred two pound pewter basons, two hundred three pou nd ditto. The major part of the basons I had mony for, soe hope in a shorte time to send for more of the same commodities , for I doe not hold it discression to send for great quantityes at a tame [= time] , for then they will but blow upon goods, and being soe near where I may suddainly be suppl yd will cause a greater eagerness in them to take what I have. Bonashee last night sent in a woman slave according as he promised and hopes your Worship will be as good as your word. By this cano I have sent up three men and one woman besides that of Bonishees, also according to your Worships order twenty chests of Annamaboe come, which I will say is clean, and so is all here or that shall come from hence. The accompts I have sent up all signed by myselfe, and the errors rectified in James Griffins time. I want paper much. This is the ultimate val[ u ]e of what I have. 476. Rice Wight 46 Charles Fort, Annamaboe, 13 Dec. [1686) Last night we got safe down and meat with a civil reception. This morning early in order to your command began the inventory [ of] the warehouse, which I find more difficult than I apprehended, by reason of the damaged goods, soe that I fear I shall not dispatch in the time limitted , but what I came about shall be done effectually . Several of the damaged sayes are sold to Captain Quashee. I shall not enlarge . 477. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe, 14 Dec. (1686] Yours yesterday with three hundred two pound pewter basons and two hund red three pound ditto and four chests of sheets have received. Have concluded the inventory of the warehouse here and am just goeing to Agga. This cano carryes 2 men 1 woman slaves and 20 chests of com. Mr Whiteing is arrived and somewhat indisposed and will stay till to morrow to refresh himselfe. Shall if your Worship thinks convenient towards the end of the month waite upon you with my accompts and the ballance. [PS] The woman that was sent last was Bonashes. 478. Rice W ight Annamaboe , Charles Fort, 14 Dec . (1686] Your letter of yesterday date have received by Mr Elwes. Your orders therein shall be observed, [he] being this morning goeing to Agga.4 7 Last night ffinished the warehouse here and hope to com pleat all this night that I may return to Cabo Corso tomorrow. [PS] Powder is verry scarce. Mr Whiteing[s] cano is in sight and since came on shore, but much indisposed. 479. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe, 15 Dec. 1686 This accompanys Mr Rice Whight, by whome goes the inventory of boath ffactoryes signed under our hands according as ordered, with the accompte of what goods has been disposed of, since the 1st of the month. I have nigh twenty marke of gold by mee for boath ffactorys, besides all the people paid this month. I am hartily glad off soe good a neighbor as Mr Elwes, with whome will bare so ffriendJy a corTespondence as may be, and question not butt itt will be for our masters intrests. I hope all things will be to your satisffaction , and then my joy att present is compleate. 480. Ralph Hasssell . Annamaboe, 15 Dec. J686 Since what I wrote per Mr White a chapman 48 bas prese nted for good markt iron bans, which I have not any good ones left which they approve of, so pray send per first conveniency , tonight if possible , three hundred. [PS] I begg some paper of both large and small. I have 4oz for barrs. 481. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe , 17 Dec. 1686 Your Worships yesterday by the 17 hand cano with three hundred iron barrs is received. If any defect in the inventory , as your Worship and Gentlemen signifie, it shall be corrected and amended . I have since told over several! goods and find them more than what was inserted in the inventory, and in my monthly acount. All things shall be rectified. The sayes Mr Wight sold had like to be returned again, for Assina blowing of the mony and finding it so bad that he tarried and took up a great deal oftim, as indeed it required time to be well pickt. Quashee after the departure of Mr Wight, was in such a rage that he would return al! againe. All the mony I have sent by itselfe, as also that for the ffactory of Agga. I humbly begg your excuse that the account is not transcribed, for were a sheet of paper to be the ransom of the cuntrey, l have it not, and I have wrote for some more than once; I am brought to the necessity that I am constrained to return you part of what letter is sent to me, which this is by Ridly Horsford. Your order is obeyed for I have sent up in all 20m 6oz 12a, all that I have by me for both ffactoryes. l have not elce to add but humbly return you thanks for your invitation at Christmas, which if health permitt shall not fayle to kiss your hands. 482. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe, I 8 Dec. [ I 686] The bearer being an Arcany man is sent on purpose to be sattisfied whether your Wo rship ordered me to sell iron at 24 bares per bendy, which in the mergent 16th[= margin] of your worship and Councell of the instant it is so, which I observed according and will let none goe under. I have this morning by their approbatious [= opprobrious] language abused and they say I keepe the mony my selfe for 4 bares which in Mr Nightingales time they use to have 28, so pray sattisfie the bearer it is your order. They say they wil I all leave this place they tell me, as the bearer will inform your Worship. Here is mony for powder and sheets, and more dayly expected. I have for two or three dayes been endeavouring to raise the price of powder to 18a, the Dutch haveing none , but cannot, but doe th inck at 10 [for] 1oz to put a quantity of[f], if they are as good as their words. I should inlarge had I paper, I beg I may be supplyed by the bearer. 483. Ridley Horsford Charles Fort, Annamaboe, 28 Dec. 1686 Last night Mr Elwes and selfe arrived at Annamaboe, and this morning Mr Walker is bound for Cabo Corso in the cano we came in. As for what I have seen he bath left all things in good order, belonging to the Company concerns. In the meantime shall be careful what lyes in me. 484. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe, 30 Dec. 1686 According to your order yesterday morning we began to inventory the warehouse, and today by noon shall compleat it and tomorrow your Worship shall have it. Yesterday in the affternoon the Cabusheers were with me for their accustomary Christmas dashees and told me today they would have it. [ desird them to tarry untell such time that I heard what your Worship and Gentlemen would allow, they answerd they would not be delayd, I had been at Cabo Corso and that you had orderd me to give what other men had done before me, they were sure, and that twas not mine but the Companys pleasure to give it them, and that they wou ld have it. I endeavoured what possible I could with reason to perswade them to mittigate the charge, telling them that the Company was at great charge when I came here; but all argument proved to no purposes for they told me I should not debar them from their right wh ich had been given them by my predecessors. Their iosolency is in realty so great that it is not sufferable. These begs your Worship an answer, what was given the last year, for so much they say they will have, I beleive rather more than less for they talk of great matters . Pray take it not amis that Ridly Horsford stays so long, tomonow he sball return. If your Worship think it conven ient I will send up the mooy that I have. 485. Ralph Hassell Annama boe, 31 Dec. (16)86 I here inc losed sent your Worship an account of all the goods in Annamaboe. I have delivered Boneshee his two pawns as per the inclosed receipt, so desire mine againe. He would not sign to a receipt for the pawn in Braffo Munanadoes [sic] name but as his own. Have now sent up 4mk 3a of which two ounces is on Agga account. I am almost bated to death with these people. I desire your Worship to speak to Mr Nightingale to give me advise how he disposed the dashees and to whome. This cano takes in but 10 chests com by reason of Mr Walkers things. 486. Ralph Hasse ll Annamaboe, 1 Jan. 1686 [= 1687] I received yours yesterday dated the 30th ultimo, at which tbime all the Cabusheers with many others were assembled together makeing their demands for their severall Christmas dashes , which I would have a baited as much as I could, but they rather stood to have it augmented. I could not stay them of a minute, they would have itt and more to. Now Asheddo is Captain of the Arcanyes and another second, be tells me that your Worsb.ip promised him a cloth, which he insists on and sayes I detain it from him , although yeste rday I gave him a red perpetuanoe and a case of liquor, which he sayes is usuall to the Arcanyes besides a cloth to the Captain and second. He threaten no trade shall come without two cloths of IOa price be given him and second, pray your answer. Though yesterday I ended with the men I have still a great plauge with the women, who will not Jett me alone; which way to take I know not, fair means work not, I am almost att my witts end, I wish three or four dayes over that I might be at quiett. Have not elce fa1ther to add only the messenger is sent by the Arcanyes to know your pleasure. 487. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe, 4 Jan . 1686 [ = 1687) Haveing this opertunity by Captain Peter of conveying my December accounts with the ballance, have thought it requisite to send them, the mony being l mk l oz 6a for Agga accounts till Mr Elwes time. Your Worship shall receive them as soon as they are finished, which I am now about; you had received them long since had I not been inteITupted by the noyse and darners of these peop le. I received yours ordering the purchaseing of com but as yet have not got one chest, but as it comes in will render advice. When I was at Cabo Corso one of the Arda men49 went up theither, and as yet is not come down, his name is Hans, desire your Worship to send him, or another in his roome. Here is no trade by reason of two ship[s] here and one to windward. [PS] Just as I was sealing this up I received yours intemating the complaynts of the Cabushers saying the Castle is cold, if it be hotter I am sure I am not able to continue in it. The allowance of rum goes but a verry small way in the heat, their is not a day yett hath passed over my head since my being here but it hath cost me a gallon rum besides the double monthly allowance. What they would have is brandy and that I am not able to afford; to be more liberall of the Company goods I will not, and ofmy own I cannot, and in that I consider the Company intrest. I am very willing to be at quiett but these are a people trobled with a nunquam satis.50 They never complayned to me of what you intimate. This fellow was sent on purpose to acquaint you that I wiU not take Fanteen mony, 51 which they bring in great quantityes and bad, nither will they suffer it to be well pickt, which will be to my loss. Ask Capta in Peter, he witll tell you it is the reason of their complaint. 488. William Halford Annamaboe, 8 Jan. 1686/7 Mr Hassell and myselfe are now takeing an inventory of the warehouse, of which I had sent your Worship a coppia, but takeing a particular account of all the goods to se wheather they have been cut, takes up more time than I did imagine. The first opertunity I will send up an exact coppie, in the intrim I hope you will be pleased to excuse [William Halford]. 489. Ralph Hassell Annamaboe, 9 Jan. 1686/7 Yours of the ih instant I have recei ved by Mr Halford, to whome shall shew civillity. The Cabushers are now all gon into the cuntrey. I have not received one chest of corn as yett; this that is here growes dayly worse and worse though I doe my utmost to preserve it. Tomorrow shall finish inventoring the warehouse. Here is now no manner of trade by reason of two ships here and others to windwa rd, but hope the next week it will mend.
