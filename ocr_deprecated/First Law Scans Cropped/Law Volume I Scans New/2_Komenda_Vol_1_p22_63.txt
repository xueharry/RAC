II KOMENDA The RAC had a factory at Komenda ('Commenda', 'Comenda' ), east of Sekondi,from at least 1673;1 but this had been abandoned in 1680, when it was thought tobe under threat of atltack by an African force,2and was clearly still unoccupied atthe beginning of 1681. Letters elsewhere in the RAC correspondence (nos 496-8)report that a vessel of the Company, the African Merchant, called at Komenda inAugust 1681, but found that 'no trade' could be done there. In November 1681, asthe letters reproduced in this section show, the factory was re-established. Its sub.sequent history, however, was chequered, being again abandoned in September 1682, again re-established in January 1683, once more withdrawn in May, and thenagain re-established in October of that year. The Komenda factory served princi.pally for the gold trade , though on at least some occasions it also supplied com toCape Coast Castle; there are only two allusions to the supply of slaves (nos 63,71) . The Dutch WlC had also had a factory in Komenda earlier, but this too hadbeen abandoned by J679;3 in 1681 the building was still unoccupied, and in ruins(cf. no.35). An attempt by the Dutch to re-settle in Komenda was thwarted by theEnglish factor in January 1682 (no.53). In November 1682, however, during thetemporary absence of the English, the WIC again decided to re-establish itsKomenda lodge, and this time the project was carried out;4 the English thus founda Dutch lodge in place at Kornenda when they returned there in January 1683(no.85). But this Dutch lodge was also abandoned in May 1683 (no.112). Thispattern of discontinuous settlement partly reflected disappointing trade, but thewithdrawal of both English and Dutch factories in May 1683 was further provokedby a local disturbance in Komenda. Komenda was situated within the state of Eguafo ('Aguaffoe' in these docu.ments), with whose king the English factory there periodically negotiated. Thedistinction between 'Great Commcnda' and 'Small (or Little) Commenda' occa.sionally made in these letters alludes (respectively) to the royal capital inland and the coastal village where the factory was located. The principal local person with whom the English dealt during 1681-3 was 'Captain Bracon (or Abracon)', a 'Little' Commenda , who did much business on commissionsubstantial merchant of for the RAC.5 The most important hinterland merchants who brought trade to Komenda were the Akani ('Arcanics '),6 though one Jetter (no.107) also names the Twifo ('Quiffers') alongside them. It appears that traders from the interior norm.ally approached Komenda through the state of Abrem ('Abramboe'), immediately north-east of Eguafo, since early in 1683unspecified disputes within Abrem report.edly interrupted their passage (nos 92, 102). 32.

The Generali ofthe Mine sent some dayes agone hjs Chief Cabbisheer Aban9 to Chama,10 Jabie 11 and the Antha country 12 to agree with the natives not to bring theire gold to Com.menda, he instigated them as much against the Engli.ishas possible he can; but alas the whole country hates him from Ashanee to Fanteen,13 and as for this place they have broken downe the factory to the ground , and stolen away all the stones that was for the building theire fort. I could wish the ship was here to stop theire mouths. 36. James Nightingale Commenda, 18Nov. 1681 Just now came a Commenda man from Axim who was aboard of a Dutch interloper: Dino interloper tould the Blacke that he left at Ashanee and Abbene 3 English shipps, whereof2 belong to the Royall Company and that they thought to be downe within IOdayes. The Generali of the Minas Cabbisheer is mighty bussie, Aban by name, about resettling of a factory for the Dutch, also for turning us out. Ditto Aban has sent for a great many musketteers the which past by this place this day. They have also a difference with the natives at Chama. The factory they are settling is Succondee.14 This being writ in hast begg pardon. Comme nda, 22 Nov. l 681 37.

James Nightingale Commenda, 2 Dec. 1681 Your honours dated the 29th November came safe to my hands and have punctuallyobserved the same. Cabisheer Agamaco has been with the King and told him yourhonours comma nds, his answer is that about 4 yeares agoe he sent 5 men of hisrelation to assist a Portuguese in selling his goods and buying his slaves, but dittoPortuguese come ing to Wyamba 16 to leward carr ied them clearly away, and were never heard of since. Ditto King has had no occasio n since came in place to demandsatisfaction of any Portugue se, but this man hee suffering 4 of his men to lye ashoare, which aforesaid men told the blacks that now was the time to have satis.faction, which one of them is by name Emanuel!, a great rogue , for he has been inservice both of us and Danes. I have seen him whipt alt the gunn att Capo Corsoe severall times. Hee intends to serve your honour , I have tum'd him out of the factoryand broke his head. After the 4 men were ashoare ditto Captain came ashoare, andafterwards his boate. I told the Capain pray goe aboard in your boate, the blacksintend to take your ship, but hee being a low hearted man was afraid, and that timehis ship was not [sic?] taken. Ditto Portuguese Captain has been with the King, whotold him that hee should have his ship againe, and when satisfaction was made forthe 5 persons his relation, hee should have the remaynde r now taken repaid eitherin gold or slaves, and desired to know what he had lost because them that tooke ittshall not steal any of the goods. Now as concern ing our factory to sustayne anydamages or the looseing any of the Royall Company's goods, your honour will be pleased to consider the contract between your honour and the King and alsoe their pawnes and our strengLh and commands upon the coast, alsoe the great charges the Company has been att in settleing itt. J doe assure your honour when the factory was last removed, 17 the King was the person that sent 300 men to our assistance, and brought Captain Seaman, Captain Hill, their mates, doctors, myselfe, Griffin {and) the Royall Companies goods safe off the shoare. I did not loose the worth of a cracra.18 The King sends mee word that as long as Bracon is all the waterside and his relation and hee hi mselfe above att Great Commenda, that the haire of one of the Royall Companys servants shall not be touched, much less the loss of the Company goods. And as to my person pray rest assured your honours commands shall alwaies by mee be observed. According to orders [l] send my Accra ac.counts.19 Your honour will find that Mr Hassell will give the Company creditt for the I ounce, 5 angles and 10taccoes in his account; if not [IJwill pay your honour and demand of Hassell the same. There is a Portuguese shipp alt Axim. [PS] Mr Wender presents his most humble service to your Honour. Commenda, 3 Dec. 168141. James Nightingale This accompanies the Portuguese Captain, by name Emanuell Consalves, whoe left his smack in this roadc. Ditto Captain reports that his ship is not serviceable to saile to St Thoma. Soe having noe more onely referr myselfe per Jetter to your honour by Cabisheer Agamaco. Commenda, 4Dec. 168142. James Nightingale I have received your letter and according to your order, have demanded of the blacks of this place whether they are willing to part with the Portuguese ship, whoe have freely consented that she shall be carried to Capo Corse. Tomorrow I shall give your worship a more particular answer to your letters. Commenda, 9 Dec. 168l43. James Nightingale According to your order I have been aboard the Dutch ship, whoe hath brought a cargoe of 10,000 pounds prime cost, from Middelborough, many sheets but few perpettuanoes. The news in Europe is that the King of France (alias French King) hath banished out of his Kingdome all Protestants.20 The Prince of Orange hath been of late in England, and tis supposed uppon noe good intent.21 One of the chiefest lords in England is put in the Tower, the relater not knowing bis name. 22 The Duke of York is in England, and in great esteem both with King and people. 23 There is suppos'd to be a war between Sweden and Denmark, but not yett publish.ed.24 This ship has brought two factors, three Assistants and 7 souldiers, sailed out of Zealand the last of October. There is a ship coming from Amsterdam, with a new Generali by name D. Peere, whoe was formerly one of the Lords of Zealand , and is dayley expected here.25 Captain Balck tells mee that there is above 5,000 marks of gold in cash att the Mine and what the Generali intends to doe with it none knowes. The first ship that sailes from the Mine to Europe will be Captain Leendart Joosten van Dyck, with two of the small ships more. Itt will be the latter end of January before Captain Balk will depart. Both these Captains presents their humble servants to your worship, and will be glad to serve you in carrieing letters for Europe, or any thing elce that lies in their power but begg pardon that they cannot waite on you att Capo Corsoe. As for paints , linseed oyle, and the draughts of the coast I will procure for your worship if possible. Last night passed by two ships but know not what they were. 44.

Pray be pleased to send 20 sayes and as many herba longees for supply of the factory. [PS] AlJ the sayes are sold. 45.

If Deeter Mead cannot come pray send the docter of Captain Starland and alsoe halfe a douzen bottles of small beere, I haveing nothing to assist a sick man, onely brandy and mum which is not good in this distemper.

There is alsoe goods came from aboard with the Royall Companys marke. Ditto Woodfine intends to anchor att Tagarada tomorrow. Captain Brackon and other marchants here desires your honour to grant me the liberty to take out some goods which they want, which are consigned to the Castle for present payment, itt will alsoe save canoe hire. I expect your honours order, PS. If I should gett any of those rogues aboard, which has abused the Companie s trade here, also the canoe gentlemen, pray give me an order to the Companys Captains that they may keepe them and bring them to Capo Corsoe to your honour . 47. James Nightingale Commenda , 20 Dec. 1681 According to your honours order [l] went aboard of the Dutch ships att the Mine , the skepers reports mee that they think to sett saile the 2nd January Dutch stile,27 but they are notcertaine either before or after, but my oppinion is that will goe very suddainly by reason the people that imbarks are aboard. The names of the skepers is as followeth, Leendart Joosten van Dick, Commander of the ship Roterdam bound for Roterdam ; Marinue s Willmess Commander of the ship the Armes of Zurch Zee, bound for Zeeland; Machiell Joosten Commander of the ship Minyder.bergh, bound for Amsterdam. Any of the aforesaid skeepers will carry your honours letters safe. I am satisfied that there is arrived att Dickiscove an English ship pretty big and of good force, supposed to be a Company 's ship. Wee may hope of Captain Woodfine being there. PS. I would advise to wright your letters as soon as possible. I found Mr Wender preny well, praised be God for itt. 48. John Wender Commenda, 20 Dec. 1681 Althoug h my weakness renders mee uncapable to write much, yell I should will.ingly in a few Jines shew my gratitude to your worship for your kindness in sendingthe Docter to my assistance as likewise for the beere, for which I give you mosthumbl e and hearty thank s; I thank God I have not had any fitt since Satureda y nightsoe doc hope tis gon, on ly I continue still very weake, whic h is noe more then usuallafter such distempers. Sir I have nothing elce to add, only desire your worship toremember mee if any imployment should present that may be better then what Ihave already. 49. James Nightingale Commenda, 22 Dec. 1681 Your honours dated 21 instant I have received, alsoe 20 pieces sayes, and 20 herba longecs and halfe piece red cloath, for which shall give the Company creditt.

James Nightingale Com mend a, 28 Dec. 1681 Accor ding to order, I sent your honour 19 brass kettles, one being sold since Twasatt Capo Corsoc weighing 5 pound. The reason the canoe stay'd soe long the bearercan give your honour an account. [PSJ Pray send per this canoe, the man slave . 51. James Nightinga le Commenda , 5 Jan. 1681/2 Your honours dated ultimo December came safe to my hands. As to an answer, thatas soone I heard the slaves run away I sent irnrnediatly to the King, Captain Braconand the Marccne 28 to procure them for us according to contract, but they never cameashoare here, itt was above 6 miles from hence towards Jabin. As to the two slaves being paid [for] I la apiece I never heard of itt. The Captain never came to rnee, if [he) had [I) should have told him your honours contrac t, itt is his owne fall for heplainel y told if the blacks had asked a bcndy a head he would have paid itt, for hehad a selfe interest in ill, which I beleeve he has for not one of the 12 slaves arebought for the Compan y marchandize, but [they were) absolutely panyard with authe teeth they had. I know 4 of them myselfe which are great traiders att Ce stus, Ihave been ashoare with them both alt Cestus and Basha.29I beleeve the next English ship will pay for itt. Docter Griffin and I have done our endeavour to gett the slaves, wee have gott 8, two are aboard before and two drownd. The king has had a great deale of trouble alsoe, wee heare, to gett the slaves, they being disperst in a great many places. As for your honour blameing my unjustice and Captain Bracon[s] ill conscience [it] is undeserved, as Docter Griffin will give you.r honour a particular account. Wee humbly begg your honour not to blame us for wee have committed noe fault, and as to abuse received att the factory, there has been none comm itted onely that the ships in the road have taken aboard above 160 marks in gold and wee to the contrary ashoare none at all, which may be very well supposed att the rates they sell their goods at and wee haveing none to supply them , but now I hope your honour will be pleased to send mee what supply your honour can spare mee per first occasion. In short, here is gold if wee had good currant goods and the rates accordingly, which I humbly begg your honour to consider, itt being the winder .most factory where shipping sells their goods soe abominable cheape. I send your honour my December account, you will be pleased to consider, that itt is the month of charges, being the first settleing, and I assure your honour itt has cost mee not little besides to gett the natives to bee friends with our masters the Royall Affrican Company, which will without doubt for the future be for their profitt if your honour continues this factory; if not am of opinion that the Dutch , French or other nations will soone inhabitt itt, which to the contrary in our possession noe other nations can doe itt, and wee once being removed itt will not easily be gott againe. The King of Commenda presents his service to your honour and understands by reports that the King ofFettue 30 intends to make war against him. Hee desires your honour to know what the reason may be, either if his person or people are abused or if hee or his 31country owes him any money, hee desires your honour to write mee an answer.In the meanetime I take leave and referr the rest to the report of Docter Griffin whoe will give your honour an account in general!. 52. James Nightingale Comrnenda, 24 Jan. 1681/2 This is onely to give your honour an account that I have received 4 peeces of boysados, 25 perpettuanoes, 6 3 lb and 30 4 lb pewter basons, 36 looking glasses, 30 brawles, 50 Guinie stuffs, 10 course sletias, 20 silk longees , 12 course blanketts, and 130 sheets, for which shall give the Royall Company credit 53 . James Nightingale Commenda, 19 Jan. 1681/2 Your honours dated the 17th instant per Mr John Smith came safe to my hands. As to an answer of the fire itt is as followeth. On Monday being the 16th instant thefire began abou t 8 a clock at night about 50 paces to windward from us, whichconsumed within less than . of an hours time above 200 houses, occasioned byone frieing of fish in palm oyle. The old Queene and Captain Bracon lost all theyhad, only saved their gold, and as to the Royall Company's concerns att the heateof the fire Ill was afraid that I should not save one cracra worth but the great mercyof God Almighty and assistance of my boys and Commcnda people saved all onlyI chest of sheets, 21 lead barrs, 5 31b pewter basons, 28 41bditto, 85 chests of come,10 pewter jugs. The remains [I) have with Mr Smith compared with my accountsand book s and found that did agree. The lead barrs, jug gs, baso ns, were in theroome with the iron [and?] are melted, I have saved of itt as much as possible could.The sheets were in my owne room which are co nsumed with most part of my ownegoods. As to the come [I) had bought and paid for 129 chests, whereof is remayningabove 40 odd. I doe assure your honour if such an accident had befallen the Dutch, they would not have saved one penny's worth. The Dutch heareing that our factorywas consumed with all the Royall Company's concerns, were very hott to settletheir factory, but I have stopt their designe, and what is possible of the contract shall be observed. Here is in the road a great Frenc h ship between 30 or 40 guns, about200 men.32 I told the Capushers last night to remember your honours contract, andthat none here should come ashoare for [IJ intend absolutely with Captain Braconsassistance to hinder all them that should act anything prejudiciall to my masters theRoya ll Affrican Company. Here are likewise in the road two English interloper s,the one called Captain Young the other I doe not know. I desire your honour to sendmee your order and Councill if any come ashoare to hinder their designe. I desireyour honou r be pleased to send some body here to see what is best to be done aboutthe factory, either repairing this or to build where the factory was formerly, andwhat length and breadth your honour will be pleas'd to order it. I also desire yourhonour that you would be pleased to consider the loss and charge I am act, also toallow some gratuity to the people that soe trnsty assisted mee in saveing the Com.pany's goods, and especially Mr Harper for his care in the midst of the fire, for weeall were afraid the factory would blow up by reason of the powder. If my opinionmay be excepted I could advise what is to be done, and att the least charge, aboutour factory. Soe haveing no more to inlarge only refcrr the rest to the report of MrSmith whoe will give your honour a particular account. In the meane time am in adistressed condition as to my person but the Companys goods are secur e. [PS] The reason I have not wrill before was for wa nt of inke. 54. James Nightingale Commcnda, 21 Jan. l681/2 Last night understanding by the black s that there was a differance between the English interloper and the Frenchman in this road thought fill to send this morning aboard the French ship to understand the reason because I might give your honour an account of it, which is as followeth. Mr Harper comeing from on board the Frenchman reports mee that the French Ca ptain sent his boate with his Leiuetenant aboard of Cap tain Young an English interloper and demanded in the King of France his name his pass and commission but ditto Captain rcplyed you French dogg gett you gon with all your people out of my ship or else I will kill you, and said wee are the King of Englands subjects and an interloper, and bid him come aboard to figh t him, whereupon hee made his guns ready but the French leiutenant comcing aboard told his Captain all transactions, whereupon the French Captain with his marchant Monsieu r Bardoe [var. Bordoe] 33sent a civill answer in writing to the interloper desireing not to be soc bold for hee would doe him noe harme here, but as soone as the Frenchman had understood of your honour that the English man was an interloper and noe Royall Compa ny's ship, [he] would doe the Royall Company that service as soone as once was to leward of Capo Corsoe, would take the inter.loper above mentioned; the which in Monsieur Bordoe [var. Bcrdoe] marchant whose [= his] name and their companys seal 1 send your honour inclo sed, [he] reports that his ship came about 3 months agoe from Rusborg very near e Rochell, their old company being broake, and haveing a new one34 very desireou s to settle in these parts, and to that intent gives great encouragement to the Blacks, alsoe that dayly here is expected two Frenchmen of war with a General! and marchand ize, goods and materialls to settle the Gold Coast, especia lly to build a fort att Com.menda ,3~ which by contract has been agreed 10 yeares agoe , for these people here sent a black to France whoe spoke with the King himselfe. 36Therefore now is time for us to looke after our masters the Royall Affrican Company's place and interests upon the coast, and if once being gone itt will not be easie to gett them againe, especially Commenda, Wyamba, Succonde , Laguc 37which arc privilidged places to the Royall Affrican Company of England.3s 55. James Nightingale Commenda , 24 Jan. 1681/2 Your honour s dated the 21st instant came safe to my hands. [I] am glad to heare that your honour has been pleased to consider that I have done my endeavour as to the saveing the Royall Company's marchandise from burning and other damage. Itt was noe more but my duty, but doe assure your honour itt was difficult, but hope by the blessing of god almighty never to see such an accident att Commenda againe. Your honour has been pleased to command my small opinion about rebuilding the Royall Companys factory , which is as followeth. Att the first place in my opinion itt will be more profittable and secure for the Company to rebuild the factory where itt was formerly or there about, by reason itt is the only place to build a fort at, it being higher ground then any place att Commenda; alsoe [it is] the Royall Com.pany's owne ground, itt is to windward of all the towne, to prevent fire, in short a small fort being built can command both sea and land. Secondly am advised by Captain Bracon and others here, that if your honour dus not resolve to sett both the people of Great and Small Commenda very speedily about building the old factory, that the raines will goe neare to prevent the finishing of itt, for I count but 3 months till the raines comes in. In the interim the people are willing to give mee their assistance in rebuilding this house for the security of the Companys goods and interest untill the other be built, and that att as little charge as may be. Therefore my desire is your honour will be pleased to keepe a good and faire corespondence with the King of Commenda and the people !here soe that they and I may know your honours orders and designes, for I am confident they will doe what lies in their power for our advantages and assistance, both in the rebuilding and tradeing, as yesterday I have found, for haveing according to your honours orders notice of their tradeing with the French and other ships I sent my complaint to the King, whoe immediatly sent for the people of this place up to Aguaffo, whoe are not yett return'd but [I) have had advice from thence that the King made them take the fittish not to buy any goods aboard of ships provided wee had them in the factory or cou ld procure them in 15 dayes time. Whatever your honour is pleased to conclude on for the rebuilding I desire your honour will se nd a fitt person who may survey the charge the Company will be att either for building or rebuilding , as likewise to contrive what may be done and att the least charge and best convenience for the Royall Companys interest, that in this case I may be blameless for any extravagan .cies of charge, for I am resolv 'd not to extend the limitts of your honours order. As touching the French I have noe other information then what I have writt formerly, only that Monsieur Ducas comes Generall 39 with two men of warr of 45 gunns apeece , and one small frigat and two sloopes to settle upon this coast. Att present here noe transactions of any importanc e, only Captain Bracon with the rest of the marchants here and I thought fitt to send Captain Coffee to give your honour an account of all pasages and to know your honours commands. if your honour pleases to grant metigation of the prizes of your says, Guni stuffs, brawles, alsoe silk and herba longees, itt is probable next month may take some gold. This month the Companys ships and others have sold soe cheape that I have had noe trade hithe1to. The people who were soe trusty in assisting mee in the fire, dus dayly call out for some recompence according as I promis'd them in my extremity, to which I desire your honours order per next conveyance. Commenda, 28 Jan. 1681/256. James Nightingale Your Honours dated the 26th instant I have receive~ and understand your Honour will be pleased to build a factory for the Royall Company at the old place it was fonnerly, but I begg your Honour to give me the libe1ty to build a little higher, to be understood the place where a fort may stand, it being hard by the old factory but better situated, also tO inhedge soe much ground in for the Royal] Company as possible can, for now is the time, and when l receive your Honours model and directions shall endeavour to carry on the affaires according to your Honours order. The people here give your Honour humble thanks for the gratueity, and I have paid them in silke longees the worth of a peece of say, which does incourage them and upon all occasions [they] shall be at your Honours commands. Yesterday ar.rived here a small interloper bound for the Bite,40 his name unknowne. Captain Young is still in the road. I here of noe ships to windward. Commenda, I Feb. 1681/257. James Nightingale Your Honours per Captain Coffie dated the 28th January came safe to hand, and shalJ according to your Honours resolution observe your order therein, soe in the building and prices of goods as have been formerly ordered, but if your Honour pleases to give 25 peeces of Guinea stuffs per benda I can dispose of 500 presently. The reason I sent the rates of the goods to Capo Corsoe was that the Arcanics and others was infonnd that I vaJ!ued higher then Capo Corso rates, but now to the contra ry they found their error. I send your Honour my January account with the ballance of the same to Mr Spurvay41 amounting to 7o 15a 2ta, also 2o 5a 9ta being the ballance of my Accra account42 and 5o 9a 2ta being the baJlance of December account of Comenda factory. The reason wee had noe more gold this month was because soe many ships of the Company, French and others have been in this road and undersold us, also the great disturbance of the fire. In the meane time am repairing this house for the safegard of the Company goods, till the other be build, which will come to some small charge. I will doe my endeavor to bring it soe !owe as possible can. 58. James Nightingale Commenda, 11 Feb. 1681/2 I having nothing of inportance to advise your Honour only that I heare of a greatEnglish ship to windward, supose it may be the St George.As to our building cannot possitive give your Honour an account, having apalavera with the King and waterside people about it. Also a designe to turne someof the great rogues out that hinders our trade and assist interlopers, therefore praysend me downe one of your Cappusheers, that he may heare the palavero and giveyour Honour an account. It is not for our harme but profitt, for all is well heare. [PS] Pray lett your Cappusheer be here in the morning. 59. James Nightingale Commenda, 15 Feb. 1681/2 Your Honours dated the 11th instant came safe to my hands. [I) answer that all thepowder remaining last month was sold the 5th instant, for as soon received yourHonours Jetter presen tly have shewed Hansico the warehouse as he can give yourHonour an account. As to come I have in all 85 chests. If your Honour pleases to order me to giveI. angle per chest I am of oppinion can procure a good quantity, for course sletias,green perpcttuanes , or gold, for other ships give 2 angles per chest.As to the reason I sent for one of your honours Cappusheers, was this, that Iwould have these people know that your Honours comands in behalfe of the RoyallAffrican Company of England should absolutly be obteined, and would knowbefore wee build the factory the reason it was not on theire side accomplished, andespecially here being soe many rogues of other countrys that went aboard of shipswithout leave, that I would panyare them. They not beleiving me sent of several]canoes with musquells to take them and put them all from aboard an interlopercomanded by Captain Been, which occasioned a long and strong palavora, but atthe end [I] made the merchants and Arcanies take this country fetish that noneshould goe aboard of any ship to trade contrary to your Honours articles, and alsoeprendee'd43 them three sheep, whereof your Honour will receive two from thetransgressers, but it has been chargeable to me, besides [11paid 12 angles in goldand one anchor of brandy, the brandy was spent in the 5 dayes palavora, and the12a was given to the fctishmakcrs and Cappus heers. The Comenda merchants andArcanies likewise paid to the Cappusheers and fetishmakers 1 ounce 8 angles ofgold besides the Kings Mareen. Yourhonour haveing formerly ordred me to incour.age these people not to let any other nation come ashoare was the occasion, soe thatfor the future wee may here order your Honours comands, which shall at all timesbe observed in what lyes in my power. As to the building of your Honours factory tomorrow the people intend to goe about it, they demand IO anchors of brandy for the whole charge of building , halfe in hand the other halfe when it is build, and that according to the draught, for they will doe their endeavor to have it finished before the raines. Pray let me have one or two slaves that has expeare nce in building for assisting and directing the work.men. There is at Axhim Captain Nicholas Van Home in a ship of 36 gunns, his second with 24 ditto, and two Branderburgers of good force.44 They are full of goods and lets noe trade be where they come to anchor. I would have written more at large but am not well, therefore pray pardon me, the rest I leave to Cappusheer Hansico who will give your Honour a generall account. 60. James Nightingale Commenda, 20 Feb. 1681/2 This accompanies Captain Daniell Gates, to whom I have delivered 103 chests of corne, 85 at I a per chest and 18 at l .a per ditto as per his rece ipt. As to the charge of givein g the people the fetish Hansico was wittness to the particular disburse.ments. In referrence to the building of the house, upon rece ipt of your Honour s order for giving of the 10 anchors of brandy, I called the Cappusheers together and gave them advice thereof and of your Honours pleasure for their provideing of doors and windows but they told me the brandy they desired was only for a dashey and that they expected besides that 3 marks in mony for the building, whereupon I disperst them in great anger, but Captain Bracon being loath [it] should goe soe brought the Cappusheers here this morning and by his perswasions in presents of Captain Gates did offer to take the fetish to have the house build before the raines providing your Honour would allow 5 bendaes vizt the one halfe in hand the other halfe at the finished of the worke and this for the whole charge of building without any dasheys except what I am willing to give of my selfe, which your Honour may consider will not be little, I being dayly among them when they are at worke. As to the doors, doorcases and windows it is unpossible for these people to gett, this country not affording wood for that use, wherefor I hope your Honour will be pleased to supply those necessaries from Capo Corso, also some pickaxes and iron crowes. As to preventing forreigners landing at this place, I hope my endeavor shall prove an.swerable to your Honour s demands. I desire your Honour to send me for the account of the Royall Company for the supply of this factory, some broad and narrow niccanees, tapseels ditto, white long cloaths, course sletias. course blanketts, all sorts of pewter basons , likewise.casque of brandy. I have sent a merchant to Capo Corso with 6 bendaes of gold to be bestowedin copper barrs. I desire to know how many you give per benda , and if the rates bereasonable, it is like may prove heare a commodity vendible.I begg your Honours speedy answer concerning the affaires of building by myboy Tom who brought your Honours pacquctt from de Mina. PS. As yet can give your Honour noe account about the Deanes[= Danes] slavesfor had noe answer from Aguaffo. 61. James Nightingale Commenda, 23 Feb. 1681/2 Your Honours of the 22nd of this instant came safe to my hand , per order thereof Ihave this day delivered to the Cappusheere s 5 ounces of gold according to agree.ment who are well satisfied, and doe faithfully promise the accomplishment of thefacto1y before the raincs. I have sent this canoe chei ny aboard of the ship at the Mina for your Honourspacquett, whoe I doubt not but shall receive it, if ever comes to the Captains hands,for I did never heare any thing of your pacquett before which wayes I had writt forit with the last conveniencey. I desire you would be pleased to send up one of the blacke brick layers tooversee the building for whome wee now only waite, delaying the foundation forone fill person to direct the same, likewise the crowes and pickaxes are muchwanting for the worke. I also desire your Honour will bepleased to send me by thisoppertunity upon account of the Royall Company 30 gallons of brandy, for thecarry ing whereof I have sent 5 anchors. I am uncapable of writing at present by reason of a lamene ss both in hands and!eggs, it is a very bad distemper in this country and hath keept me since Mundaylast. I take it to be the same desease that troubled Captain Seama ns. I begg yourHonour to acquaint Docter Mead with this my desease, that he may send up whathe knowes convenient for preventing the same, and ifDocter Asskin be in the CastJeI begg your Honour to send hjm up for applying of Docter Meads directions. In my last by Captain Gates I forgott to give you an accoun t of the charges Iwas at in putting the come aboard which was in all 8 angles. 62. James Nightinga le Commenda, 3 March I 68 l/2 Your honours dated the 24th February have received, alsoe 32 gallons of brandyfor the which I have given the Company creditt for in my February accounts whichI send per the bearer, alsoe the ballance thereof in gold amounting to Mk 1.4.5.4tato Mr Spurvay . I am sorry that our buildjng does not goe on according to my desire, which is only occas ioned by the wanting of crows, pickaxes and shovells , for the ground is soe hard it is unposs ible for the people to worke ill without those neces.saries, which l hope your Honour will send upon receip t hereof, as likewise a fitt person to direct the worke, for itt will not be without great trouble, labour and difficulty if this building be accomplished before the raines which I expect about the 25th of Aprille next. Here is in this roade an English interloper which sells his says att 14 angles per peece and other goods proportionable. There is likewise a Dutch interloper at Pompandee.45 There are noe other Engli sh ships to windward that I know. 63. James Nightingale Commenda, 3 March J68 I/2 I send your honour by my boatswaine one good woeman slave for the Royall Company's account. Pray Jett mee have a recei pt, as alsoe a man that can direct the worke and the materiall s which I wrill for this day. All the pe ople are working this day to breake clay. 64. James Nightingale Commenda, 15 March 168 1/2 Your honours of the J2th and 13th instant I have rece ived, as likewise Yankey with his malerialls ,46 but am sorry you term my charges extravagant seeing I have charged nothing but what was clearly disburst upon the Companys account. As to Mr Winders busieness I hope you will be pleased to allow of seeing I paid him his sallery in goods out of the warehouse haveing had noe order to the contrary. Ac.cording to your honours order soe soone as haveing notice of the arrivall of any of the Companys ships [I] shall endeavour to acquaint them with your honours co m.mands, I being very sencib le of the Dutch their treachery Lo our nation if they can effect ill either by sea or land, therefore I humbly thank your honour for your kind advice thinking itt fill if ill please your hono ur lo send one to Dickiscove to preve nt our peoples landing all Axim or any of the Dutch windward places. Just now is returned my boy from the Mina whoe brings mee an acco unt of the pacquetts good dispatch as you may plainly see by the inclosed letters. 65. James Nigh tingale Commenda, 5 Apr. 1682 I have sent your Honour by this canoe (being afraid to send by land) my March account with the ballance thereof to Mr Spurvay which is Mk I: 7: 15: 2. Ca ptain Shears arrived here upon Monday night47 and I have done my endeavour to pur.chase come for hjm but can buy none cheaper then 2 angles per chest besides thecharge for carry ing itt aboard whereof I gave your honour advice in my last of the29th March. Pray send with the first conveniency upon the account of the RoyaJICompany for supply of thls factory 100 niccanees narrow, 200 Guynea stuffs, 6boysadoes, 4 chests of sheets, 20 sletjas course, 20 course blanketts, pewter basonsof all sorts. These are the goods wanting here atl present and the marchants beingcome downe does keep their money for us, therefore I begg your honour to send upthese goods with all speed, if delayed I feare they may buy their goods either of theDutch or interlopers, there being two to windward. If your honour does not thinkilt safe to send the goods by the 15 hand canoe be pleased to order Captain Shearsdowne for the same and if the price of the come be acceptable shall purchase whatpossibly I can against her retume. I beg your honour would order one man slave from aboard of Captain Shears for the use of the factory. Captain Bracon humblythanks your honour for your lcindess but the knives being alwayes sold au I angle per dozen [he] sendelh these back as too deare, therefore bee desires the Captainwould send him his money or knives alt the ordinary price of 1 angle per dozen.Soe soone as Captain Shears comes downe to Cabo Corsoe (I] shall send Yankyalong with him I haveing noe more imployment for him here. 66. James Nightingale Commenda, 10 Apr. 1682 Your honours of the 6th of this instant l have received whereby I understand thatmy March accompts are allowed of, but stranges [strange is?J my canoe hyres areagaine termed extravagant, seeing itt is your honours order I should give an accountof what ships comes or passes att this place, which I hope your honour knowes Icannot doc without sending aboard and consequent ly charge itt to an account. Ishall doe my endeavour to purchase what come I can for Mr Shears at the rate of 2angles per chest but the Blacks will not be au the charge of the canoe byre for theinterlopers pays 3 angles per chest now all this present both to windward and lewardof this place. Pray send up the briganteen 48 with the first oppertunity with thosegoods mentioned in my last of the 5th of this instant and Iett the iron barrs be of thebest sort, especially those that are marked. PS. If your honour will lower the price of the red and blew cloath there is aprobabillity to dispose of itt but not att the former rates. 67. James Nightingale no date [May 1682] Yours I have received and shall answer the particulars within this day or two, atpresent am not very well. I have desired all the sheets, Guyney stuffs and bassons, only the 6 pounders and blanketts excepted, from Mr Towgood with a condit ion to pay him in gold att deliver ing according to your rates, but ditto Towgood will not doe it. It is for the cred itt of the fac tory if you order itt, if not patience itt is a sad thing that a factor cannot keepe that respect among the natives as ought to be for the Companys creditt. 68. James Nightingale Commenda, 1 June 1682 Your honours dated the 30th May I have this day received and am certaine your honou r hath done the Royall Company good service in lowering the perpetuanoes I angle per piece and I question not but I sha11 be able to dispose of a good quantity thereof att this place soe soone as the natives knowes our rates. Wherefore I desire your honour will be pleased to send mee upon account of the Royall Company 3 bailes of perpetuanoes, 2 cases or 40 pieces sayes, 10 barrells of powder , alsoe the 29 pieces niccanees for which I have given receipt, and this with the first conven.iency of faire weather.

I would have sent your honour my last two months account but must begg some few dayes delay, I being att present under physick. I am inform'd of two English ships to windward, not knowing whether Companys ships or interlopers. 69.

I designed to have sent up sooner but hath been hithe rto disappointed by the vehement raines which have fa!' n for some dayes and have soe imaged the seas that noe canoes durst hazard off till now. I have by this conveyance alsoe sent up a good man slave for account of the Royall Company for whome I desire a receipt. This faire weather continuing I desire your honour will be pleased to send mee for accoun t of the Royall Company by first conveniency the goods mentioned in my last to your honour of the 1st of this instan t by the which I alsoe desire to know if you migh t be pleased to order the buying of come att 3 angles per chest, whereto I begg your honours answer. If you might be pleased to order the selling the blew pottkeys att 24 per bendy I may dispose of them all this being the rate of the Guyney stuffs which the blacks esteems att equall vallue with the pottkeys. I desire your honour will be pleased to send mee a booke for keep ing my accompts as alsoe two or three quires of paper I haveing but very little or none att all. Here is in this road a small ship bound to the Bite , Evan Leyes Comman der. 70. James Nightinga le Commenda, 24 June 1682 Be pleased to know that I am this day safe arrived here as likewise the 15 handcanoe whereout of I have received 6 pieces sayes, 75 pieces of perpetuano 's, 10barrells of powder, 50 iron barrs and 50 lead barrs and all for account of the RoyallAffrican Company. I desire your honour will be pleased to send mee by the saidcanoe for account of the Royall Company soe many iron barrs marked and of thebest sort as the canoe conveniently can carry, as likewise IOpewter juggs. I wasthis morning aboard the Dutch ships bound for Europe whereof I understand thatthere are two design'd to saile upon Monday next without faile, whereof one forZealand and the other for Amsterdam, but they are absolutely ordered by the Gen.erali of the Mine not to carry any letters for the English nation without his especial!order, but if your honour may be pleased to write under my covert I doubt not butitt shall have a safe conveyance. I have the Commanders promise for the safeconduct of my owne letters. [PS) The St George is now in sight of this place. 71. James Nightingale Commenda, 2 July 1682 Your honours of the 30th June by the 15 hand canoe I have received, as aJsoe 225iron barrs and 10 pewter juggs, for which I shall give the Compan y creditt.

Here isarrived to windward of this place one small Barbarian [sic: = Barbadian] interlopercomeing from the Beneen and St Thoma, I suppose it may be Charles Langley. Thedamaged barrill of powder whereof! writt yesterday was forgott by the canoemenbut shall be sent per first oppertunity. 73. James Nightingale Commenda, 5 July 1682 Last night late I had advice from the Blacks of the arrivall of Captain Henry Nurse who lies now att Succondee. By the Black s relation whoe hath been aboard, hee hath in his ship severall passingers, soe well factors as souldiers. 74. James Nightingale Commenda, 16 July 1682 Your honours dated of the 14th instant I have received whereby I understand my Aprill and May accounts are received and allowed of, but am son-y your honour is displeased with my putting both months into one account, which was occasioned by my being one month at Capo Corsoe in the which time there was little money taken and that which I have sent up was taken after my return e with goods , but in obediencye to your honours commands shall for the future take care to charge every months accounts by itt selfe. I begg your honour would be pleased to send up the 3 bales of perpetuano 's, 40 pieces sayes, IObarrells powder which I writt for last for account of the Royall Company, for these I brought downe last are almost sold and the mony in cash. I aJsoe desire you would be pleased to send mee for account of the Royall Company 500 iron barrs of the best sort and marked for I have still upward of 80 per remaines but cannot put them off because not marked. [PS] Pray send good goods, alsoe a booke to keepe my accounts in per first, want them much. 75. James Nightingale Commenda, 17 July 1682 Your honours of the 15 instant by the 15 hand cano e I have received, as alsoe 250 barrs of iron for which I shall give the Company creditt. According to order per retume of this canoe I send your honour s 10 chests of corne. Charles Langley interloper lies to to windward of this place and is like to make but a bad markett of his Beneen cloaths49 and is in a very weake condition haveing only 5 whitemen aboard. Here is a small interloper from the West Indias, his name unknowne only hee hath served the Company formerly and now intends to settle at Quida.50 The Dutch interloper D Bruyne is alsoe here still. [PS] I have alsoe sent per this canoe one man slave upon the Royall Company account for which I desire a receipt. 76. David Harper Commenda, 2 Aug. 1682 Upon receipt of your honours dated ultimo July I sent for Mr Langley and delivered in his owne hands your honours letter, upon perusall whereof hee declared himselfe happy in being capable to doe your honour any service which hee sayes hee can and will very freely doe in this affaire of Mr Buckham, which I beleeve hee can well doe haveing transported the said Mr Buckham, his wife, children, slaves and estate from the Beneen 51 but complaines that hee dealt verry uncivilly by him after their comeing to St Thoma. I was very urgent with Mr Langley to have him come downe this day butt hee being troubled with a lameness and haveing some business to dispatch aboard humbly beggs your honours pardon for this dayes delay promiseing upon his faith and word to give his personall attendance tomorrow being the 3rd instant att Cabo Corsoc Castle. [PS] Just now is arrived Mr Nightingale but soe ill disposed that hee could not write, yett hath spoke with Mr Langley about this affaire. 77. James Nightingale Comme nda, 4 Aug. 1682 These are to acquaint your honour that since my returne hither I have still been veITy ill disposed as to my health, wherefore begg some few dayes delay before I send up my month ly accompts, hopeing then to be in a better state of body then now and capable to write out my accompts which att present I cannot doe but hope in the mercy of God for a speedy recovery. 78. James Nightinga le Commenda, 14 Aug. 1682 Itt haveing pleased God after a veITy sore fitt of sickness to put mee in some way of recovery, although as yett I continue very weake and my health returns but slowly yett, I have endeavoured to draw up the last months accompt which I send your honour herein inclosed by this express of my boatswaine, as alsoe the ballance of the same to Mr Henry Spurvay being 4 marks, 7 ounces , 10 angles, 10 tacco's . Satureday night last came in this road Captain Andrews, Captain May and Captain Morphy, interlopers , they provided with all sorts of currant goods and takes a great deale of money and I to the contrary take not one cracra on shoare in the Companys factory. 79. James Nightingale Commenda , 17 Aug. 1682 Your honours of the 15th instant I have received. As to Agamaco's being sent to Aguaffo I wish itt may tend to the Companys profitt for truely, although I have hitherto consealed what I could of the knavery of these people of Little Commenda upon expectation of their amendment, but finding them dayly to be worse and worse I am now forced to acquaint your honour that the Royall Companys interest in this place is very much abused for they now openly doe what they please in laying out their mony in all ships and I can sell nothing here but what I must trust for 2 or 3 months before I can gett my money and they only looke upon us here as pledges for their security that noe harme may come to them aboard ship. And they not only refraine buying the Companys goods but now attempts the stealing thereof, as I have severall times found by the chalks wherewith the iron barrs were marked and after counting the same in presence of Captain Brackon and the Kings Mareen have found 48 barrs wanting soe that except other meanes be used soe well for advance .ing the trade as secureing the Companys goods I shall grow scrupilous to take any longer charge of the Companys concerns here, feareing they may begin their old tricks in breaking open the warehouse and takeing the goods from thence. The bad money returned I have received and by this bearer have sent Mr Spurvay good money in leiu thereof, itt is my greate loss but occasioned by my sickness being unable to looke after itt my selfe. 80. James Nightingale Commenda, 19 Aug. 1682 After humbly begging your honours serious consideration of my last dated the 17th instant, these serves to acquaint your honour that last night about 9 of the clock there happened here some few houses to windward of the Royall Companys factory a most terrible and vehement fire which in the space of one halfe houre consumed above 60 houses but by tl1e providence of God in calming the wind and our great industry in dethatching all the houses betwixt us and the fue which threatned any damage to our quarter [we] have, blessed be God, preserved the Royall Companys concerns from any damage of those threatning flames. The three interlopers are still in the roade coming and tradeing. 81. James Nightinga le Commenda, 24 Aug. 1682 Your honours two letters of the 18th and 22nd instant I have received and according to order shall. continue a good and faire correspondence with these people, the which hitherto I have done to my expences, although frustrate of my designe in advanceing the Royall Companys trade and interest, which they dayly more and more contemne by bringing all their goods from aboard ship and I have not taken one cracra since my last comeing from Cabo Corsoe and the money sent up last was for goods trusted out two months before and I truly beleeve soe long as there is a ship on this side Axim that they will buy none of the Companys goods, but I shall trust to your honours writting for redress of these wrongs by the first of the vessells that comes from leward . Whereas the King of Aguaffo's presence [pre.tence?] for conniveing with and assisting the rogues of Little Commenda in theirvillainy's only is my not duely paying his customes this I can prove to be a falseuntruth by Captain Brackon and the Mareen, whoe have received the customs offmy hands and carryed them up to him att the time agreed upon by contract. TheFeteras52 custome I had hitherto detained upon account of the two slaves, but since the receipt of your Honours letter have sent him one peece of perpetuanoe with halfan ancho r of brandy, soe that they are wholly paid one years custome. 82. James Nightingale Commenda, l Sept. 1682 Your honour s ultimo August I have received whereby I understand your honours order for removeing the Royall Companys factory from this place which shall inall points to the uttmoslof my power punctuallybe obeyed soe soone as thebriganteen is arrived here. The people here are soe refractory against our remov ingthat they will give noe assistance in carrying the goods to the waterside, thereforedesire your honour will be pleased to send up one of the big canoes with 5 or 6slaves for carrying the goods to the waterside, otherw ise itt will be impossible togett the iron barrs off. Your honour has not been pleased to mention anything in theletter about David Harper or the flagg. If my small advice might be accepted I think itt fitt that the flagg may be left for the keeping the Royall Companys possession and that David Harper may come up with the goods, itt being impossible for awhiteman to stay here after the factory's removeall, but desire your honours answertherein which in this and all other things shall be obeyed. I desire your honourwould send one of your Cabosheers whoc may see the removal and take notice ofwhat pallavora either transactions may be occasioned by the natives soe well thatyour honour may understand rightly all the business. I desire a speedy answer. 83. James Nightinga le Commenda, 8 Sept. 1682 Your honours of the 2d instant by Cabosheire Aggamaco with the 5 hand canoe, asalsoe one of this instant by Docter Griffins boy I have received. The reason Tdid not answer your Honours by Aggamaco before now was my dayly expecti ng MrTowgoods arrival! here and soe after speedy imbarquing of the Royall Companysconcerns att this factory in person Lo have given your honour a true and realeaccount of all affaires att this place. This accompa ny's Aggarnaco whoe I have sentup by a 2 hand canoe to give your honour a full relation of what hath past here since his comeing to Commenda, and truly I have peremptoryly obeyed your orders inkeeping a good correspond ence with the natives, soe that there is noe pallavora herenor anything to be pretended in prejudice of the Royall Company's interest or my own person, soe that I doubt not, the ship once arrived, but with creditt to my masters the Royall Affrican Company of England to bring of all the concerns alt this factory, which in this and all others shall be obeyed by [James Nightingale]. PS. I heare noe news from the windward; Pray dispatch Aggamaco against the sh ips arrivall. 84. James Nightingale Commenda, IO Sept. 1682 Your honours of the 9th instant I have received and am sorry you are pleased to tenne my Jetter frivilous, itt being soe full an answer to your honour s of the 8th instant as I att that time could give. Whereas your honour takes itt ill my putting the Royall Company to the charge of the 2 hand canoe, my intention therein was for the best, for understanding your Honour was soe earnest to know how all affaires stood here I thought itt fitt besides my writting to send up Aggamaco whoe might give your honour a persona II accompt how affai res stood here as to the Royall Companys concerns. Last night came here the Kings man desireing Captain Bracon and mee up to Aguaffoe that hee might understand the reason of our remove ing but I sent word that my business here was to looke after my masters concerns and if hee had any thing to say to the Royall Affrican Company that hee must have his recourse to Cabo Corsoe. I have formerly writt your honour my opinion about leaveing the fllagg for keeping the Royall Companys possession, concerning which I desire your pleasure as alsoe your honours order for bringing up David Harper, for as yett I have received noe particular order concerning either of them. To the 5 hand canoemen I have paid cank/ 3 money hitherto, I desire to know if your honour will allow of the continuance thereof while they are here. I desire your honour to send mee for accompt of the Royall Affrican Compa ny IOgaJlons of brandy. I have sent a case to putt ill in and will be att the charge of canoe hyre myselfe. There is an interloper to windward att Dickiscove. ***** 85. David Harper Commenda, 10 Jan. 1682/3 Immediatly after my arrivall here with Docter Griffin wee sent up your honours dasheys to the King and Feuera, and have alsoe disposed of the other two cases and anchor of brandy to the Cappusheers and merchants of Commenda, for which they all render your honour hearty thanks, as alsoe for your honours care in preserving the English's interest in this place. The Cappusheers promise with all care and speed to goe about building the Royall Company's factory. The Dutch have herethree whitemen besides the Cheife, and have been very large both in their brandyand customes , as Griffin can give your honour an account, which is the reason thepeople are somewhat urgent for their customes according to contract. Att settlingCaptain Bracon desires your honour would send up by his owne canoe 25 blew and15 green perpettuanoes for account of the Royall Company and alt the months endmoneyes shal I be sent downe for the goods that may be disposed of with an accountof the remaines soe well of the goods formerly brough t up by himselfe as of whatmay be consign'd to this place for the future. 86. David Harper Cornmenda, 16 Jan. 1682/3 , Your Honours of the 11th instant with the 40 pieces perpetuano's and brandyconsigned to Captain Bracon came safe to hand. These may acquaint your honourthat the Cabbisheers are very eager to goe about the building and have been twodayes att worke in breaking of earth for the worke , but they declare themselvesunable to goe about the walls without the assistance of some better workeman thanany att this place, which I understand by Captain Bracon to be the truth for althoughhee bath soe many slaves of his owne yett the building his house cost him one bendyto an Fanteener who he brought from Fanteen to direct and oversee his worke, wherefore if your honour be pleased that this building be brought to any perfectionbefore the raines itt will be verry fitt that two or three men that have knowledge inbuilding be provided and sent up with speed. The Fanteeners are said to be the bestworkemen, whereof there lives one with Captain Cooffy whoe knows his businessverry well and may serve your honour in this affaire.The Dutch Copeman is very busie in provideing for his building, hee hath gotta sloopes loading of timber from Shuma and hath here a carpenter a makeing ofdoors and windows. Hee expects to have his house up in six weeks for hee is tohave 20 slaves from the Mina , hee will make his house two storyes high with onlyfoure large roomes, two below and two above, the whole length 59 foot and 18 footbroad, the walls two foot thick. The goods the Dutch have here are sayes, iron barr sand perpetuano's which hee sells at 9a per piece, brandy, and Beneen cloaths. TheCopeman tells mee hee bath found but small trade since his comeing, which heedoes not much notice soe long as there are noe goods att the Mina to supply himwith but soe soone as supplyes come, which are dayly expected by foure ships fromEurope, hee expects to have a considerable trade though little to his masters profitt for hee says that by his brothers54 order hee will undersell all ships that comes inthe road , they selling soe cheape as they will. The trade is but little att present,which is d1e reason that the boysado's and perpettuanoe s remaine unsold, but Captain Bracon desires mee to acquaint your honour that there is some probabillity in selling the perpettuanoes as likewise a considerable quantity more before any ships come downe to hinder the trade, for he sayes that soe long as your honour will sell the RoyaJJ Companys goods att the same rates the Dutch does that they shall have but little trade in such goods as your Honour consignes to this place, which truely I verryly beleeve hee haveing the whole trade of the place in his hands. Upon Fryday last there was 4 interlopers in this roade, their names I can give your honour noe accoount of for the Blacks could only tell mee that they were Engli sh ships and interlopers, they are all goo to leward, soe that the roade is att present altogether without shipping though I doe not know how long for I am informed that Captain How with two more are to windward. I have alsoe had notice by a canoe that came from windward that upon Sunday last Captain Shears had gott no higher then Cape Trespointas. Commenda, 19 Jan. 1682/387. David Harper Your honours of the 17th instant I have rece ived. In answer as to the building the factory [I] must acquaint your Honour that except people expert in building be sent up the worke will never be accomplished, for the people here will know noe pathem nor draught, but will make a house to their owne minds, which I see by their cutting of the haJfe from the first draught, and what they build the walls does not exceed one foot thickness which I told them was but laboure in vaine, whereto they an.swered that if your honour sent up any here there should be noe want of earth to build with, but for themselves they know not to manage soe greate a worke as the draught of that factory is. As to account of goods consigned to Captain Bracon be pleased to know that the 6 chests of sheets are only sold, which hee saies hee bought of your honour att 4a per chest, which comes to in all Mk 3, the which sume of 3 markes hee hath sent your honour per the bearer in good gold for account of the Royall Company desire.ing a receipt for the same. The boysadoes and perpetuanoes remaine entire and not sold, neither can hee put off the perpettuanoes att IOa per piece, but saith if your honour will consider that this is the place where all goods are sold cheaper then to leward and abate l angle upon the perpettuanoes hee can immediatly dispose of what are here and doe the Company service in disposing of a considerable quantity more in a short time. Hee also desires your Honour to abate him I peaze upon each chest of sheets, if granted hee desires lO chests may be sent up for account of the Royall Company. The marchants do not denie the payment of one piece of sletia and halfe an anchor of brandy, to which I myselfe was wittness at Mr Nightingals settleing, but they demand itt againe as due once a yeare. 88. David Harper Commenda, 24 Jan. 1682/3 This weeke merch ants being come downe Captain Bracon hath disposed of 36pieces of the Royall Companys perpettuanoes att IOangles per piece, the 4 piecesremaining being a little damaged will not goe off here. The 36 pieces perpclluanoessold au 10a per piece amoun ts to 2 marks, 6 ounces, 8 angles , which I have sentyour Honour in good gold for account of the Royall Company, alsoe 6 angles morethat Captain Bracon was owing upon account of the sheets, amounting in al] to 2marks, 6 ounces and 14 angles, for which 1 desire a receipt. Soe there remaines attpresent in the hands of Captain Bracon only the 8 pieces boysado 's, and if yourhonou r will soe order itt the 4 pieces perpeuuanoes sha ll be return'd to Cabo Corsoeper first conveniency. Captain Bracon desires your honour will be pleased to sendup per first oppertunity for account of the Royall Company IOchests of sheets, with30 blew and 30 green perpetuano's, which if sent up with speed will undoubtablyhave some vent, there being noe ships here att present. Bracon desires to acquaintyour honour that hee is a looser in 5 angles which hee paid for canoe hyre forbringing up the last sheets, but hopes your honour wi ll prevent the same for thefuture by sending the goods up in the Royall Companys canoes, alsoe by encour.aging him according 10 desert for what serv ice he may doe the Royall Company allthis place, especially now when the Dutch are labouring soe much to gett him totheir side but I hope shall not prcvaile. I humbly begg your honour might be pleasedto allow some brandy to be spent, for the people does expect itt where the Companygoods are sold. In this and what else does conceme myselfe I trust wholy to yourhonours good ness and pleasure. Since the receipt of your hon ours last letter I havehad two meeting with the Cabosheers of Commenda about the building of theCompanys factory and they absolutely declare themselves uncapable to undertakethe worke with fewer then three workmen from Cabo Corsoe for building the walJs,which if complyed with itt will be necessary they be sent up with spcede soe theraines may not againc prevent the worke 89. David Harper Commenda, 26 Jan. 1682/3 Your honours of the 25th instant I have received, alsoe the 60 pieces perpctuano'sand 10 chests of sheets consigned to Captain Bracon are come safe to hand. Hereare att present severall merchants from the country, soe Bracon expects that theperpetuano's this day received may be disposed of by tomorrow night. WhereforeCaptain Bracon desires your honour would be pleased to send him with all possiblespeede for account of the Royall Company I00 pieces green and blew perpctuano 's,40 pieces sayes, and 10 barrells powder. These goods Captain Bracon des ires to behere against tomorrow night or Sunday morning all farthest, for the merchants arein great hast to be gon againe to the country. I humbly thank your hon our in thatyou have been pleased to allow us here 6 gallons brandy per month to be spent upon the Royall Company's accompt, I have sent per this canoe one empty anchor containing 6 gallons which I hope your honour will cause to be filled and sent up for accornpt of the ensueing month. Paper, pen and inke is very scarce with mee, which I hope your Honour will be pleased to supply. I desire the prizes of the sayes and powder. 90. David Harper Commenda , 28 Jan. 1682/3 Your honours of the 27th instant I have received. The 100 pieces perpetuano's and 40 pieces sayes, with the 6 gallons brandy for the factory's use are all come safe to Captain Bracons hands. I have sent you per bearer for account of the Royall Com .pany 4 marks, 5 ounces, and 8 angles, which is the just sume of the 60 perpettuanoes last received amounts to. The perpetuanoes this day received will immediatly be sold, wherefore Captain Bracon desires your honour would be pleased to send him more for account of the Royall Company I00 pieces blew and green perpetuano 's with the 10 barrells powder last writt for with its price. Hee desires likewise if ill may please your Honour to Jett him have 50 pieces of the now writt for per.petuanocs at 9a per piece, which hee intends to send up in the cou ntry upon his own account soe that bee may gell some profilt by them for himselfe. I see but little probabillity for building the factory this season, for the blacks sayes plainely they will not undertake such a building except your honour send people up to build ill, as alsoe the raines will goe neare to be a greate hinderance to itt. Captain Bracon humbly desires you would cause Oliver the blacksmith to make him a grapline of two iron barrs for a 9 hand canoe, the barrs hee desire s may be placed to his account. 91. David Harper Commenda, 30 Jan. 1682/3 Your honours of the 29th instant I have received. The 100 pieces of perpet uano's and 10 barrells powder consigned to Captain Bracon hee hath alsoe received. I would according to your honours commands have sent an account of the goods received, sold and remaines thereof per this convenie ncy but am resolved about the last of the weeke to come downe myselfe to Caho Corsoe, to know your Honour s mind about building the factory in some particulars , att which time I shall satisfie your honour as to that account and bring with mee what gold Captain Bracon hath gott in cash. 92. David Harper Commenda , 8 Feb. I 682/3 Your honours of the 7th instant I have received, in answer whereof your honour may be pleased to know that I can by noe meanes perswade Captain Bracon to come downe to Cabo Corsoe at this time, his reasons are the great pallavoras that are up in the country att present, and that hee will not stir abroad before hee heares the effec1s thereof. Likewise hee complaines that hee cannot goe abroad without agreate charge in expences, as hee found by experience when hee was last at Cabo Corsoe. As to the particulars of agreeing with Bracon about commission of goodssold by him hee demands I peaze per marke soe well for the goods already sold as that may be sold for the future; I begg a line in answer whereby I may give him anaccount if your Worship does comply with his demands, alsoe if .what you arepleased to allow him shall be deteyned here in his owne hands or sent up from CaboCorsoe upon receipt of what moneys he sends downe. I have herewith sent your honour the Tanton Querrey account55 which those people acknowledged to beowing in presence of the Quarrant eer56 and Captain Peeter. There is noe trade attpresent by reason of those outfallings in Abraboe,57 however Captain Bracon hath some mony in cash which hee hath taken for sheets and shall send itt downe pernext. Mr Towgood finds alsoe but small trade here.58As to account of shiping hereor to windward I referr itt to Captain Shears. 93. David Harper Commenda, 12 Feb. 1682/3 Your honours of the 8th instant by Docter Griffin I have received. As to the palavorawith Abracon hee doe faithfully promise to advance the Royall Companys tradeand maintaine their interest in this place. As to the commission money CaptainBracon stood hard upon 3 angles but by much perswasions have brought him toexcept of2 angles per marke, which hee expects your honour will be pleas'd to sendhim from Cabo Corsoe for all the money that hath been taken since the goods werefirst consign'd to him and soe once a month for the future. Bracon hath sent downeby Docter Griffin 5 marks, IO angles of good gold for account of the RoyallCompany, which payes for the JOchests of sheets last sent up; Hee desires yourhonour would send him more for account of the Royall Company 10 chests ofsheets with I anchor of brandy for this months allowance with one halfe anchorwhich Docter Griffin borrowed of him. The trade is but bad at present. Last night came in this roade a small ship with Companys jack and pendant but I have under.stood that hee is an interloper bound to the Bite. 94. David Harper Commenda, 16 Feb. 1682/3 Your honours of the 14th instant with the brandy therein mentioned I have received.I am sorry your honour can spare Abracon noe more sheets, for the goods that arehere yeilds noe money att present, they being soe much undersold aboard by Captain Price and Boles whoe sells their say es att 13 and perpettuanoes att 9 angles per piece. Yesterday morning Captain Bracon with the rest of the merchants of this place went up to Aguaffoe being sitted [= cited] by the King upon account of a pallavora caused by the Arcanies of Little Commenda, whoe are alsoe there and threaten to leave the country because the merchants here will not suffer them to goe aboard and buy their goods themselves. It is said that the Dutch have complained of the small trade hee finds here, alsoe that the merchants slights his goods and have bought the Royall Companys goods out of Abracons hands, likewise [they com.plained] against them goeing aboard. What effects these pallavoras will take I can give your honour noe account before Captain Bracons return. Last night came in this road a small interloper whose Commander Bennitt dyed att Cape Trespointas , shee is now commanded by one Rolands who was Docter and part owner. 95. David Harper Commenda, 23 Feb. 1682/3 This goes by Captain Bracons canoe by whome hee hath sent I marke, 4 ounces, 3 angles, good gold, for which hee desires your honour would please to send him 3 chests of sheets. Captain Bracon with the rest of the merchants of this place re.turned from Aguaffoe upon Wednesday ni!ght, by whome I understand the King hath given free leave to the three Cheife of the Arcanies to goe aboard ship and trade, which is a great signe of the little regard the King carry's to the factory's that are kept here. The Dutch Copeman hath left off his building a mud house and is now dayly with the King to suffer him to build a stone house, how his desire will be complyed with I know not, but am of opinion that hee shall hardly gett a house to live in this raines. Tradeing is soe dead that Bracon cannot put off any of the Royall Companys goods at present. There is noe news of any shiping to windward. Captain Price and Boles are still in this roade. 96. David Harper Commenda, 24 Feb. 1682/3 Your honours two severall letters of the 23rd instant I have received. The 3 chests of sheets Captain Bracon hath received, acknowledging himselfe greatly bound to your honours favour in letting him have them att the former price, the which favour hee promised to recompence in his fidility in the Royall Company's concerns. As to a further account of the palavora att Aguaffoe be pleased to know that the Arcanies complaints have been very great against the people of Little Commenda, especially for pulling up their fittishes and throwing them in the sea, for which act the King hath prendeed the Commenda Cabosheers in 2 bendy's of gold. Captain Bracon was hard against their goeing aboard, alsoe Aban from the Mina told the King itt was the Generalls desire that none of the Arcanies should be tollerate to goe aboard, notwithstanding all this hee has given free leave to the three Cheife of the Arcany's to trade aboard ship. The Arcanies are all to retume hither tomorrow. The Dutch is verry busie pulling downe all his former worke , for a little money gott leave of the I(jng to build a stone house, which hee intends to goe about with all expedition. 97. David Harper Commenda, 2 March 1682/3 Your Honours of the 26th February I have received and have made all possible enquirey after the sorts and quantities of goods brought over by the Dutch Company ship last arrived , yett can attain noe possitive account of the same, only the goods that are come are currant goods, but in quantity far short of expectation , the whole cargoe not exceeding 5000 prime cost. The two ships that went downe yesterday are expected to have better cargoes then the first, the Copeman here received yesterday a fresh supply of sheets , sayes and perpettuanoes. Captain Bracon desires to acquaint your Honour that tradeing is soe very dead at this place that there is not the least enquirey made after the RoyaJI Company goods now in his hands, but if your Honour will Jett him have sheets at the former price of 32 per benda he desires 10 or I 2 chests may be sent up by the first conveyance, not doubting but they may goe off by degrees in the intrime that other goods lyes dead. 98. David Harper Commenda, 2 [var.22] March 1682/3 Your Honours of the 1st instant I have received, and have acquainted Captain Bracon, with the great supply of all sorts of goods brought to Cabo Corso by the Royall Company ship last arrived, of which goods he knows noJ11e to be a comodity here at present, only sheets excepted, which if your Honour will Jett him have att 32 per benda as formerly, he will endeavour to dipose of 10 or 12 chests if sent up per the first conveyance, but at 28 per benda he will take none, the Dutch selling them also at the same rate of 32. Bracon desires to know how the broad and narrow niccanees and tapseels are sold in the Castle, and ifhe likes of their prices will take some quantity of each sort. Since the sheets have been sold Bracon hath not taken one benda of gold for any of the Royall Companys goods that are in his hands, which proceeds from the deadness of trade, as also being dayly undersold by interlopers whoe sells their sayes att 12 and perpettuanoes att 08a each. Here is noe news of any ships to windward. 99. David Harper Commenda, 5 March 1682/3 Your Honours of the 3rd instant I have received and have perused Captain Bracons account, which I find cleare and without mistake or error. The mony sent to Capo Corso by him comes in all Mk 23 3o 8a and just pa yes for the goods sold vizt I 040 sheets at 32 per benda and 196 perpettuanoes att I Oa per peice. The goods remayn.ing unsold are 104 perpettuanoes, 40 pieces sayes, 10 barrells powder and 8 pieces boysadoes. Captain Bracon desires your Honour will send him for account of the Royall Company 6 chests of sheets and 170 4 pound basons with their prices as they are sold in the Castle. Here waits a merchant for the basons therefore they are desired with hast. Bracon also desires the monthly allowance of brandy may be sent up, for which he hath sent a casque containing 6 gallons. I am informed by the merchants that sayes begins to goe well of in the country. Perpettuanoes are like to be noe such comodity as formerly. This morning Captain Boles departed this road. There is noe news of any shipping to windward. 100. David Harper Commenda, 7 March 1682/3 Your Honours of the 6th instant I have received. The 6 chests of sheets and 199 [ var. 169] 41b basons with 6 gallons brandy factoryes use consigned to Captain Bracon he hath also received. I have acquainted Captain Bracon with your desire, and if the boysadoes and other goods [stay?] in his hands, whereto he answer s that it is his none of his fault that merchants doe not buy the goods of him , also that the road hath not been cleare of shipping in a long time till now, whoe have very much undersold the Companys prices, but he desires your Honours patience till the end of this month , and if the boysadoes doe not goe off before, that he will pay for them himselfe and also give your Honour his advice what hopes may be for disposing of the rest of the goods, for he sayes the Dutch and blacks will looke upon as a great affront put upon him to withdraw the goods soe long as he thinkes himselfe capable to make them good upon all accounts and also to put them of when oppertunity offers. Bracon desires the prices of the narrow niccanees and tapseels, and if likes of their prices he thinkes they may yeald present mony. 101. David Harper Cornmenda, 9 March 1682/3 By this express Captain Bracon hath sent downe for account of the Royall Com .pany 3 marks 2 ounces good gold, whereof 1 marke 3 ounces pa yes for the 8 pieces of boysadoes , and 1 marke 7 ounces for the l 0 barrells of powder, the boysadoes he hath paid with his owne mony. Bracon desires your Honour would please to send him for account of the Royall Company and with the first conveyance 12 barrells of powder, the halfe of the powder is desired in halfe barre Us, also the prices of the narrow niccanees and tapseels as formerly desired. [PS] Bracon desires your Honour would send him on account of the Royall Com .pany a paire of scales and weights, for he finds himselfe a looser by his takeing mony on his small scales and weights. 59 102. David Harper Commenda, l l March 1682/3 Your Honours of the 10th instant with 12 barrells powder consigned to CaptainBracon are well received. I have also received a line from Mr Spurvay complainingof the scarceness of the weight of the money sent downe, which Bracon takes to bevery strange since there is not a parcell of mony sent downe but he puts 2 anglesupon it to make it the better weight at Capo Corso, wherefore he desires yourHonour againe to send him up a poyle60 of scales and weights whereby he may both take and pay his mony. Otherwise he sayes his comission will not make the differ.ence of the weight of the mony good betwixt what he receives and payes. The goodsin the Dutch factory before the arrivall of the last ship where[= were) iron barrs,Bencen clouts, a few perpettuanoes and brandy, since he hath received 7 cases ofsaycs, 2 bales of perpettuanoes, 5 cases of fine sletias, 6 chests of sheets, 2 chestsof carabin cs and firelocks with 4 halfe chests of beads, whereof he hath sold a goodquantity of sayes (which is the reason those of the Royall Company goes of soeslowly, the blacks having alwaycs a better opinion of the Dutch then English sayes).He hath also sold all his carbin es and firelocks, with most of his beads, the rest ofthe goods doe not goe off but arc like to lye upon his hands. Upon Fryday last camehere Abraham [sic:= Aban) of the Mina in his retumc from Abramboe when he hadmade an end of all palaveras, he had a palavcra with the people of Little Commendawherein he desired their care of the Generalls brother61 with an advancing of histrade. Since the writing of the above is the Dutch Copeman gone lo the Mina beingwritten by an express from his brother. 103. David Harper Comenda, 18 March [1682/3] Your Honours of the 16th instan t with the box of scales and 4 ounces poyle ofweights I have received. I have acquainted Captain Bracon with your Honoursorder for selling the sayes att 15 angles each, which he sayes will give the merchants more encouragement to buy the Royall Company goods. Upon Thursday last cameto this road Captain Haywood from London, interloper, he reports that some 12dayes agoc upon his departur e from Abbeny that Captain Rickards arrived there.The Dutch fiscall went yesterday to windward, there being one of their Companysships arrived at Axime. Last night the Dutch Copeman received an express from the Genera II orderin ghim to resigne his warehouse to his second and to repaire with al Ihis own concemesto the Mina, in order to his goeing Copema n to Accra, the ship Affrica at the Minawaiting only for his transportation theithcr.62 104. David Harp er Comenda, 27 March 1683 Your Honours of the 26th instant I have rece ived. The reason of my not writ ing till now was I under stood your Honour had advice of the Royall Companys ships being in this road, also there being noe trade on shourc since the ships arrivall soe there affords nothing elce worth the advising. Captain Low is stil l here and hath sent his pinke to windward with what goods he knew might be most vendible, he intends to fall downe to Capo Corso tomorrow. Captain Bracon hath betwixt 5 and 6 marks in cash, which he promises (after he hath made up his accounts) to send downe on Fryday or Saterday without failc. As to what goods may vend best here, can give your Honou r noe certaine account till the merchanlS have disposed the goods they have upon hand from aboard ship, but afterwards shall not faile to acquaint your Honour what goods are most des ired. [PS] Captain Bracon sayes the narrow nicca ness will yea ld noe more then 3 angles here and narrow tapseels 4 angles per piece, at which prices if your Honour will send up 100 pieces of each he will endeavour to dispose of them. 105. David Harper Comenda, 30 March 1683 By this express Captain Bracon hath sent your Honour for account of the Royall Company 6 marks, 8 angles good gold. The goods sold are as followeth vizt J69 41b pewter basons att 2a per piece M 2: 5: 2 J95 sheets att 28 per benda l: 5: 14 4 barrells powder an 1o 8a per barrell 0:6:0 8 pieces sayes att 15a per peice 0:7:8 Mk 6: 0: 8 Captain Bracon desires your Honour might please to send him per bearer his comission mony for what mony he hath heitherto sent downe, which comes in all 32 marks 6 ounce s, soe that his comission mony that is due to him at 2a per marke comes to 4 ounces, l angle and 6 taccoes. The Kfog and Fetera, also the old and young Cappusheers63 of Little Comrnenda doe demand their custome s as due at puttin g the come in the ground. Capta in Bracon is very earn est it may be paid them , for he sayes if their brandy which is due be paid at this time they will not expect their other customes before the dancing times. There is now due in brandy to the King and Fetera each 1 anchor and to the old and young Cappusheer s each l halfe anchor, in all 3 anchors. I desire if it might please your Honour to send up the brandy with the 6 gallons for next months factori es use in a quarter casq ue and the caske shaJI be return'd by the canoe that brings it up, for I could gett noe anchors to send downe. The Kings man waites here for his portion of it. lfyour Honour will Jett Bracon have the narrow niccanees and tapseels the one at 3a and the other att4a per piece he desires 100 pieces of each may be sent up. There lyes one Por.tugueze ship at Tacarada loaden wit h Brazeele tobaco , suger and rum, he hath agood markett for his tobaco and sells it at 4 lb per angle to the blacks. 64 There is also two English interlopers at Dickecove. 106. David Harper Commenda, 6 Apr. 1683 Your Honours of the 30th March I have received and have acquain ted Captai nBraco n with the bad we ight of the money sent last downe, which seemes strangeto him, however is well satisfied that the Royall Company is paid out of his com.mission money and renders your Honou r hearty thanks for the remainder whichhec hath received being 3 ounc es, lO angles, 7. tacco's, which payes him for allthe money hitherto sent to Cabo Corsoe by him. Bracon desires the grapling whichyour honou r ordered to be made for him may besent up for hee much wants itt andhath sent this canoe express for the same. l have sent downe 2 empty anchorsdesireing itt may please your Honour to order the brandy for the old and youngCabas heers customes and the 6 gallon's factory's allowance to be sem up in thesame by this conveyance. Here is in this roade Captain Summerv ill interloper, alsoethe Portuguze. Tradeing is verry dead and but little money a stirring either ashoareor aboard. I humbly beg itt may please your honour to order the sending up mysallary now due per beare r for I verry much want itt, haveing been here the 8th ofthis instant 3 full yearly months, alsoe humbly entreating your Honour wouldconsider that my liveing is farr more chargeable then an Cabo Corsoe and accord.ingly to grant some advancement of sallary, but in this as in all others 1 wholly trustto your honours goodness and pleasure. 107. David Harper Commenda, 12 Apr. 1683 Your Honours of the 11th instant with Abracons grapline and the 12gallons brandy are well received. In answer to your honour s concerning the trade here and shipping to windward be pleased to know that here hath been here no country merchants in3 weeks either Arcanys or Quiffers soe that there arc noe goods sold and all thingsverry dead as to tradeing. Yesterday came in the road Captain Thompson interloper,hee hath a verry great Gold Coast cargoe but hitherto hath had but a bad trade. Heereports that Captain Pearson is to windward and may be expected here in a few dayes, bee hath a great ship of 46 guns and a cargoe of 12,000 pounds. There arealsoe three Dunkerkers to windward of 20 or 24 guns apeece. I 08. David Harper Commenda, 18 Apr. 1683 Captain Bracon desires if ill may please your honour to send him for account of the Royall Affrican Company 10 chests sheets, for the 3 chests last remayni ng are sold and greater pro babillity for selling some sheets then any other commodyty att this present dead time. Captain Sommcvill is still in this roade and takes but verry little money's. There are two Dutch interlopers awatering att Cape Trespunctas. ltt is reported alsoe that there is an English ship att Axim but uncertain whether Com.panys ship or interloper. 109. David Harper Commenda , 21 Apr. 1683 Your honours of the 18th instant I have received. The 10 chests sheets consign'd to Captain Bracon hee also received from aboard the sloope.65 Abracon hath sent your honour by Mr Towgood for accompt of the Royall Company 2 marks, 5 ounces, 6 angles J0. tacco's in good gold , the goods sold are these vizt 3 chests sheets containing I 95 pieces au 28 per bendy, Im 5o 14a JOV2ta;12 peeces perpettuano's au tOa per piece --:7:8:-[making) 2: 5: 6: 10.. The reason why sayes and perpetluanoe s lyes here upon hand is because there comes noe merrchants neither Arcany's nor any other to buy them and I doubt not but your Honour verry well knowes that is the cheife cause that tradeing is soe dead alongst the whole coast. 110. David Harper Commcnda, 26 Apr. 1683 Upon Monday last the slaves of this place being according to custome gon for water, news was brought that they were panyard by one of the IGngs couzens whoe lives neareby, whereupon the Cabosheers went out to know the matter but found only the Arcany slaves carried away, whereupon they sent for this person but [he] refuseing to come in, some ann 'd men went out and tooke him and sett his croome66 on fire, alsoe wounded scverall of his men whereof 2 freemen are dead. Upon this wrong the friends of this Kings couzen whoe are many and strong in Aguaffoe threatens to come down and be reveng'd of Commenda by settin g itt on fire. The King for makeing up the pallavora hath sent for the Cabosheers and Arcany's, whoe went up last night, and Abracon is now departed thither whose desire is for the more security of the Royall Company's concerns that your honour would upon receipt hereof send a Cabasheer with the Companys caine to the King of Aguaffoe warning him that hee take great care noe harmc be don to Little Commenda, but especially to the house of Captain Abracon, where now there is such a considerable quantity of the Royall Companys conce rns, as also to dispatch Captain Beacon with hast to looke after the same in such a troublesome time, alsoe if the Royall Company sustaine any damage that ill will lye upon his head to make itt good according tocontract. This in great hast. 111. David Harper Commenda, 5 May 1683 Last night one of Aguaffoe Cabosheers with his souldiers being here, some of his people having taken a corrall necklace from Captain Coffee's boy our peoplereprehended him therefore, whereupon hee immediately discharg'd some shott and threatened to ki IIand plunder all, soe that Bracon put his men in armes but ere theywere gott ready the rogue comes againe and fires a great many shott into CaptainBracons court, there stood amongst the rest of the people, soe that a great many were wounded whereof my boy the boatswaine was one, whoe I have sent downeby the canoe hopeing your honour will order his wounds to be cured, but afterBracons people were gott ready they fought a long time ere our people gott themdriven out of the towne. Some hours afterwards our people went out and fought himagaine soe that bee fled. There is 6 of our people kill'd and a great many wounded. How itt will goe still is uncertaine, there being noe people come from the King asyett. The Mareens croome is all burnt off. I shall waite your honours orders in thissad distress, for neither the Companys goods nor our lives are safe att present. TheGenerali of the Mina hath sent up Aban with some great canoes and Caboshee rs here to looke after his factory, but hath as yett given noe orders to withdraw. Your honours immediat commands are expected. 112. David Harper Commenda, 8 May 1683 Your honours of the 6th instant with the 9 and 3 hand canoes and boyes arrived here yesterday morning, and according to order (the Dutch haveing first removed all their concerns and Whitemen ) [I] have shipt aboard the 9 hand canoe 79 per.petuano's, 17 pieces of sayes, and 4 barrells powder, which are the remaines of theRoyall Company's concerns att Commenda factory. After the dispatch of the 9 bandcanoe I went two severaU times to the waterside with Captain Bracon thinking tohave brought him with mee to Cabo Corsoe, but the Kings people would not sufferus to goe off, for they come downe hourly promiseing that this day people shallcome to make pallavora's with him and give him all desired satisfaction for his staying and the factory's being continued, whereupon Captain Bracon hath per.swaded mee to waite for your honours answer of this one letter, wherein I desire your honours express order if I shall immediatly come downe to Cabo Corsoe, leaving Abracon here, or if I shall stay longer to heare the pallavora's, and if in caseBracon getts satisfaction soe that bee stayes if I shall put up the flagg againe andcontinue, for I find Bracon inclines to staying, although I doe what I can to per.swade him itt will be better to make his pallavora 's at Cabo Corsoe then here, butbee tells mee that if bee leave the place the Cabosheers of Aguaffoe will turne the King out, seeing the trouble came by one of his couzens. If your Honour incline s to keepe the place itt will not be amiss to send up to Aguaffoe desireing gold pawnes for the future security of the Royall Companys factory and Bracon s person , or eke such men pawnes as shall be approven of by Captain Bracon, likewise to deliver Akasy in Bracons hands (for wee understand that the King of Fetue hath offered to deliver him for a little money),67 alsoe to turne his couzen Taggee68 out of the country. These are the conditions Bracon desires, otherwayes hee will leave the place, all the best of his things being gon and the great canoe lying here ready with the rest, for hee bath not left a doore nor window in his house. The goods for which Bracon remaines debter are IO chests sheets, 4 barrells powder, 13 pieces perpet.tuanoes and 15 pieces sayes. If your honour shall please to order mee downe before Bracon can come along with mee to give satisfaction for the goods sold by him, hee proffers to send his cheife wife with mee to remayne till hee comes himselfe , whereunto I also desire your honours particular order; I only keepe the 3 hand canoe till I receive your Honours commands. Mr Towgood came in the roade today and waites for orders, the goods being already gon. I humbly begg your honours immediate particular answer to these concerns which shall be punctually obeyed. ***** 113.
