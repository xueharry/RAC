I SEKONDI The westernmost factory of the RAC on the Gold Coast at this period was at Sekondi ('Succondee' in these documents). The Company had had a factory here in the late 1670s, 1 but this clearly no longer existed by the beginning of 1681.2 As recorded elsewhere in the RAC correspondence (no.538), in February 1683 a vessel of the Company's, the Cape Coast, commanded by Hugh Shears, called at Sekondi to explore the possibility of re-settling the place, but received a discouraging res.ponse; but the attempt was evidently renewe d soon afterwards. The first letter reproduced in this section relates to an abortive attempt to re-establish the Sekondi lodge, again supported by Shears in the Cape Coast, in April l 683. In the following month, Shears was back at Sekondi, and again negotiated for the re-establishment of the lodge there (nos 538-4 1); and in June 1683, as the correspondence in this section shows, it was finally established. The Sekondi lodge was clearly intended primarily for trade in gold, though in the latest correspondence preserved in this period, in October 1683, there was also some suggestion of purchasing slaves (nos 30-3 1). The Dutch West India Company's principal lodge in this area was at Takoradi ('Tagarada'), west of Sekondi. ln 1681, as reported elsewhere in the RAC corre.spondence (no.36), the Dutch Company had also taken advantage of the temporary absence of the English from Sekondi to establish a lodge of their own in Sekondi; and the first English attempt to re-settle Sekondi in April 1683 was frustrated by the opposition of the Dutch (no. I). The Dutch withdrew their factory from Sek on di (and also from Takoradi) in July 1683, when these places were threatened with attack in a local war (no. IO). During this period of Dutch absence, the authorities at Takoradi invited the English to establish a factory there also, but nothing seems to have been done about this (nos 10-11, 16). In October 1683, however, the Dutch re-established their factories at both Sekondi and Takoradi (no.24). Sekondi and Takoradi had earlier been regard ed as belonging to the kingdom of Ahanta, 3 but the latter had come under attack from its northern neighbour, Adorn ('Addoome' in these documents) during 1681-2.4 In 1683, Sekondi was clearly dominated by Adorn, and it was the 'king' of Adorn, named here as 'Tickadoe' ,5 with whom the English negotiated for the settlement of their factory and subsequent trade. It is implied, indeed, that it was the Adorns who wanted an English factory at Sekondi, while the local people (or at least a substantial section of them) were opposed to the English settlement and disposed to ally rather with the Dutch. The authority of Adorn over the coasta l area was eviden tly still fragile, with rumour s of an impending second attack on Sekondi (which provoked the Dutch withdrawal in July 1683), though this did not in the event materialize. The traders bringing gold for sale at Sekondi came not only from Adorn itself, but also from Wassa, further north in the interior (nos 4, 16, 29, 31). 1. James Parri s Succondee , 25 Apr. 1683 These are to give you an account of our affaires here. Att our first comeing the Addoomes ordered us to bring our flagg and staff on shoare the which wee did, and on the sand the Dutch 6 sent all his people and slaves and tooke our staff from us and kept itt: soe I went on board the briganteen 7 and rideing att anchor here in the roade on the 23rd day being Monday att 11 of the clock att night the Addoomes came on board with two small canoes for to have us come on shoare againe with our flagg whereupon Coffee8 and Thomas Hendrick went on shoare to see what all the people did say, whereupon Thomas Hendrick came on board againe and told us that all the business was ended and to bring the flagg on shoare againe and hoyst ittand all was well, but the Dutch was much troubled and carryed some of his goods downe to the waterside to begon, and this townes Cabo sheers9 haveing taken a fittish 10 to be true to the Dutch from the General! of the Mina , 11 the Dutch factor fell out with them about hoysting our flagg here and sent for the Addoomes and proffered them what they would demand to take our flagg downe, but the Adoomes would not hearken to them, for they would have the English to live here, whereupon the Adoomes demanded of us 3 perpettuanoes, 4 sheets, 1 carbine and 1 paper brawle , the which Mr Shears sent on shoare and I have them now in my custody. The Dutch fiscall 12 is comeing up hither to put us away and this townes Cabosheer s are soe much affraid of the Dutch's displeasure that they have ordered us to begon. The Addoomes are geeing into the country and tells these Cabosheers that except the English lives here they will come immediatly and destroy them againe. Mr Shears hath been att a greate charge in liquors here in goeing to and fro and hoysting the flagg and now as I was wrighting they have pulled downe our flagg staff and I expect to goe aboard agaioe this day. They tell mee now they have orders from the Mina to pull downe our staff. 13 ***** 2. Mark Bedford Whiting Succond~e Factory, 12 June 1683 This is only to give your Worship an accompt that with the helpe of Mr Sheares 14 I was by the natives wellcom'd on shoare and have gotten free possession of the Royall Companys factory, but the Dutch [are] shamefully tum 'd out of doores, being not lookt upon, all the Blacks promiseing to be true and honest to the English, hopeing they will build a fort with a few gunns and [saying] that wee shall not want trade. Here is a great man come from Tickadoe the King of the Addoomes, whoe is goeing tomorrow to him to give him an account of my settlement here, whoe was sent downe for that purpose. Wee are now in want of blew perpettuanoes, sheets, powder and carbines and several] other goods as brandy , wee haveing expended the most part of that I brought , in dashey's 15 and makeing pallavora's, 16 as Captain Shears and Coffee can give you an account, but some dashey's are yett wanting for the King of the Addoomes and Captain Asshume 17 which I hope your Worship will furnish them suddenly. As for goods I have according to order gotten some of Captain Sheares, as your Worship may see per receipt, and have disposed of some to the vallue of 6 ounces. I hope here will be a good trade, nothing shall be wanting by mee to increase the same. 3.

Wee have now taken betwixt 4and 5 marks, I doe not questiona good trade.I must alsoeinformeyourWorshipof our small house here and by noe means wee cannot with safety secure theCompanys goods, but am forct to watch them night and day.

I wou ld wright your Worship oftener only am inwant of a canoe and to hyre a canoe every time is chargab le, the Dutch have them here for that purpo se. Pray faile not to supply us that the Adooomes may have noecause to complaine, I give them all the encouragement immaginab le. 4. Mark Bedford Whiting Succondee Factory, 26 June 1683 Your Worships of the 25th instant is come to hand by Captain Coffee, as alsoe the9 hand canoe, by which I have received the goods mentioned in the said letter, therebeing 3 pieces of Welch plaines damnified, baveing 6 or 7 wholes apeece in them.Your Worship hath risen the prizes of all sorts of goods [so) that I can in noe wayessell them att those rates, but as formerly sold by Mr Sheares as on the other sideappeares. I could have taken 2 marks of gold more this day if not risen. Wee are ingreat want of powder and was in hopes to have been supply'd by this canoe, thepeople are soe greedy for itt that they have intrusted mee with 3 marks of gold forthe same and would not lett me alone till I had dispatcht the canoe for the same.Here is money for 100 barreJls in the towne I beleeve, therefore upon receipt hereof I would have your Worship dispatch the canoe up heither with the same for Iunderstand that there is a ship at Dicki scove, 19 and I would not willingly lett slip soe good an oppertunity, for they will all be runing aboard, they have promised tostay untill Fryday morning and noe longer. Your Worship needs not question butthat the powder will be safe here, for I feare itt wiJI be taken all away att the waterside, and what is not wee can safely secure itt from any danger. Your Worship may send halfe barrells and some whole barrells , as alsoe some sheets and Guyney clouts and alsoe pautkaes blew, and scarlett cloath and blew. The Dutch canoe passed by this place for Tagarada with goods for that place as beade s, sheets, perpetuano's and brandy, but noe powder. They sell their green perpetuano's at 10a and blewes att 9a, brandy art 1 .a per gallon.2¡ Your Worship s perpettuanoes that you sent will not hold up with the greens, there being as many more greens and [sic: = than?] blews. 21 Tickadoe the King hath sent some of his people to Coffee for a hatt and a chayre they desireing to have itt sent up heither that they may canáy itt up with them in the country . Coffee tells mee that Griffin22 att Cape Coast can supply him with a chayre, but where to gett a hatt I cannot tell. The Dutchman is still here, haveing nae goods only brandy and a few beades, as for brandy wee shall want for next Tuseday is the time of their danceing here 23 and according to contract made wee are to give the Cabasheers of this towne a perpetuanoe and one broad tapsell which wee have not here, as alsoe 2 halfe ankors of brandy. I beleeve that snap pans is a great commodyty here, for the people of this place runs as far as Accoda to the Brandenburgs 24 to buy them, whoe sells them att 5 angles a peece . I am glad your Worship will provide us a 5 hand canoe which wee want here much, there being scarcity of canoes att this place , I would have your Worship send her up alsoe by the canoe. I have according to order sent your Worship by David March what gold was in cash on account of the Royall Affrican Company and shall alsoe send itt by all safe conveyance; I now.send you 7 marks, I hope to make itt 7 more before the month is out. Ile doe my endeavour, but powder is the thing which I would have your Worship send up by all meanes without delay and dispatch the canoe as soone as arrived unless others come and take all the money. Wee expect ships every day to trade here there being two to windward. [inclosure] Prizes of goods as Mr Sheares sold them here sheets: 28 per bendy -wee want them long cl oaths att 1 Oa niccanees narrow att 3.a -wee want a hundred more perpetuano's blew att IOa, greens att 9a and redds att 8a Welch plaines blews att 1 Oa, greens att 9a and redds att 8a paper brawles att 2.a -will not sell att that rate but att 2a Guyney clouts 24 per bendy -wee want them much sletias course att Sa -will not sell att that rate iron barrs 24 per bendy 2 lb basons att 1 a -will not sell att that rate 4 lb basons att 2a -will not sell att that rate 3 lb ditto will not sell alt that rate, [but will] att 1 .a sayes att 15 angles -doe not sell well here firkins of tallow att 4a [per] halfe firkins -will not sell att that rate powder att 1 o 8a -wee want much. [PS] Since my wrighting this letter the Addoomes and Wassaers mett together before the factory being about a hundred in company there, they made a greate pallavora, Coffee and I being sent for by them, saying that unless your Worship would abate the prizes of goods they would goe to Dickiscove or to the Dutch att Tagarada and lay out their money, wondering why the goods should be risen of a sudden and not sold att Mr Shears rates or as on board the Companys ships. Their prizes is this, they will give but 4a for tapsells narrow and 4a for niccanees, alsoe 9a for green perpetuano's and 10a forblews, 2 lb basons 9 for 8a and 4 lb ditto l .a, Guyney clouts 7 for 8a, paper brawles att 2a each, sletias course 4a, tallow 3a the halfe firkin, powder 1 ounce and ., sayes att 15 angles, blew pautkaes l .a.

Mark Bedford Whiting Succondee Factory, 27 June 1683 Just now arrived a canoe from Axim whoe informed us and the Dutch Copeman 26 here that yesterday night arrived att the said place a French pyrate whoe forct two ships under the protection of that fort.27 This serves only to give your Worship advice [so] that Mr Sheares may not venture up heither. This is certa inely true. The Dutch I beleeve will give your Worship noe advice therefore [I] could not trust to them, allthough they sent advice to the Mina. Pray faile not to send us more niccanees narrow but powder especially and dispatch this canoe up heither with the 9 hand canoe immediatly upon receipt hereof. [PS] Pray fay le not to send us a chayre and a hatt for Tickadoe for the people are verry urgent to be gon, as alsoe Captain Assumes cloath and hatt not forgetting powder. 6. Marke Bedford Whiting Succondee Factory, 30 June 1683 Your Worships of the 28th instant I have per the 9 hand canoe with the goods mentioned in the letter, wherein your Worship wrights as to the prizes of goods. I shall observe your Worships orders as to that matter although I cannot sell them all, att the Castles rates, 28 here being an interloper one Captain Parris of Barbado's that undersells mee in some sorts of goods, as tallow att 3 angles the halfe firkin and other goods which bee sells att lower rates, which att present am not sencible of itt. I wrote your Worship per the 9 hand canoe for more sheets and niccanees, but received none, I have but one chest and halfe left and some of them are damnified and a parcell of sayes which came out of Mr Sheares his ship, which I feare [I] must sell by the fathom to the best advantage. The small tapsells will not vend at 5 angles, but att 4 angles as the niccanees, which goes well att that price, but the tapsells I have not sold one. Yours of [=by] John Downes is come to hand, I have accordingly sent a canoe to Dickiscove aboard of a Dutch interloper, one skeeper Johnson, whoe I am inform'd can give intelligence of the pyrate, att the retume of the canoe I shalJ according to order send her downe to your Worship. The said interloper sells abundance of sheets and snap pans. I inquired on board of Captain Parris whether bee saw any ships to windward, whoe tells mee noe, only spoke with the said interloper att Dickiscove whoe said nothing to him of any pyrate. Captain Parris informes mee that Captain Nurse was safe arrived att Barbado's when hee came thence which is about 5 months, alsoe Captain North whoe went thence to Jamaica. Captain Attwell run 40 slaves ashoare upon his own accoUJnt att Barbado's and some of his men inform'd against him, and when hee was examined hee confessed the thing, soe they multed29 him; his gunner is aboard of the said Parris whoe left the ship att Barbado's, [he] and severall others they lost all their wages. The scarlett cloath and hatt for Captain Asshume is delivered him whoe is well satisfied and thanks your Worship. Wee shall take care to send the carpett, chayre and hatt for Tickadoe when any of his people comes downe. I have disposed of the best part of the powder, itt will not be long before the other goes off. These interlopers have done mee a little injury, they being here before the canoe came up. I am glad your Worship will send us a 2 hand canoe itt being a thing necessary att this place. 7. Marke Bedford Whiting Succondee Factory, 2 July 1683 This is to acquaint your Worship that just now arrived the Dutch interloper fromDickiscove here and accordingly I sent a canoe on board to enquire of the pyrate, and hee writt mee word that there is one to windward of 40 gunns, whoe [he]beleeves itt is Van Home, hee cannot justly tell. The said interloper was chased byhim from Ashinee30 to Axim, where hee left him, and went up to windward againe, and his intent is to stay a little to windward of Ashinee, and take ships as they comedowne. Here is a Compa nys ship att Dickiscove, whoe I beleeve is Captain Phenneyin a small ship, I am informed bee was never upon the coast before. The Dutchinterloper spoke with him yesterday night, and desired him not to stay there, but togoe downe to Cabo Corsoe. Here the ships are ready for a fight. The Companysship intends to wood and water att Dickiscove, shee past by Ashinee in the nightand soe [I] beleeve escap'd the pyrate. This interloper hath been 7 months out ofHolland. The other pyrate that went downe last, chased alsoe this man att Cestus. 31 Hee tells that Van Horns stearmen is aboard of that pyrate that went to leward andalsoe that Van Home will take all nations. Here the Dutch interloper sells sheets 30per bendy and snap pans 8 per bendy, tallow 3 angles per [half?] firkin.32I mustexpect to sell nothing as long as they lye here. 8.

As to shiping to windward I heard of one yesterday being att Axim , I am inform'd by the Blacks that itt is a greate EngJish ship. Wee are in want of boysado's and sheets, alsoe perpetuano's. I must info1me you that here is one Cabasheer Yankey 44 that doth perswade Tickado's people not to goe downe. Captain Coffee knowes him verry well. 19. Marke Bedford Whiting Succondee Factory, 15 Sept. 1683 Your Worships of the 10th and 11th I have received with lOpieces ofWelchplaines which I disposed of att their arrival!. This accompany's Tickado's Cabasheers whoe after many perswasions was willing to come downe to end the pallavora with your Worship . I now send downe alsoe Captain Coffee, with 3 marks of gold, itt being all that I have in cash att present. Here is a greate deale of gold in towne, but all for powder, which they could not be supplyed with by Captain Browse, hee haveing disposed of all to windward. I have not disposed of anything since the said ships arrivall, only the Welch plaines your Worship sent last , and if I had more, I could sell them all att their arrivall. The people wanting powder is a greate hinderance to mee, for they send all their gold aboard for powder, and when they come there, they buy other goods. Here in towne I beleeve [there is] above 20 marks for powder. I want more goods, as boysado's, sheets, perpetuano's, but our house is not fitt to put any goods in. I now send inclosed James Parris's inventory of what things hee left at his death. When the greate canoe comes I shall send them downe to your Wor.ship, with my monthly accompts. Here is noe news to windward . As to what your Worship wrights concerning Samuell Chambers I undertake I shall follow itt. 20. Mark Bedford Whiting Succondee Factory, 18 Sept. 1683 Your Worships of the 15th instant I have received per the 9 hand canoe with thegoods as per inclosed receipt appeares. As for the powder I shall keepe it tillTickado 's Cabasheer comes up againe. I now send downe per the bearer hereof myaccompt with the ballance of itt being 7 ounces, 9 angles and 3 tacco 's of gold onaccompt of the Royall Affrica n Company. I must informe your Worship that 3pieces of boysado's are verry much damnifi ed, but I shaU endeavour to dispose ofthem to the best advantage on account of said Company. As to news to windward I know of none, only 1heare of a Dutch Companys ship being att Aboni [sic: =Abeni].45 Here passed by the other day a small vessell, what shee was I know not.Per this canoe your Worship will alsoe receive James Parris his things. 21. Mark Bedford Whiting Succondee Factory, 22 Sept. 1683 Your Worships of the 17th and 20th instant I have received together with 10 piecesof green Welch plaines, on account of the Royall Affrican Company whereof [ haveenclosed receipt but for 8, haveing given your Worship a receipt before for 10 when I received but 8 which was my mistake, I humbley returning your Worship thanksfor adviseing mee thereof. I have according to your Worships order sent a canoe toAxim, and another to Dickiscove to the Cabbasheers of that place to demandsatisfaction of them for soe verry highly abuseing the English, which att the returneof the canoe I shall give your Worship an account thereof. As concerning the setlemen [t] of this place, the Addooms are come downe and are willing to complywith your Worships proffer, and here doe stay to know whether your Worship iswilling to lett them have 10 bendy's worth of goods out of this factory; if yourWorship is willing to comply with I shall follow your orders therein and furnish them according ly. 22. Mark Bedford Whiting Succondee Factory, 24 Sept. 1683 This is to acquaint your Worship that the Caboshee r that made the pallavora withyour Worship hath been with Tickadoe and is come downe againe whoe infonnesmee that his master is willing to accept of the proffer made by your Worship, soethat if your Worship is pleased, that hee should be furnished here, I can furnish himwith a parcell of damaged goods whoe is willing to except of the same att the sameprice as if they were good, soe expecting an answer as to that matter. 23. Mark Bedford Whiting Succondee Factory , 28 Sept. 1683 Your Worships of the 26th instant I have received together with the articles, which the Addoomes will not signe to un less your Worship will take 6 peaze for every bendy, being unwilling to take the same for every bendy's worth of goods.46 Tickado's Cabasheere came downe yesterday with whome Hansacoe made the pallavora concerning that matter, but could not bring him to any reasonable terms, saying that if they had proffered any such thing to the Dutch, they would not make soe many words, Tickadoe being unwi lling to entertaine them any more att this place. If your Worship is willing to Jett them have 6 peaze for every bendy 's worth of goods they will all signe the articles and take their fittish upon itt. As to the annual! charges they are all contented wit h [them]. Wee told them that the Company hath beene att a considerable charge in settleing the factory and with the annuall charges will amount to a greate sume of money. I shall take care to send up Captain Coffee, Atta47 with Samuell Chambers to Tickadoe to signe the articles att the retume of your Worships answe r. Here is enclosed a letter from Mons ieur Scheffe r at Axim. 48 As to Dickiscove people the Cabasheers hath promised to send a Cabasheere of that place up to Succondee that thereby wee may know what reaso n they have Loabuse the English. Here arrived att this place two Dutch interlopers and an English one, whoe went hence for Shuma49 yesterday. The Dutch interloper hath taken a cons iderable parcell of money art this place for powder, att 5 peaze and 2 angles per barren, heare came ashoare yesterday att least 35 barrells. 24. Marke Be dford Whiting Succondee Fac tory, 1 Oct. 1683 This is to acqua int your Worship that the Dutch last Sunday came here on shoare with a quantity of goo ds as sheets, beades and ginghams att 4 a clock in the morning, unknowne to these townes people, in order to resettle their factory which they pretend they left for want of goods and now being furnished will settle all places aga ine.50 The ir arrival l here is unknowne to the Addooms wboe have often promised never to entertaine them noe more att this place . I have in order to this sent Capta in Coffee , Samuell Chambers and Atta h up to Tickadoe to acquaint him of itt, and to signe the articles of agreement, which if they signe they must either put the Dutch off or elce forfeite 100 marks according to the said agreement. Here is a greate disturbance att this place, some being for their staying and some for their goeing off, and if they stay they will undersell us in beades and sheets, which theybrought a considerable quantity. Sheets they sell 7 for 2 peaze and 8 for 2 peaze,that is 15 for an ounce. Here hath been dull trade with mee this month, but a goodtrade for those Dutch interlopers which sold a greate quantity of powder att 5 peazeper barrell, snap pans att 9 per bendy and those commodyty's swept up a consider.able parcell of money. As to what your Worship writes concerning Captain Wool.man s letter51 your Worship is misinform' d for I received the same from CaptainSmith s owne hand when the ship was under saile and past by Taggarada and beforeshe anchored here, the said letter was sent by mee to Cabo Corsoe, which is a thing impo ssible that a ship should be att the Mina 6 dayes when shee never was there.As concerning Mr Scheffer's letter, here is noe secure passage for any Blacks togoe, there being a differance betwixt the people of this place and Dickiscove,neither can I send a canoe unless I byre itt on purpose, itt is verry seJdome that anyof these cano 's goe thither unless itt be canoes sent from the Mina and soe stop herefor refreshment. 25. Mark Bedford Whiting Succondee Factory, 3 Oct. 1683 This accompany 's Hansacoe by whom e your Worship will understand how affairesstands att this place, alsoe this is to Jett your Worship understand that CaptainCoffee, Attah and Samuell Chamber s, after foure dayes journey towards the Ad.dooms was forct to come back againe, meeting some of the Addooms by the waywhoe inform'd them that Tickad oe and rest of the Cabasheers of Mampone 52 aregon up to Wassa coun try which prevented their journ ey up, yett notwithstandingwee have taken care to send up a man to him to acquaint him of the Dutch landinghere and of a White English man comeing up to Mampone, which if hee heares noedoubt but bee will come back. Here the Dutch doe undersell us both in sheets andbeades , selling their sheets alt 32 per bendy and wee 28 per bendy which is a greate deale of differanc e. I have not sold neither sheets nor beades since their arrivall.Sheets are the best commodyty that vends here. I shall take care to send downe thegold per Captain Coffee next weeke. I have taken care to send your Worships lettertoAxim. 26. Mark Bedford Whiting Succondee Factory, 5 Oct. 1683 Since my last to your Worship per Hansacoe your Worship s of the 4th instant I have received wherein I shall observe your Worships order in lowering the sheets and greene perpetuano's. The Dutch have had this morning a fresh supply of goods as sayes, perpetuanoe's, broad tapsells , ginghams and beades; I understand that the Generall of the Mina is resolved to supply their factory here with all sorts of goods, and to sell them att low rates only to draw the country peop le in, and to gett us off of this place. The other day when I sent Coffee , Atta and Samuell Chambers to acquaint Tickadoe of the Dutch landing here, as soone as the Dutch Copeman heard of itt, bee presently sent for the Cabbasheers desireing them to goe and prevent us of our journey, which they came accordingly and would needs know what was the reason I sent a Whiteman to Tickadoe , and I would not inform e them of itt, I asked them againe what was the reason they entertained the Dutch here after have ing made soe many promises never to entertaine them noe more, and for that verry reason I send a Whiteman to the Addoomes to acquaint them of itt, to knowe wheither they approve of it, then they desired mee to stay a weeke longer, I made answer that itt was your Worships order and I was not to observe theirs; then leave was granted, upon the condition that I had noe intent to doe any of this townes people any harme, yett notwithstanding they sent the Tetee53 of this towne along with Samuell Chambers to heare what pallavora was made betwixt Tickadoe and us, whome they are in greate feare of, and soe are the Dutch. Here is one Cabasheer that is ordered by the Addooms to looke after the English whoe is a greate enemie of the Dutch and hath promised to doe his endeavour to gett the Dutch off, hee hath sent one of his men to Tickadoe to acquaint him of the Dutch landing here, hee told the Cabasheers of this place that if they would use noe means to gett them off, hee would; they tould him againe that they[= the Dutch] were here before and that they bad noe reason to putt them off. The Dutch man heareing of the said Cabasheere standing up for the English , hee sent him word that one day hee hop 'd to see him at the Mina without his head, bee sent him word againe that bee had not better speake too much, least Tickadoe make him carry his stoole after him. The Dutch sells their perpetuano's greene att 8 angles each, ours are farr before them, some of the Black s loves their collor best itt being a deeper dye; they sell alsoe their sheets at 32 per bendy, bee haveing lowered his price two dayes agoe telling the Negro's that if they would bring their money to him, and not carry itt to the English bee would sell 32 per bendy. Hee alsoe sells ginghams att 5 angles each, being 9 for 2 peaze. Beades he sells great quantity's of. As to sayes and broad tapsells I know not how bee sells them, they comeing on shoare but this morning. Wee are in want of perpetuano's, greene Welch plaines and sheets. Sheets I have not sold any since this Dutch arrivall, only this morning att the receiveing of your letter I sold a bendy's worth att 32 per bendy according to your Worships order. As to my monthly ac.compts, I shall endeavour to send Coffee with itt next weeke, with the ballance of itt. I have according to your Worships orders sent Mynheer Schiffer[s] letter to Axim, when I have an answer from thence itt shall be forwarded to your Worshipwith all expedition. 27. Marke Bedford Whiting Succondee Factory , 8 Oct. 1683 This is to acquaint yom Worship that last night the towne of Succondee was sett onfire in three severall places, by whome wee know not. The Cabasheers houses areall bur[n]t and if care had not been taken by the said Cabas heers our factory wouldhave been bur[n)t too, but I thank God wee escaped the same and soe did the Dutchwhoe escaped verry narrowly, one of the houses was blowne up with powder,haveing in one halfe barrell which burnt six severall people which I feare will notlive. Here is a greate many Wassa 's in towne which hath given mee in hand 9 marksof gold for powder att 6 pease per barrell which if your Worship can possibly supply them, they will take itt off my bands from the waterside and carry itt up to Wassacountry least itt should come to any damage in the towne. Here the Dutch are lettalone in their wayes, noe body doth molest them , they sell abundance of beade sand sheets alsoe ginghams and a few perpetuano's. If I had a better house on thetop of the hill, where I could be out of danger of any fire and had a quantity of eachsort of goods I should make a good hand of itt. The Dutch sells his sayes att l ounce,the Negro's loves their sayes better then ours, they esteeme their collour better. Iam in want of green Welch plaines , perpetuano's, sheets (blew Welch plaines arenoe commod ity here, I have a parcell of them but will not sell). I have not yett hadany news from the Addoomes, here is one of the said peopl e in towne whoe infor.mes mee that foure dayes hence Tick adoe will send downe one of his Cabasheersheithe r. As concern ing Mr Scheffer J have noe answer as yett. Had not this firehappened last night I would have sent my accompts to your Worship according toyour Worships order, but now I am takeing care to gett the thatch to cover the house againe which was taken downe last night for feare of the fire. As soone as itt is finished Coffee shall come downe with the said accompts and the gold. 28. Mark Bedford Whiting SuccondeeFactory, 15 Oct. 1683 Your Worships of the 13th instant is come to hand toget her with the powder and the green Welch plaine s per the 9 hand canoe. The powder I disposed according topromi se wh ich now I send downe the product of the same with my monthly ac.compts with the baJlance thereof per this conveyance. I humbley begg your Wor.ships pardon for not finishing my September accompt before. Had not this firehappened which caused us to pull downe the thatch off the house and made us takecare for the cover ing of the same againe, I had finished them some dayes agoe , butfor the future I shall observe your order per your last. I hope in a sho11time to beout of danger of any fire that shall happen in towne, when the -Royall Companysfactory is built, which is now put forwards, the people of this pface being about itt, some are goo to cutl wood, some to make durt, others are rowsaing 54 the ground where your Worship ordered itt should be built. I shall be in this as spareing and in all other things as spareing as possible in order to the Royall Companys benefitt. I have according to your Worships order gott the articles of agreement signed by the Cabasheers of Mampone by order ofTic kadoe,55 they promiseing to putt the Dutch off and att the signing of the said articles, they made the Cabasheers of this towne take their fittish to be true and faithfull to the English. I delivered according to contract IOgreen perpetua no's, whereof most of them being damaged and lOgreen Welch plaines att the signing of the agreement. As to Dickiscove pallavora, I cannot come to speake with any of the Cabasheers of the said place, the people ofthis place haveing abused some of their wives which hath bred a differance betwixt them both soe that they panyar 56 one anothe r. Tickadoe is comei ng downe to fight that place, they haveing alsoe abused the Addooms severall times, and when hee doth come bee hath sent the Dutch here word that he will not show them a trick unless they remove. Wee are in great want for more powder alsoe brass basons which are a greate comodyty amongst the Wassa's, here being above 100 bendy's in towne att this time for those two sorts of comodyty's. If the Royall Companys factory was built and was but supplyed with powder, sheets and brass basons and green Welch plaines, the Dutch would take but little gold, and that as they would take would be for beades. If your Worship can possibly spare more powde r I have ready money in hand for 30 barrells and here is also 10 bendy's for brass basons which I hope your Worship will be soe kind as to supply us with. I now send your Worship 7 marks, 7 ounces per the bearer hereof hopeing your Worship will supply us with the abovesaid goods. I must informe your Worship that the Wassa's are in great want of perpetuano's blew, the Dutch here have great quantity of them but the coun try people will not buy them being less then ours. 29. Mark Bedford Whiting Succondee Factory, 20 Oct. 1683 This is to acquaint your Worship that here is come to towne a greate many Wassa's and Addoomes whoe are want of sheets, perpetuano's, brass basons, powder. They might be supplyed here from the Dutch with some of these goods, but being ordered to the contrary by Tickadoe [not] to have any thing to doe with the said people. I have a few sheets but not enough, alsoe a few perpetuano's but noe blew ones to put the green off. The said country people are willing to stay soe many dayes, according to contract untill your Worship can possibley supply them. I must in.forme your Worship that Mr Scheffer of Axim was unwilling to put the 9 hand canoe in the 15 hand canoe least the 15 hand canoe should come to any harme neither would hee suffer them to be lasht together, soe that bee was forst to hyre 5men more to bring the 9 hand canoe downe which I discharg'd here and paid them2 angles per man. Here came the other day a fresh supply of goods for the Dutch,as perpetuano's , sheets, and brandy. Perpetuano' s, hee sells as we does, blews attI0a and green att 9a and reds att 8a. As to news I heare of none, neither doe I heare of any shiping to windward. If your Worship can possibly spare Coffee I humblydesire of your Worship to send him up, that hee may overlooke the people that arebuilding the Royall Companys factory , hee knowing how itt was contrived before,bee then being here att the building of itt. 30. Mark Bedford Whiting Succondee Factory, 22 Oct. 1683 Your Worships of the 20th instant I have received together with the 91 brass basons,which shall be disposd according to your Worships order, on accompt of the RoyallAffrican Company. I wrote your Worship per the Axim canoes for some sheets,alsoe perpetuano 's, powder, and if your Worship can spare us more basons of thatsize (if not bigger) I can dispose of them. But as for powder, sheets and perpetuano'sblew, wee are in greate want which I humbly begg your Worship to supply us withthat wee may keepe the money from the Dutch whoe are well supply'd with thesetwo sorts of commodyty's, sheets and perpetuano's, and although their per.petuano 's are most blew yett the country people chusing rather to stay for a freshsupply of ours, they being far better then the Dutch which are but small. Here is agreate quant ity of gold in towne for powder and other goods. Tickadoe bath sentbeither a lusty man slave and hath promised to send downe more if your Worshipis willing to buy them, they aske for the said slave 7 peaze , but I proffer them but6 and if your Worship is willing to comply with I humbly begg of your Worship tosupply us with snap pans for the said slave, they being unwilling to take any othersort of goods. As to the Royall Companys factory itt goes forward and if yourWorship can possibly spare Coffee I humbly begg of your Worship to send him up. 31. Mark Bedford Whiting Succondee Factory, 27 Oct. 1683 Your Worships of the 24th instant I have received per Captain Coffee with thefollowing goods vizt 2 bayles containing 50 perpetuano's, 92 brass basons contain.ing 325 pounds, 5 chests containing 325 sheets, 10 barrells of gun powder, 50pieces greene Welch plaines and 20 snap pans on accompt of the Royall AffricanCompany of England. The powder I disposed att the waterside with other goods, Ihave alsoe disposed of most of the greene Welch plaines. If your Worship canpossibly spare us more greens with redd and yallow but noe blews, they being notin demand here; I have a parcell here of blews, I could wish your Worship wouldbe pleased to exchange them for redd and yallow, perhapps blews are better at CaboCorsoe. As concern ing the brass panns I cannot gett more then 7 taccoes per pound and hardly that, I have disposed of 3 bendy's worth of them after that rate, haveing used all possible meanes to gett 8 tacco's per pound but cannot prevaile. As to the snap pans your Worship sent for the procureing of slaves, the slave that I wrote your Worship about was redeemed by some of the Wassa's, whoe gave the Addooms a bendy for his redemption before the said snap pans came on shoare and with the said money [the latter] bought part of the snap pans alt 8 per bendy, they being for Tickado's present occasion. Here is a good trade at present and as soone as the Royall Compa nys factory is finished I hope your Worship will be soe kind as to supply us with all sorts, then wee shall make a good hand of itt for some loves one sort of a thing and some loves other sorts. I shall send downe next weeke what money is in cash. Here is noe news to windward, some canoes came from A,um yesterday and noe shiping is to windward .
