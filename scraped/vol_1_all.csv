<p>I wrote your Honour in my last that I would inlarge in my next, this being the sequall. Thought might have kist your hand ere this, but the canoe per via Annamaboe past unknowne to mee in the night. I suppose your honour hath heard how Captain Mingham and his Docter parted and the reasons therefore, hee haveing threatned the Captains death by poyson [he] was unwilling to carry him farther for feare his devilish threats might take place, and worke to strongly on such evill minded persons. Hee arrived here and not being well, stay'd 2 dayes and was blooded per Samuell Stone, and some of his men being sick aboard did desire the Captain that hee would speake to mee that Samuell Stone might goe with them in the ship. Hee made severall propositions to him before I knew itt, and [Stone] said if I would give my consent hee would goe, and being earnestly desired per Captain Mingham to lett him goe, I told him I durst not, unless your Honour would order <span id=""page198"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-977"">pg 198</span></span>mee. Hee offered mee and has given mee his obligation for 100£ sterling to indemnify mee from the Company and your honour, and hope your honour will not think itt ill done since hee is still in the Companys service and may be more beneficiall in that imploy then here. I alsoe had one bendy to pay what he owed Captain Phipps and myselfe etc. and one months pay that was due to him, and if that hee stayed here on[e] hundred years in the capacity hee was in hee would never have paid what he owed, although I gave him his dyett and cloathed him. I suppose your honour has been informed per Mr Towgood how the slaves would have rose upon us, but being prevented all is well. I have, humbley begging your pardon, put on board Captain Branfill the 4 greatest rogues and 4 woemen, and have received in leiw thereof 170 ounces of corrall, which hope will turne to better advance, for itt eats noe corne, which now is deare. And the canoe which went up with Mr Winder received verry much damage, soe that I could not mend her here, soe have sold her to Captain Branfill for 8 sletias, which shall have creditt in this months account and is more then her prime cost. I have hindred all canoes from tradeing with him in this roade, soe that now hee is 3 leagues to leward at Tishee. The Dutchman here paniard some goods that I had sold some Acquomboes, and I have donne the like by him when I caught the goods hee sold, as hee did in my towne, soe pray informe the Dutch Generall if hee gave him such orders, for I conjecture that hee doth itt out of mallice that they bought them here, and He not be wanting to doe as he doth after I heare your answer, neither will I release what I have till hee doth, because hee made the first beginning. This I hope may find your honour with all Gentlemen in prosperous health as itt now leaves mee. Here is now in this road and in this place 4 sayle of ships vizt Captain Branfill and 2 interlopers, whose names I know not but one the blacks tells mee is one Salloway a Dutch interloper, and Thomas Travers whoe arrived here yesterday. I have here inclosed sent my Decembers account, which was forgott in my last, and humbly intreate your honour that Docter Askin may be here in case of accidents, being now noe more then 6 whitemen.</p>

<p>Whereas John Thorne in his letter of the 28th January last accuseth me of the following misdemeanours:</p>
<p>lstly. That upon my arrivall at Ophra the 12th day of Febuary 1681/2 I desired the Phidalgoe that I might reside in his country and that he would protect me from Mr Smith, whome I pretended was my enemy and would have me to Guidah; of which (he saith) I had advice before from Mr Spurvay</p>
<p>2ndly. That I received a letter from Mr John Smith the 22nd following wherein I was desired by him, to make all possible hast to Guidah, did acquaint the Phidalgoe that Mr Smith had sent for me with an intent to withdraw the factory from Ophra, and that I againe desir'd his protection, which being granted, he saith I wrote to Mr Smith that I was detained by the Phidalgoe and could not possibly come to Guidah. 3rdly. Being demanded by the said John Thorne, why I was so unwilling to goe <span id=""page253"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1185"">pg 253</span></span>with Mr Smith when return'd to Guidah from Ophra, I answered Mr Smith had a mind to keepe me at Guidah, and come to settle at Ophra himselfe, that I had received severall abuses from whitemen at Guidah and that I thought it not a place fitt for a factory, in regard the prices of slaves was exhaurted to 25 per cent more then at Ophra.</p>
<p>4thly. That Mr Smith came to Ophra in the night with a spare hammack, and being without sent Francis Capell to the factory, acquainting me with his designe and desireing me to come to him, which (he saith) I did, and as I went acquainted some of the Phidalgoes people therewith, whereupon the towne was up in arms and Mr Smith forct to goe without me.</p>
<p>5thly. That Captain Richard Shepheard being arrived at Guidah I desired John Thome to speake to the Phidalgoe to lett me goe on board him, but he being doubtfull of my returne was unwilling to lett me goe, upon which he saith I proffered him a bond of 100£,<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1186"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1186""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-422"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1186"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>71</sup></a></span> and another to the Phidalgoe of 60 slaves to be forfeited if I did not returne, upon which consideration leave was granted to me.</p>
<p>6thly. That the said John Thorne did often solicite me to take care for his departure from Ophra and that I would send him booges to maintaine the factory, and not lett the Companys barrs be sold at soe pittifull a price as 3 pound of booges, to which (he saith) I never returned him an answer</p>
<p>To which particulars I returne these answers:</p>
<p>To the 1st. I acknowledge I arrived at Ophra around the time John Thorne mentions, but that I had any intention to reside there I utterly deny; neither did I ever request the Phidalgoe to protect me from Mr Smith, having no other intention but to returne to Guidah as soone as I had completed my business, and acquainted the Phidalgoe with the Agent Generalls and Councills instructions; and as to what he saith that I had notice from Mr Spurvay of Mr Smiths ill intentions towards me, I call God to wittness I never received any letter from him in my life; neither doe I remember I ever soe much as mentioned his name to John Thorne.</p>
<p>To the 2nd. I acknowledge that I wrote to Mr Smith in answer to his of 22nd February that the Phidalgoe did detaine me, and that I had soe great a watch over me that I could not possibly make my escape, but that it was my owne contrivance, I againe call God to wittness, tis a most notorious lye, and I hope not to be credited; since Thorne doth attest in the 5th article, that I went on shoare at Guidah, and forfeited bonds I had given for my returne.</p>
<p>To the 3rd. I acknowledge I did often say that I thought Ophra more convenient for the Companys factory then Guidah, by reason of the cheapness of carrying goods to the factory from the waterside was not soe great, and that slaves were to be had there at a far lower rate. As to what he saith that I told him of Mr Smiths designe to keep me at Guidah and settle himself at Ophra, I doe attest that the said John Thorne did endeavour to perswade me Mr Smith had such a designe, which I never <span id=""page254"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1187"">pg 254</span></span>credited, knowing he did it on purpose, to alienate my affections from the said Mr Smith.</p>
<p>To the 4th. I can safely take my corporall oath,<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1188"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1188""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-423"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1188"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>72</sup></a></span> that when I went out of the factory to Mr Smith, I did it with as real a designe to make my escape with him to Guidah as ever I did any thing in my life, and might have gon away had not Thorne sent the Blacks to panyare us.</p>
<p>To the 5th. I acknowledge it true, and that I did give a bond of 100£ to John Thorne and of 30 Slaves to the Phidalgoe for my returne to Ophra, without which I could not possibly escape, and here I desire John Thornes roguery may be taken notice of, for if he had noe designe to prevent my goeing away, why did he make me give him a bond to assure him of my returne.</p>
<p>To the 6th. I confess I never sent John Thorne any booges, it being contrary to my orders to send any goods or any person there till he was gon off.</p></div></div>"

<p>This conveyance brings the several coppyes of what wee wrotte you upon the receipt of yours mentioning the unfortunate loss of the 15 hand canoe etc. Per ours to your honour at that time you will find how affaires where with us at that time. According to the dates of them wee have expected some answer, for the want of which Captain Bowler is very impatient, not knowing what it may meane, and likewise his provissions growing very short he is compelled to depart the coast. Wee have desired of ditto Bowler this morning how long he intends to stay for answer from your Honour, he replyed that in his letter bearing date the 25th ultimo he hath signified his mind, the limitt of which time he is resolved not to exceed now, fearing that his with our letters of the same date may not come to hand. Wee have this possitive answer from him, that within 5 dayes from this date he intends for Accra and there to land the remaines, soe go off the coast with those Negroes that are on board, Mr Nightingale having refused to take the goods ashore at this place, it beeing as he sayes besides his orders to doe it. Wee have been heere this last time about 11 or 12 dayes. Indeed our trade gives but little incoura[ge]ment, wee having purchased few slaves. The Queen of Anguinna came to this towne on Thursday last, has promised the payment of some part of her debt to the Roy all Affrican Company of England, and as the Negroes say is ready with her pawnes for the settlement of a factory here. She likewise promises the best of her indeavour for procuring slaves.</p>
<p><span id=""page303"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1413"">pg 303</span></span>She hath allready done this for us (there being an English interloper who came down here the 4th insten, one Richard Lumley Commander) to put one of the natives in irons at the factory, for sending a slave aboard of him, and has commanded that he be put one board of us. Wee have had an ill accident befalling us aboard, which is the loss of a hogshead of our Negroe brandy, and likewise a great part of our Negroe bread has been throwne over board since wee came here, it being old bread when bought in England as may be beleeved, and not fitt for use. There is absolute necessity for a recruite of brandy for the Negroes, without which if wee depart the coast it may be the loss of many of our Negroes in the voyage. This being the needfull wee humble desire your Honour may be pleased to send us a speedy answer.</p></div></div>"

  <div class=""div2 editorial prelim""><a name=""actrade-9780197261767-div2-212""></a><p>The RAC factory at Anomabu ('Annamaboe') had been established in 1679.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-493"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-493""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-196"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-493"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>1</sup></a></span> It was occupied continuously through the period 1681–3; the same man, Richard Thelwall, serving as chief factor there throughout. As is alluded to in this correspondence (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-246#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-557"">no.242</a>) the factory in 1681 was in the process of being fortified (with 'flankers', or defensive earthworks). It was already known as Charles Fort; although Thelwall's letters never use this name, it does appear in a letter written from Anomabu by a visiting ship in 1682 (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div4-36#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1288"">no.529</a>). The factory supplied mainly gold, but also some slaves; it was also important for the provision of corn to slave-ships, and served as a base for fishing for oyster shells (burned to produce lime for building), at the sandbank off Amisa ('Amersa', 'Amessa') to the east.</p>
<p>Anomabu, like Anashan to the west (and Egya to the east) belonged to the state of Fante ('Fanteene'); hence the factory sent representatives to negotiate with 'the Quantrees and Braffo' at Fante (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-219#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-510"">nos 215</a>, <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-251#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-565"">247–8</a>), and the town's own chiefs went to Fante to attend the celebration of 'their Christmas day' (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-281#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-623"">no. 277</a>). The hinterland traders, as at Anashan, were the Akani ('Arcanies'). Recurrently trade from the interior to Anomabu was interrupted by Kabestera and other states in the immediate interior associated with it (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-272#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-605"">nos 268–9</a>, <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-329#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-702"">325</a>, <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-362#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-751"">358</a>).</p></div>

<p>Inclosed goes copie of my last via St Thoma per Captain Ware, who departed this place thee 3rd instant, although had all his Negro's aboard the 28th past and upon thee same day took his leave of this our towne, although tarryed below att Captain Wybornes severall day's, which with his leaving behind but 21 iron barrs in the factory creates the suspition in mee of his haveing many more slaves aboard then his complement, for that Mr Thomson whoe acted and did all the business in the buying the slaves, upon the 28th instant told mee that then they had their full complement, when that I was assured hee had not disposed of in silke more then 2 slaves, and what became of the rest I leave your Worship to judge, as likewise a <span id=""page246"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1161"">pg 246</span></span>parcell of corrall and some muzlins which were not here disposed of. As not seeing their invoyces could not make any computation, but tooke notice of what goods they had, an account whereof goes here inclosed, with their prize how disposed of, by which your Worship may see whether they have done the Company right or not. I doe not remember that did see any other sorts of goods but what is here specified. The wrong Mr Bathurst did the Company in selling their booges for gold, cutting their sletias, have in mine of the 28th October past given your Worship an account of, copie whereof goes here inclosed, as likewise copie of last to England with Mr Winders account etc., whoe (although much against his will, haveing endeavoured his passage upon all ships that has bin her, as well interlopers as Companys ships) comes in the canoe, whome I safely wish with your Worship. What goods he tooke out of the factory in the night time hee has disposed them the major part for gold, and the rest for cloaths, with an intention to have seen England before Cabo Corsoe, although now prevented. I must needs acquaint your Worship that many day's before I arrived here in Captain North that hee had contracted with one Fullwood, an interloper, to have put aboard 40 slaves, and to have went with them himselfe to Barbado's, whereof I am sencible that 8 of them was actually put aboard. Together with Mr Winder comes one Daniell Roe whoe left and ran away from Captain North, whome Mr Winder has entertained ever since; his designe in itt (I am inform'd, if things here went according to his expectation) was in some short time to have sent him away with slaves for New England in a New England man hee expected downe here, of which as bounden thought myselfe obliged to give your Worship an account, leaving the sequell of all things to your Worships prudence. I have likewise sent you up in the canoe one Patrick Welch, whome I understand ran away from the Castle to the prejudice of the Companys interest, hee was brought hither by one Wood, an interloper, and putt aboard of one Wilcocks now in port, whoe turned him here ashoare upon some differance happening.I did hope, as your Worship may perceive by the inclosed copies, might have sent you up the canoe before this, but that the canoemen did evade itt by the non properness of the season of the yeare,<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1162"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1162""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-411"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1162"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>60</sup></a></span> with the like excuses, and have been forced to furnishe them in order to their dispatches as att bottom, of which your Worship may please to take noate. I now question not in the least, but that the Companys affaires here will be in a mighty good posture and condition, and hope towards the maintaining of which your Worship will consider a fresh supply, Mr Winder haveing left nothing behind him that will att present purchase victualls, allthough have and shall ever endeavour the maintaining the Companys, their rights, honour and privilidge here, and the true discharging of those bonds and obligations under which I lay, which hope time may veryfie. As to the removing Captain Wyborne in complyance to your order, I see <span id=""page247"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1163"">pg 247</span></span>not how myselfe or any other in the Companys service can effect it, soe long as the Companys ships doe maintaine and uphold him and supply him with guns, all sorts of ammunition, with other materialls, as Captain Ware has latly don. I have wrote to Mr Thorne severall times but as yett can gett noe account from him of what number of barrs remaine in the factory, although hee writes mee word is willing to goe off and shall, if can gett leave of the King, send Andrew Crosbie thither to take an account and endeavour their disposall for the Companys use. What goods most in demand your Worship will find att foot hereof, for which goods slaves can never be wanting, although there should come downe never soe many ships, and question not but in a verry short time this place may prove of verry great importance to the Company. And if they should altogether quitt Ophra, this place is sufficient for to slave all their ships, for that they doe and must send their slaves from Ophra hither, and that if your Worship and Councill thought itt convenient and approved thereof here might be alway's in bank 100 slaves to supply upon any occasion any of the Companys ships according to your order and directions, which presume your Worship will find itt in time much to the Companys interest.</p>
<p>[PS] May itt please your Worship, there is great occasion of brandy here in the factory.</p>

John Lowe<span class=""br""></span>[Guydah], 10 June 1683</h4>
<p>I am sorry I am forct to give you this sad account of our misfortune att this place, for the 16th of May past about 5 in the evening came down 2 pyrates, the one of 28 guns the other of 24, which ship shee tooke on the coast to windward and man'd out of his ship. The admirall clapt our ship aboard and after fireing many broad sides and valleys of small shott supprized our ship, the slaves on the deck 150 and my caske to cleare my hold. Come with the King's jack, ensigne and pennant, wounded 7 of my men, although they made no resistance. Entered 150 men. My mate cutt the cable, upon which hee cutt his and then laid her aboard upon the luff, att which time my people yeilded the ship. Captain Rickards his people cutt their cable and loosed the fore topsaile and put to the shoare, but before shee came ashoare, quited the ship, tooke out the gold and lett the ship and slaves drive ashoare, the which is lost and not one thing saved out of her. Captain Woollifords men quited their ship and left their gold aboard, the which the pyrates found all the next morning and an English woeman and the cooke. Att this action Captain Rickards, Woolliford and my selfe in the country purchaseing our slaves, which Woolliford might have had his slaves long before but much disobliged the blacks, though hee raised the price of booges att least 10 pounds in a slave, and told the Blacks that I was comeing downe which made them keepe their slaves for mee, which I had 150 aboard and 150 ashoare, but not goods ashoare to pay for them, and I was to be dispatcht in 9 dayes more had this not happened, but now my ship is soe much disabled that I feare shall hardly carry her to the Indias, all my low masts shott, soe that all the fishes and provisions I can make will hardly hould, all but 3 shrouds on one mast and 5 on the other gon, my foremast shott; [they have] taken all my sailes, good provisions, cordage, armes and powder with all my cloaths, gold and what was proper for them as they thought of the Company goods, as allejars, chercolees, pintado's, attlases, muzlin; and what booges on my deck and in my boate to goe ashoare, which was 6 caske, [they] throwes overboard. The next day they seized all my officers to the gunnell to shoote to death to confess for more gold, but only shott my gunners mate to death, and the other which was prevented by the English pyrates that was aboard, otherwise all the rest had dyed. Captain Rickards hath used much dilligence in looking after his gold, which was carried by his men and boate to Ofra aboard the Flemings, but broake open and greate part of itt divided amongst them, and on the news to the Flemings two of them weighed and most of his men gon with them. Hee hath gotten part of it againe and 28 marks sent home to the Company per Captain Woolliford, who sailed 2 dayes since. I have now 423 slaves on board on the Companys account and 25 on my mens account, for when the pyrate had quited the ship and had watered his ship out of her, my men desired him to give them something towards their loss, upon which hee gave them my ship, goods and slaves for their owne proper use, and ordered them that if I agreed to itt they should fire 7 gunns, if not att 8 the next morning hee would come <span id=""page329"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1528"">pg 329</span></span>aboard and burne her, upon which the next morning they demanded my ship, goods and slaves and to gett her to St Thoma and sell her and divide the money. I answered that itt was not in my power to give nor theirs to receive, but if they would goe about their business and refitt the ship I would find out some way to consider their loss, upon which I told them I would gett creditor for 25 slaves and send for the Factor off, whoe should allow itt and give the Company an account, and that I beleeved 25 slaves would make good all their, loss and desired them to consider whether or noe that was not a safer way, then to be like the pyrates, upon which after many disputes they fired 7 guns, and after the man of warr weighed after haveing been here 4 dayes, soe that I sent for Mr Winder aboard and satisfied him of the thing and hee told them hee would assist them with a letter to the Company to that purpose, upon which they went to worke and in 12 day's time I gott my ship in a pretty good condition and went ashoare againe. In which time Captain Woolliford bought all his slaves but how many I cannot tell. His ship was only taken by 3 prisoners which the pyrate sent aboard and brought the White woeman and the cooke and all the gold aboard. Hee saith hee hath lost greate quantity of goods, but I am sure he hath much abused Mr Winder and pretends all that goods that you sent downe to his factory is lost, and had not Captain Rickards and my brother Woolman left him [= Winder] something could not have supported. Hee hath been verry dilligent in getting part of Captain Rickards gold and my slaves, and now recovered of his sickness very serviceable to the Company. The people of this place are verry kind to him and hee obliges them well, but itt is my opinion that if you doe not send for the time forward as many ships to Ophra as this place the Companys trade will be spoyled, for after our loss when wee brought the remaines of goods ashoare the blacks plundered as well as the pyrates and could gett no satisfaction of them, and the people of Ophra att this time doe promise that if you will send ships there wee shall have a good trade, and I well know there the prizes are settled and 20 per cent less then here, for they grow upon every ship here, soe that if you think convenient to lett Mr Winder goe there and order a seacond or more to that factory and 2 or 3 to this, the two places will strive to outvey the one the other. Your advice to us came 12 houres after our ships was taken, and they stayed by the way att a place called Abrew, some 18 leagues to windward of this place, where Captain Wyborne was getting of slaves for Captain Booth,<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1529"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1529""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-540"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1529"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>103</sup></a></span> and that they went on board Captain Booths ship, which gave the pyrate notice that they were a canoe for advice, upon which the pyrate weighed after them and outsailed, otherwise might have had 24 houres notice, for itt was the 17th day of May they came down and your letter of 5 dayes date.</p>

I shall likewise take what care I can to secure the Companys vessell and concerns against all Dutch sloopes and canoes that shall oppose mee, to the best of my power.

<p>Yours of the 20th instant I have received, and had sent James Cunduitt up sooner, but the weather was very bad, and now hee goes in Captain Shepheards boate with him; and have sent John Rattliffe for to looke after Agga factory. Per James Cunduitt I alsoe sent Aprills months accompt with the ballance, being 2 marks, 1 ounce and 10 tacco's, which hope will find right and make noate accordingly; I had sent them sooner but could not gett any safe Conveyance before now. As concerning corne, this day I putt aboard Captain Shepheard 50 chests of corne, att 2 angles per chest, and since his ship is come hither it is risen to 2 angles and 6 tacco's per chest. Indeed corne is very scarce att present and if any more ships come hither I am afraid <span id=""page112"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-616"">pg 112</span></span>itt will raise corne to 3a or 4a per chest. Captain Shepheard God willing this evening intends for Cabo Corsoe, I suppose hee may have gott of the Blacks 15 in 20 chests of corne. I am promised some more corne. I assure your honour I doe what lieth in my power, and would send oftener but am loath to put the Company to 2 angles charge for every letter.</p>
<p>[PS] May please to send per first good conveyance some broad tapsells, lead barrs, sheets, Guyney clouts, large sletias and blew and green perpetuano's. I alsoe want some match, carteridge paper and minion shott.</p>

<p>Yesterday a little after sunsett I arrived at Anamaboe where I found Mr Starland in his paroxisme and very delireous, whereupon I immediatly cupped him and tooke a considerable quantity of blood from his temples, whereupon hee quickly fell asleep and rested all the whole night, this is the third fitt which hee hath had. This morning have given him a doce of physick because hee hath not been purged since hee hath been taken ill, for the chirurgeon of Captain Ambrose only lett him blood and gave him one or two glysters His fitt comes every other day towards evening. I doe intend to draw blisters but if I can possibly be spared from Cabo Corsoe itt will be more proper to apply one 8 or 10 hours before his fitt comes, which I hope in god may prevent itt. If your worship cannot spare mee soe long I will apply them this night and come up according to your first order, although they will not be soe proper.</p>

<p>I have received your worshipps under the 4 instant and returne your worshipp my most humble and hearty thanks for your severall kindnesses, but more especially for the last, and doe asshure your worshipp that I will take all care possible to shew you my gratefullness by doeing nothing that may be against the Royall Company interest, that thereby you shall see that what formerly was guiltie of I am very sorry for, but one thing I humbly beg of your worship (which I am confident your goodness will not denie) that is what reports soever you have of me, that you would be pleased to judge favourablely of me till I can come to justify myselfe, for your worship will perceive by the inclosed note there is one that endeavours to doe mee all the diskindness he can, by faire promises to them that will impeach mee though falsly. I am hearty sorry that I should give your worship the trouble of a second time remembring me of the money I had att Cape Corsoe, but doe asshure your worship I sent per Mr Wendover when he was last with you, but his troubles made him forget to give it you. I have sent it per Peter the canoeman, as also a hee and shee goate with a black boy which I would beg of your worship to accept. The boy is the best I can gett at present, when goe up to Ahenesa shall endeavour to gett you another.</p> <p>This fort is very much out of repaire, one flanker being falen in and two more is proped up, and also severall things wanting which is too long to give an account in writting per this conveyance. If I thought your worship would not take it ill I would come up to Cape Corsoe and acquaint your worship in what a condition the place is in per word of mouth, and also acquaint your worship which way it might be made good at a small charge, to last for severall years whereas now it is repairing every day. If your worship think convenient of my comeing up I can come in the canoe with Mr Wendover.</p>
<p>[PS] One thing I had almost forgot to acquaint your worship with, that is when Mr Nightingalle was here cheife that he ordered me to give the Docter 2o 2ata to goe aboard Doogood to buy wine, which I could not denie. I would not charge itt in the Company account without your worships leave but hope your worship will not let me loose itt, itt not being in my power to withstand his order.</p>

Ralph Hassell<span class=""br""></span>Accra, 17 Nov. 1682</h2>
<p>Since my last of the 16th October per Mr Masters have been silent, which was occasioned through [lack of] matter to correspond on, since which Ahenesa sent downe his son with upwards of 60 people desireing mee to come up to Quomboe to see a great quantity of slaves, sending one son as a pawne for my security, which though your Honour before denied yett thinking itt might prove for my Royall masters interest, I trespased on your Honours commands and went: where I had civill reception and am safe return'd, but old matters were there debated betwixt us, imprimis, why hee did not pay the debts due to the Royall Company contracted by Mr Wendover, to which hee made an answer Wendover owed him 25 bendy's for months custom of the forte, and that besides hee had layne with his wife, which he did expect [payment for?] according to the custome of the country. He demanded of mee custom ever since I was here, to which I responded I had not taken soe much money in my time, and itt was agreed hee should be paid on these conditions, that hee with his people should come downe and trade here att this fort only, and that hee should not hinder any other up country people from comeing downe. I tould him likewise that hee had been 10 months out of his country and that I had not seen <span id=""page194"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-964"">pg 194</span></span>any of his people, and what reason or with what face could hee demand a bendy a month thus. He answers hee was now return'd and would performe whatever hee had promised, provided hee might be supply'd att this fort with such goods as hee wanted, which I answered as far forth as Cape Coast could supply hee should not want if I saw he fail'd not of his word. Then wee proceeded to prizes of goods and slaves, hee demanded a bendy a head for a man and 6 pezos for a woemen. I tould him I would give itt him provided hee would allow mee my prizes for goods, vizt powder 7 pezos a barrell, 5 pezos for say's, 12a for perpettuano's, 3a for brawls, 3a carpetts, 9a fine sletias, 5a course ditto, and other goods to any amount per rates. If your honour thinks meet of this I begg a word of your advice and a supply of those goods I shall now write for per the verry first oppertunity. I have now in the fort 50 slaves and hope if you send a vessell downe with corne with expedition I shall gett more, I now desist for want of corne. I have sold this weeke to Allampo people 13 or 14 barrells of powder for slaves and itt is verry bad powder, or else might have raised itt to 7 pezos, soe begg a supply of good powder, full barrells and well hoopt. I have now sent up my October accompt the ballance whereof is 1m 70z 3a, which finding all things right please to noate itt in conformity. The charges are much by reason of wood, trees and shells, for when a thing is once done well the proverb is tis twice done, and I would not have the same charge to be againe in my life time. I am now about the other halfe of the tower, being breaking stones etc. I humbly begg a supply of goods and necessary's undermentioned.</p>
<p>A box of white beads, some blew beads according to this patern and some biger, 80 tapsells, 40 good say's, 100 blanketts, 100 sletias fine and course, 20 or 30 barrells of powder full, dry and well hoopt in halves, quarters and wholes, 6 chests of sheets or more, some looking glases if any. All these Ahenesa will buy and desired to have them writt for. I humbly begg your Honour to spare if possible 2 hogsheads of tarris for the tank and halfe a sheet of lead for spouts.</p>

<p>Your particular letter per Captain Nurse I received and likewise your generall letter. In your letter your honour admires the hoggs, goates etc. were not sent up. I asked them to doe itt but they refused, haveing noe roome. Alsoe your honour is desireous to heare oftener from hence, which if you please to inspect in former letters you may see that your honour blames mee for too much charge in my accounts, and for that only reason I send noe oftener then you please to order mee, for 8a to carry a letter of noe consequence twice or thrice every month will amount to monys; therefore I humbly begg you not to censure mee negligent. I have now made up my accounts to the 5th instant and have inclosed sent them, per which your honour will see the scarcity of mony and slaves here, which is occasioned by shipps rideing here, for this month has layne one or two ships in sight and this day is a small ship come downe, which will make a bad trade for above this weeke longer here if hee stayes. Captain Nurse will have on board tomorrow if his sloope getts up (as she is in sight) the best part of 300 slaves, as I conjecture by their view.

Most nay all our men have been sick with one distemper or other. John Fishpoole, a souldier, died the 10th of September and Humphrey Davis is excessive ill, soe that now wee have here, now Christmas Cock works [sic], noe more than 2 that stands centinall of whitemen.

<p>Mr Hassell arrived here the 5th instant, and had opposition by the Blacks at his landing, having small shott discharged at him, but is now safe on shoare. I am now sensible there was treachery used by those that ought to have done otherwise in that respect. Mr Wendover brought the sad news of my fathers death, who was my onely friend (my mother being dead before), and therefore I hope God, who is the father of the fatherless, will be pleased to heare my prayers soe fair as to recompence to you all your kindness to me in my sad condition, and I hope I shall never be unworthy of it.</p>
<p>I have been much aflicted with a relapse of my feavour since my last to your Worship but now I hope all is over.</p>
<p>[PS] By reason of my great sickness under which I lay and am yett troubled with, I had never the key of, nor did deliver any thing out of the warehouse, but James Mills in his time [did so?]. Mr Nightingale on a word or two would not signe it. Please to peruse the inclosed etc. Now all things are right and I have noates for all delivered and feare noe mistake etc.</p>

After delays due to ill health. Burrows finally left Anomabu for Egya in May (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-349#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-735"">no.345</a>). Only a single letter from Burrows at Egya survives, in July 1683; but it seems clear, from subsequent references in the Anomabu correspondence (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-371#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-764"">nos 367</a>, <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-372#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-766"">368</a>, <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-377#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-772"">373</a>) that the factory continued to be occupied. The fragmentary character character of the Egya correspondence may mean only that after March 1681 the factory normally reported to the fort at Anomabu, rather than directly to Cape Coast Castle. The Egya factory took some gold, but was probably principally important for the supply of corn to slave-ships. Like Anashan and Anomabu, Egya lay within the state of Fante; hence, early in 1681, the chief of Egya was sent to negotiate with the RAC at Cape Coast by 'the King and Quantrees of Fanteene' (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-384#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-785"">no.379</a>).</p></div>

They have nothing to say to Mr Richards, only that hee had made them pay for that hee had given them before, and for the townes people they say that they had noe hand in the matter, soe this is all the satisfaction that I heare is like to be given by either of them.

<p>You may justly blame me and wonder at my bouldness for goeing to Appa in a canoe that belongs to Captain Wyborne, and also conclued twas on his account and in his service. But I shall endeavour to make you sincible of the contrary, and give you an account of a more honourable a designe than you may or are aware of, and I doubt not may if not neglected prove very advantagious to my masters the Royall Company in whose service I am, and should be heartily glad and as willing as anyone to venture for their advantage my person, as far as my life and health will permitt me, under God etc.</p>

This hard dealing is enough to breake the hearts of any one, and hath been almost the breaking of mine in this case, and doubt not but your thoughts are as mine, for a burnt child dreads the fire. I humbly beg your pardons, Gentlemen. The letter you are all very sincible that twas particularly about my own business, twas to order Mr Ralph Hassell to take the produce of what goods I had to dispose of there, for account of the Company, and although I did not deliver the letter, neither did I on the other hand take the least thing to the vallue of one cracra, but left all as they were. There is neither Mr Hassell nor Mr Pley, nor any one can say I did, soe that hope this may in part give your Worship some satisfaction. I should not have doubted nor have had any feare in mee but would have gladly delivered the letter, but having a knave to deale with all and the blanketts sticking in Mr Hassells throat,<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1121"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1121""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-391"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1121"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>40</sup></a></span> that I could scarce gett a word from him nor a good looke, nor victualls nor drinke, that I did expect no other, butt all the ill usualls imaginable as could be owne to a man, which was the reale cause and is the truth and nothing but the truth (as God shall helpe me). Now being put out of all imployments, and having nothing to doe but walking from place to place and spending my time in idleness, which life was a burthen to me, and being often at Cricry [var. Guidah],<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1122"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1122""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-392"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1122"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>41</sup></a></span> for generally there was the most company, always one Commander or another begging of Captain Wyborne his assistance to furnish them with slaves, for goods and gold, whoe always was ready to imbrace their desires with his promises in great measure, and indeed to speake the truth was commonly as good as his word, being there I made a very neare inquiry into all matters; and understanding that there was a place to leward called Appa from whence he gott a great many slaves, some coming by land others by sea, made me admire that men should see their own goods goeing to this place and bring slaves for the produce, when they might as well themselves send their boats and purchase them themselves, for I believe if a canoe may goe a boat may doe the same (I am sure their ships will not faile them), but they doe soe deale on this place Guidah and Ophra that they thinke slaves are not to be hand past [var. below] these places. Then there is another dependence, Captain Wyborne being there they cannot faile, whoe getting their goods into his hands makes his owne advantage, a benda a head the least price for all sorts, men, women, boys and girles.

<p>Seeing how causes went and nothing to do, I desired the favour of Captain Wyborne that I might goe to Appa per the next canoe, which he readily granted mee, telling me the canoe would returne in 10 days, which time I thought would not be long, and knowing that Mr Smith would not goe this month, I did adventure at which place I am now, of which I shall give you the following account and the great advantage that may be made on all accounts whatsoever. Appa is about 30 or 40 leagues at the most from Guidah and is very remarkable for ships to find, there being a single cocarnutt tree standing in the middle of a small bay, and a flag staff by that one [= on] which they hang up an old clout, itt makes off to sea very woody for it is a woody place, but I shall advise the Phidalgoe to make a new St Georges flagg. The Phidalgoes towne is about 3 miles from the sea, which is incompassed round with water and small riverlett issuing from the great river, and is mightily full of ba[m]boo trees which afford wine much like unto palme wyne, of which baboos they build all their houses. There is also a very famous river that goes to Boneen,<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1125"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1125""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-394"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1125"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>43</sup></a></span> from whence comes all sorts of cloathes and are sold cheap for any sorts of goods. Boneen is 2 dayes journey from this place per land, all goods that comes to this place are conveyed to the Phidalgoes towne by water, they having canoes of 40, 50 and 60 foot in length. There is noe need of anyones taking care of goods when ashoare as to watch them, for the people are so just that they may be trusted with unsold gold, their honesty is to admiration, and the Phidalgoe takes all the care upon himselfe. Here is good conveniency of wooding and watering just by the seaside. These people never goe to sea in their canoes, for the river being soe large and affording very much fish as mullitts and there is one sort of fish that is large as a good handsome hoge, eats much like our sturgeon and is as good in my judgement, for that if any vessell intends for this place they must be provided with a canoe and men, which said canoe may returne fraighted with Boneen cloathes (and other sorts as the place can afford, which may be much to the advantage of the Royall Company my masters. It is also the chiefest markett for slaves (or the fairo as the blacks call it),<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1126"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1126""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-395"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1126"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>44</sup></a></span> from whence the people of Guidah and Ophra are furnisht.

The Phidalgoe is <span id=""page235"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1128"">pg 235</span></span>very desirous of a trade and also the people. Once in 15 or 20 days you shall see the river full of canoes and like unto the River of Thames, some with slaves others with clouts, others with sheap, goats, henns, others with corne etc.</p>
<p>The Phidalgoe is a very good man, and lives in great splendour and much honoured by all his people —  your trade is wholly with him and noe man elce, he takeing charge of all, soe the trouble is but small.</p>
<p>The Cappusheers are a very good honest people, very laborious alwayes, and for the Phidalgoe or else themselves, their business is cheifely in building, which they doe very famously and very large houses, and as for the common people they seldome or never trouble you, for they come not within the Kings Court, but they are generally honest, which thing is a rarity amongst them: tis not soe at Guidah, them knaves are alwayes stealing and bringing troublesome palavoras to their King, which is not here. Goods bringing from the Appraye<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1129"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1129""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-397"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1129"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>46</sup></a></span> very reasonably with abundance of care, and delivered safe into your house. As for the base exacting of custome as the King of Guidah doth demand, I doe not as yett understand that they desire any, and I shall not make enquiry for feare of putting them in mind of such an evill habuit, but I doe believe the Phidalgoe doth expect something, and also the Cabbisheers, which will not be much. I can assure your Worship this that slaves are not wanting at this place, and could the Phidalgoe have any encouragement and his people they would make it their business to turne the trade. Also the people of Assimah or Uper Arda and severall neighbouring Phidalgoes have been with me, and beg heartily that ships may come, for it is soe far for them to go to Guidah, and likewise they run the hazard of being panjard and robed of their goods and slaves (which are all very good reasons in my opinion). And as for the injuries done to the Royall Company, I shall instance in these particulars; Captain Thomas Woodfme, Commander of the Sarah Bonadventure, sold the 3 peices of scarlett cloath to Captain Wyborne for 9 slaves, and also 3 pieces perpettuanoes and 1 piece of say for one, which 3 pieces of scarlett cloath I saw sold for 22 by one Cocarham, a person that belongs to Captain Wyborne, and his [= is] brother to Hansco, a very honest fellow, and very willingly would be imployed in the Companys serice; and also Captain John [Woodfine] of the John Bonadventure and Daniell Gates, Commander of the Allapeen, sold sundry pieces of silks to Captain Wyborne, they being somewhat damaged, which the other person sold as followeth, 1 piece of yellow sarcinett slite and damaged containing 48 yards ¾ for 5 slaves, one piece of green very slite containing 37 yards ½ for 4, one piece of pinke colour and 1 piece cherry containing 37 yards for 5, one piece of skie sarcinett slite but a pleasant colour and good containing 39 yards ¾ for 5, 1 piece of flowered colour and good containing 13[½] yards<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1130"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1130""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-398"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1130"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>47</sup></a></span> for 2 slaves — which goods at Guidah where blowne upon and slited as if they had cost nothing, nay upon the scarlett cloath the King spit upon it, for <span id=""page236"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1131"">pg 236</span></span>noe booges noe slaves, without you will pay the twice the worth of them in other goods. Tis otherwise here, for anything goes off, booges not coveted, but good rich silkes, and all sorts of linnins, noe one sort excepted as I know of unless it be iron barrs, and they shall not stick ahand, neither any other thing rather then not trade, the people are soe willing.</p>
<p>And having now made you sincible of my goeing to Appa and upon what account, which was noe other then to see what manner of place it was and what sort of people, also if that the place were a place for trade or not, which were my cheiefe intentions, and noe other ends in the least but to make the strictest enquiry as possibly I could, that I might be capable of giveing account of a place that may soe much to the advantage of the Royall Company, which is the truth (as God will help me), having given this account I shall leave it to your wise and prudent considerations and shall remaine here untill your further answer and make what inspection possible I can into the trade; and accordingly shall act and doe as you advice.</p>
<p>[PS] I must acquaint your worship that I have had two tedious fitts of sickness since I have been here, which have much weakened me, but I thank God am very well recovered, and in a good way to gaine my strength againe. The Phidalgoe was my docter, for every day he makes me one thing or another to take, but what it was I can never tell, also water to gargal in my mouth, and would alwayes see me take them before he would goe. In perusall of yours by Mr John Smith I understand that Mr Ralph Hassell should say that the oath which I did take upon the account of the blanketts that I was forced to doe the same, but I must be so bold with him as to tell him that he is a base knave and a most horrible notorious lyer, for all the time that I was at Accra last I scarce changed one word with him, for he would not speake to me. And likewise Mr Pley doth confirme the same, he knowes to the contrary, but I pitty him, he dirst doe noe other wayes. For Mr Hassells part tis like him, tis the real effects of his heart and minds, also his maxims of advice to all to deny itt and confirme it with oaths, but I would have Mr Hassell to know that I understand my selfe better then to be made a knight of the past, or to be forced to sweare upon any account whatsoever. He may sweare by the eternall God if that he pleaseth, he never bought any blanketts from Captain John How, and Mr Pley may also sweare he never had them in possession. According to the the oath that I did take, which I did voluntarily, I say that Ralph Hassell Chiefe of Accra did buy from Captain John How 102 blanketts att 3a per blankett, whoe lay at anchor off Lague, this was the 2nd day of October ([16]81), and brought them ashoare and put them into the warehouse in Accra fort;<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1132"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1132""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-399"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1132"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>48</sup></a></span> which is truth as God shall help and the whole truth etc. Being at anchor at Wyamba Captain John How came aboard Captain Thomas Woodfme<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1133"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1133""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-400"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1133"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>49</sup></a></span> and saluted me per the salutation of informer, for Mr Hassell had <span id=""page237"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1134"">pg 237</span></span>acquainted him how squares had gone; and I suppose delivered the blanketts back againe, for he told me that he was fully satisfied.</p>

I saw sold an head of beads of an gold color, transparent, large the size of a white pea, this bought 1 slave. With beads, the small ones, they adorn their cloaths and make capps in the shape of a sugar loaf and adorne them as thicke as possibly they can in sundry pretty formes, which show very glorious.

<p>Heareing of Captain Parris quick dispatch last voyage att Whidda, I encouraged Captain Low to take in his slaves there, and comeing to anchor in the road I was sent on shoare by Captain Lowe and Mr Gouldings order to know how things past as well att Ophra as Whida and in which place I might best and soonest purchase his slaves, and the next day returning on board againe with answer from the King that if Captain Lowe will come himselfe on shoare hee would agree with him for his whole complement of slaves, whereupon Captain Lowe and Mr Goulding went on shoare and the King likeing his cargoe promised him his slaves in 26 dayes, which might have been accomplished had there not come two interlopers into the road, a French man and a Portuguese. Captain Lowe haveing gott goods ashoare Mr Goulding bought slaves att the Kings house att Sabba [var. Saba] and I was ordered at Agriffie the lower towne, but after hee had gott all his slaves, and haveing before promised the King to settle a factory there, hee [= the King] would not lett the goods which were on shoare be carried off, whereupon Captain Lowe and Mr Goulding ordered mee and Robert Chapman to stay with them there, an account of them you will find enclosed herein. Therefore if your worship be pleased to settle <span id=""page224"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1092"">pg 224</span></span>a factory lett mee have your order for itt, that I may make provision for the reception of any ships you shall be pleased to send. I have little to say in the praise of the place, only itt is something more healthfull then Ophra and is a place of free trade for all ships that comes. There is two factory's already, a French and a Portuguese, and interlopers dayley frequent the place. I have done my best to prevent them, to the hazard of my life by one Captain Beacon, who sett a pistole to my breast but I prevented his designe, for the Blacks will have noe striveing one with another but will have all ships trade that comes.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1093"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1093""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-381"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1093"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>30</sup></a></span> Therefore if your worshipp please to continue this place at Whidda itt will require two whitemen, for I have but two with mee, for itt being put to Mr Crosses choyse to goe home or stay he sent for mee to Ophra to take possession of the Companys concerns, the which libberty I could hardly obtaine because of Captain Low's promise to the King, but was forced to come away without anything for my necessaries, neither can I as yet gett the other white man away, though I have made tryall to the loss of all that I brought out of England with mee. If both places be kept itt will be a meanes to dispatch ships the sooner, for there is butt 4 or 5 hours journey betwixt them and you cannot miss of slaves att either place if you send any quantity of booges, and they will be a meanes to put off almost any other sort of goods except iron barrs. A note of what goods is vendible you will find inclosed herein. Wee have great occasion for a canoe or two and some padles. The great canoe was stav'd upon the breakers and the 7 hand canoe broke away from the sterne of Captain Low's ship in a turnadoe, soe that wee have great need of canoes and you had as good send noe ships as noe canoes. For canoemen I have 13 here, and if you send downe any more pray lett them be pawnes, for those which came with Captain Low proved rogues.

Your Honour may be assured I keepe itt not soe slightly as may be by you conjectur'd, but as itt was the Companys money I ought to endeavour the regaining thereof. I have not hindered noe trade thereby, for the Accraa's have noe money to trade withall; and as I wrought all differances are att an end and itt is better to make rogues to comply with foule meanes then by flattery, for being once brought under subjection a yoake seemes not weighty etc. I have according to order sent up the ballance of my last Months accompt being 8m 1o 2a lta per the Ann Sloope, Mr Charles Towgood Commander, and made as quick dispatch for him as possible could.

Nay in verrity shall have noe occasion for any unless have not timber or new carriages, for to my knowledge never this 4 years was any to supply this place and can scarce play a gun on what wee have. This I wright if any occasion should happen, but as long as under your honours command here none shall ere possess but the Royall Company. I have given an accompt to Boby, Ahenesahs sonn, that on the last of this month all goods both little and much damag'd should be sold, and hee promised to bring downe severall men that are considerable traiders with him and give notice thereof to the adjacent country's. I desire your honour that all the articles that were made by your honour (for good disapline and government of men att Cabo Corso vizt for goeing into towne without my knowledge, whoreing and keeping wenches in the fort, swearing etc.) may be sent mee sign'd by your Worship and Councill, which He see performe'd.

Next, considering itt was to one of the Companys ships and was for the benefitt thereof, of the voyage, hee may as well be serviceable in that imploy as if here and if hee goes to England will be thought of not the worse by reason of serving in the ship for the Royall Companys benefitt. And as for the slaves which were delivered Captain Branfill (if you impute itt as a crime) itt being the first time, with humble submission beg your pardon and shall for the future be more cautious.

<p>Your honours dated the 17th instant per Mr John Smith came safe to my hands. As</p>
<p><span id=""page32"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-195"">pg 32</span></span>to an answer of the fire itt is as followeth. On Monday being the 16th instant the fire began about 8 a clock at night about 50 paces to windward from us, which consumed within less than ¾ of an hours time above 200 houses, occasioned by one frieing of fish in palm oyle. The old Queene and Captain Bracon lost all they had, only saved their gold, and as to the Royall Company's concerns att the heate of the fire [I] was afraid that I should not save one cracra worth but the great mercy of God Almighty and assistance of my boys and Commenda people saved all only 1 chest of sheets, 21 lead barrs, 5 31b pewter basons, 28 41b ditto, 85 chests of corne, 10 pewter jugs. The remains [I] have with Mr Smith compared with my accounts and books and found that did agree. The lead barrs, juggs, basons, were in the roome with the iron [and?] are melted, I have saved of itt as much as possible could. The sheets were in my owne room which are consumed with most part of my owne goods. As to the corne [I] had bought and paid for 129 chests, whereof is remayning above 40 odd. I doe assure your honour if such an accident had befallen the Dutch, they would not have saved one penny's worth. The Dutch heareing that our factory was consumed with all the Royall Company's concerns, were very hott to settle their factory, but I have stopt their designe, and what is possible of the contract shall be observed. Here is in the road a great French ship between 30 or 40 guns, about 200 men.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-196"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-196""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-114"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-196"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>32</sup></a></span> I told the Capushers last night to remember your honours contract, and that none here should come ashoare for [I] intend absolutely with Captain Bracons assistance to hinder all them that should act anything prejudiciall to my masters the Royall Affrican Company. Here are likewise in the road two English interlopers, the one called Captain Young the other I doe not know. I desire your honour to send mee your order and Councill if any come ashoare to hinder their designe. I desire your honour be pleased to send some body here to see what is best to be done about the factory, either repairing this or to build where the factory was formerly, and what length and breadth your honour will be pleas'd to order it. I also desire your honour that you would be pleased to consider the loss and charge I am att, also to allow some gratuity to the people that soe trusty assisted mee in saveing the Company's goods, and especially Mr Harper for his care in the midst of the fire, for wee all were afraid the factory would blow up by reason of the powder. If my opinion may be excepted I could advise what is to be done, and att the least charge, about our factory. Soe haveing no more to inlarge only referr the rest to the report of Mr Smith whoe will give your honour a particular account. In the meane time am in a distressed condition as to my person but the Companys goods are secure.</p>

Wee both came ashoare very well and I ordered the canoe to ly off and I would send for the goods. Before Mr Hassell and my selfe was gott up into the factory and satt downe, news was brought us that the canoe was come ashoare and oversett, she is broke all to peeces, her graplin and rope mast and saile [we] have saved.

I sent for the slaves and 40 iron barrs and a bunch of beades, but I haveing neither pen nor paper my mate mistooke and sent a chest of beades. After these goods were ashoare, for when they came first aboard I shewed them all my goods, they would have my powder and musketts, kettles, pintado's, booges, soe I sent for 10 kettles, 10 pintado's, 30 musketts, 1 barrell of powder, 3 plaines. After this they would have all the teeth that I bought of them and wax and severall other small things, and after they had kept mee 24 houres, they lett mee goe. I staid three dayes att the rivers mouth to see if I could gett any Negro's off there, but could not. The 21 st ditto I came to an anchor att Cape Lopas, where I found my brother Lowe, Captain Booth and Captain Howe and a Fleming bound for Angola to take in 500 slaves.

The 25th ditto there came one Captain Serjant that came out of the Bite, and he inform'd mee that Captain Davis was dead and a greate many of his men, and that hee had but 50 slaves in when hee came away. This Serjant is an interloper and was panyard att the Gabboones 9 dayes before mee, and that they made him pay to the vallue of 150 pounds in teeth and goods, before they lett him goe, upon which Captain How and I agreed to goe downe againe to see if I could recover satisfaction. The 26th wee sailed and mett Captain Clarke, but wee put him to a greate deale of charge, for hee tooke us to be the pyrate. Captain Thompson has tooke his passage upon Captain Howe. The 22nd [sic] ditto I came to an anchor att the rivers mouth and went up the river in Captain Howe. The 30th ditto the Prince and about 30 people more came aboard, and after they had been a small time aboard I came in sight and wee panyard the Prince and 8 men more and killed and wounded 10, and the rest leap'd over board. We kept then 6 dayes and I have gott all my owne slaves and part of my goods, but could not possibly gett all by reason of itt's being distributed up in the country, but I have gott 4 slaves and 160 weight of teeth besides my own teeth for the goods and wee lett the Prince and 2 more goe. The 11th of August I came to an anchor att Cape Lopas againe, where I found Captain Lumley's pink, but hee has been dead this 15 dayes. They have a parcell of verry good slaves and has buried but 2 since they came off the coast. The 13th ditto waid againe and the 17th ditto came unto St Thoma, where Captain How and I was clapt in prison under the pretence of our selling goods and not paying the Kings custome, but I understand better since, for they would force Captain Howe to take his provisions of the Governour and Captain and att what price they would, but I was quickly lett out againe, but Captain Howe they made him come to their price. Since I have been here I understand there has been 2 Portugeeze taken at the Gabboones after the same manner as I was, one had 60 slaves and the other 9 and they tooke all from them both and then lett them goe.

<p>Your Honours and Councells much esteemed dated the 6th and 11 of Aprill, allso the 3rd and 7 instant received: wherein I understand your Honours great care and indulgency in ordering me to dispatch Captain Bowler with his complement of slaves. This is to answer that I have done my utmost indeavour and will continue in the same practise. As to our progress at this place, wee have had noe more than 3 slaves, interlopers lyeing here to windward and leward hinders us much.</p>
<p>The Queene being heare as I wrote your honour before hath promised to us some part of her debts, allso pawns for the factory, and to procure slaves, the two first I am certaine but the last I question much to procure as many slaves as wee want. She promise faire but they are blackes, I give them but little beleeve. I doe ashure your honour I will doe my uttmost indeavour. Your honour has been pleased to mention that there was suficient suply of goods sent before, you will find that I will give your honour and Councell a good and just account of what received, sould and remaines when I come to Cape Corsoe.</p>
<p>I shall according to your honours order dispose of noe more goods for gold then will procure slaves. Your honour has been pleased to mention of our progress at Alampa, itt being small incouragement for our Company, and that in all that time I gott but 140 slaves. [I] answer pray consider what ships has been there and the rates they have given, you will finde I have done my indeavour. I am of the same opinion that interlopers will be prevented to come to Guiny by their own imployers when the day of account comes. Your honour has been pleased to mention of the 7 <span id=""page304"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1416"">pg 304</span></span>instant that you dayly expected what success wee had at Wyamba. I have given your honour a full account the same day per our 2 hand canoe, also that Captain Bowler will stay noe longer then 5 dayes after the same date. I have showne your honour and Councells order to Captain Bowler that he should not goe of the coast, with[out?] his slaves or thereabouts, if did it was upon his own account. I doe beleeve ditto Bowler rights to your honour himselfe. He has the 2 letters, one to the Company, the other to Mr Steed and Mr Gascoyne. Being sworne one of your honours Councell to be true to our masters the Company, am bound to follow the same. Your honour will finde per attestation my meaning. I take God Allmighty to wittness I would doe noe man any rong, but instead, would take his place. I give your honour and Councell humble and harty thankes that you have been pleased to lay your commands upon me; there shall be nothing wanting what my meane capassity can procure. If wee stay heere shall want musquetts, but especially tapseeles, and as for giving your honour and Councell a certain account of what slaves to procure in such a time or such a time [I] can not doe itt, when I was heare last with the Portugueese [I?] gott 58 slaves in one months time. Pray lett the rest of the out factorys send what slaves they have.</p>
<p>The sea running here mighty high, the 2 hand canoe could not goe before, nor can I gitt well aboard. In the meane time I doe what I can, gott this day 2 girl slaves, part of the Queens debt.</p></div></div>"

<p>I hearing of Captain Parris quick dispatch last voyage att Whida, encouraged Captain Lowe to take in his slaves there, but after hee had gott his slaves, haveing promised the King to settle a factory there, hee [= the King] would not lett the goods which were on shoare be brought off, whereupon Captain Lowe and Mr Goulding ordered mee and Robert Chapman to stay with them there, an account of which you will find herein inclosed. It being put to Mr Croses choise to goe home or stay, hee sent for mee downe to Ophra to take possession of the Companys concerns, which libberty I could hardly obtaine because of Captain Low's promise to the King, but was forced to come away without my things, neither can I gett the other man away, but think it convenient (with your worshipps order) to keepe both places, for I find them very civill and obledgeing there, and a place as plenty of slaves as this, and are within foure hours journey one of the other, and by keeping both places will be a furtherance of the dispatch of all ships you shall send downe; by which if you send booges a good quantity, with allmost any other goods you have you cannot want slaves, for they are very plenty. I humbly begg of your worshipp to send downe a man or two, and one in the roome of James Boyde, for hee has been very falce to Mr Cross, and promised the Blacks 12 slaves in goods, if they would send him [= Cross] away, and make the other cheife, so that hee might have the command of the factory, to imbazle thee Company's goods as he pleased, but some of the Blacks <span id=""page222"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1088"">pg 222</span></span>haveing a kindness for Mr Cross came and told him of itt, whereby itt was prevented, this is the greatest occasion of his [= Cross's] goeing home now as hee himselfe has told mee, and as far as I understand this rogue has the same designe upon mee, for I have heard some inclining of itt, and am sencible by the very same craft this factory has often been ruinated, and the Company not only lost their goods, but a great many honest men their lives, therefore I hope you will be pleased to take itt into consideration. Wee have great occasion for a canoe or two, and some paddles, the great canoe was staved upon the breakers, and a 7 hand canoe which was here was broken adrift in a turnadoe, soe that at present wee have great want of canoes, and you had as good send noe ships as noe canoes, for without them nothing can be done. Pray send some booges by the next shipping, and they will put off any goods you shall send downe besides, without them you must expect little to be done, for tis all one their money here, as silver and gold is wth us.</p>

Hee likewise desired mee to write for sayes, sletias, course and fine, sheets and halfe barrels of powder, per reason whole barrels are too great a weight to carry soe far in the country, alsoe for currell if any att Cabo Corsoe. These are all that was desired, soe hope your honour will supply mee per Satureday next, att which time I expect the same persons againe, alsoe would desire your advice if convenient for my journey. I am willing to adventure for my masters interest any where, haveing been there formerly and had a kind reception. I have finished one flanker and another the beames are laid, and alsoe am now a breaking of stones to finish itt and soe goe on with what speede possible with the other works. Lyme is the only thing wanting and here is shells enough att the waterside about 5 leagues off to serve our turns if could but gett them here. Mr Shears hath severall times fetcht from thence, soe he knows the place verry well. Also [we need] a couple of good beams about 15 or 16 foot long for the tower, about 9 or 10 inches square. In my last I advised your honour that the wedges, maule and irons were lost, if slaves comes I shall want irons for have not above 10 paire that are good, soe a supply of all these are needfull. I shall from time to time render your honour advice as occasion shall proffer.</p>

<p>Although I have informed your Worship of my proceeding by Mr Shears, yet thought itt convenient to give your Worship an account of itt myselfe in wrighting, for since my departure from Cabo Corsoe I have taken about 12 ounces of gold, most of which has been for sheets, of which I have only 40 remaining, haveing sold only 7 perpettuanoes and ½ a barrell of powder, although I lay 2 dayes between Shuma and Commenda, and one day att Shumah, the rest of the time I have layne here. Here lyes att present att this place 2 interlopers, the one Captain How and the other Captain Price in Finchams Catt, the latter of which came yesterday, but I beleeve neither of them has taken any money since they came here, for I have not seen one canoe goe aboard of them. Yesterday by a canoe that came from windward I was inform'd that there was a Companys ship att Dickiscove that would be downe about 4 or 5 dayes but the Commanders name I cannot informe my selfe of. The same canoe told mee that Ashenee was all destroyed by the up country people about 10 or 12 dayes since.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1344"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1344""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-486"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1344"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>49</sup></a></span></p>

As to Aga palavera they would not lett John Ratclifte have any thing to eat or drinke there for this 2 dayes, and last night they sent Arda Jack and his wife hither, I left them to helpe John Ratclifte there, and this morning John Ratclifte hath been heere to fetch his chest and other things there, soe they lett him take his things but would not lett him take the key of the doore, soe I bid him take an account of the benches and windows that was there etc., and when he asked for the key they thrust him away and bid him begon. I sent them word last night if any bench etc. was missing, one day will come when they must pay for it.

<p>This is to acquaint your Worship that last night the towne of Succondee was sett on fire in three severall places, by whome wee know not. The Cabasheers houses are all bur[n]t and if care had not been taken by the said Cabasheers our factory would have been bur[n]t too, but I thank God wee escaped the same and soe did the Dutch whoe escaped verry narrowly, one of the houses was blowne up with powder, haveing in one halfe barrell which burnt six severall people which I feare will not live. Here is a greate many Wassa's in towne which hath given mee in hand 9 marks of gold for powder att 6 pease per barrell which if your Worship can possibly supply them, they will take itt off my hands from the waterside and carry itt up to Wassa country least itt should come to any damage in the towne. Here the Dutch are lett alone in their wayes, noe body doth molest them, they sell abundance of beades and sheets alsoe ginghams and a few perpetuano's. If I had a better house on the top of the hill, where I could be out of danger of any fire and had a quantity of each sort of goods I should make a good hand of itt. The Dutch sells his sayes att 1 ounce, the Negro's loves their sayes better then ours, they esteeme their collour better. I am in want of green Welch plaines, perpetuano's, sheets (blew Welch plaines are noe commodity here, I have a parcell of them but will not sell). I have not yett had any news from the Addoomes, here is one of the said people in towne whoe informes mee that foure dayes hence Tickadoe will send downe one of his Cabasheers heither. As concerning Mr Scheffer I have noe answer as yett. Had not this fire happened last night I would have sent my accompts to your Worship according to your Worships order, but now I am takeing care to gett the thatch to cover the house againe which was taken downe last night for feare of the fire. As soone as itt is finished Coffee shall come downe with the said accompts and the gold.</p></div></div>"

<p>Your honours of the 27th instant I have received. The 100 pieces perpetuano's and 40 pieces sayes, with the 6 gallons brandy for the factory's use are all come safe to Captain Bracons hands. I have sent you per bearer for account of the Royall Company 4 marks, 5 ounces, and 8 angles, which is the just sume of the 60 perpettuanoes last received amounts to. The perpetuanoes this day received will immediatly be sold, wherefore Captain Bracon desires your honour would be pleased to send him more for account of the Royall Company 100 pieces blew and green perpetuano's with the 10 barrells powder last writt for with its price. Hee desires likewise if itt may please your Honour to lett him have 50 pieces of the now writt for perpetuanoes at 9a per piece, which hee intends to send up in the country upon his own account soe that hee may gett some profitt by them for himselfe. I see but little probability for building the factory this season, for the blacks sayes plainely they will not undertake such a building except your honour send people up to build itt, as alsoe the raines will goe neare to be a greate hinderance to itt. Captain Bracon humbly desires you would cause Oliver the blacksmith to make him a grapline of two iron barrs for a 9 hand canoe, the barrs hee desires may be placed to his account.</p>

I went to windward and that night gott to Shumah, where Captain Coffee found mee at 4 a clock this morning, haveing been under saile an houre before, and your Worship ordering mee to send word immediatly I have therefore sent my canoe downe to Commenda (with this letter) to desire Captain Brackon to forward itt by land by one of his boy's, and I would desire your Worship that you would be pleased to send two or three words to Commenda to meet mee there when I come downe, that I may know what I may doe, for if once the say's were gon, which hope I shall put off to windward, I doe not question the sale of the rest.

<p>Yours of the 15th instant I have received per the 5 hand canoe, with 3 whitemen, vizt Robert Crow, John Younger and George Browne. You seeme to be much concerned why wee have noe greater trade. I have given severall reasons in formers, as here being soe many forts soe neare that itt spoyles the trade, and that soe many interlopers comeing downe dayly to Tishee 3 leagues to leward, which causes soe great a resort of up country people to flock thither that in a manner all the forts are voyde of trade, for there they goe and noe one mollests them; but if here were good store of sletias and sheets they would vend suddainely. And as to what you write [that] you have not received above 12 or 13 marks in 16 months time, if you please to inspect a little farther you will find 16m 3o 15a 4ta paid, which indeed is a verry inconsiderable sume for the time, I wish cinceerly itt could have been 100 fold more, that then some creditt might redound to mee and not allways receive cheques and ill resentments. And as to what your honour blames mee in not sending Mr Windovers goods up I askt Mr Towgood to take them in, whoe told mee hee was soe full hee could not unless they were to put upon the spindle of his vaine.

<p>Your honours dated the 21st instant came safe to my hands. [I] am glad to heare</p>
<p><span id=""page34"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-206"">pg 34</span></span>that your honour has been pleased to consider that I have done my endeavour as to the saveing the Royall Company's marchandise from burning and other damage. Itt was noe more but my duty, but doe assure your honour itt was difficult, but hope by the blessing of god almighty never to see such an accident att Commenda againe. Your honour has been pleased to command my small opinion about rebuilding the Royall Companys factory, which is as followeth. Att the first place in my opinion itt will be more profittable and secure for the Company to rebuild the factory where itt was formerly or there about, by reason itt is the only place to build a fort at, it being higher ground then any place att Commenda; alsoe [it is] the Royall Company's owne ground, itt is to windward of all the towne, to prevent fire, in short a small fort being built can command both sea and land. Secondly am advised by Captain Bracon and others here, that if your honour dus not resolve to sett both the people of Great and Small Commenda very speedily about building the old factory, that the raines will goe neare to prevent the finishing of itt, for I count but 3 months till the raines comes in. In the interim the people are willing to give mee their assistance in rebuilding this house for the security of the Companys goods and interest untill the other be built, and that att as little charge as may be. Therefore my desire is your honour will be pleased to keepe a good and faire corespondence with the King of Commenda and the people here soe that they and I may know your honours orders and designes, for I am confident they will doe what lies in their power for our advantages and assistance, both in the rebuilding and tradeing, as yesterday I have found, for haveing according to your honours orders notice of their tradeing with the French and other ships I sent my complaint to the King, whoe immediatly sent for the people of this place up to Aguaffo, whoe are not yett return'd but [I] have had advice from thence that the King made them take the fittish not to buy any goods aboard of ships provided wee had them in the factory or could procure them in 15 dayes time. Whatever your honour is pleased to conclude on for the rebuilding I desire your honour will send a fitt person who may survey the charge the Company will be att either for building or rebuilding, as likewise to contrive what may be done and att the least charge and best convenience for the Royall Companys interest, that in this case I may be blameless for any extravagancies of charge, for I am resolv'd not to extend the limitts of your honours order. As touching the French I have noe other information then what I have writt formerly, only that Monsieur Ducas comes Generall<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-207"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-207""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-121"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-207"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>39</sup></a></span> with two men of warr of 45 gunns apeece, and one small frigat and two sloopes to settle upon this coast.

Per the bills of ladeing and the account, your Honour will perceive how many received on bord at all places, out of which are deceased in all 19, vizt 8 males and 11 females, of which number 6 were received from Cape Coast Castle, and 1 from Accra. In the account your Honour will find to be short in the tapseels 11 pieces, I doe sweare I saw noe more, not 1 piece than specified in the account, and beleive that they came not on bord. I wish Mr Bridge had taken receipt (as the usuall manner is) for the goods so put on board, then the error would have been manifested with ease, of the sort of goods many came loose on bord, all the other answering the invoice, except the afore menconed tapseels. Your Honour etc. may perceive by the severall letters sent you that slaves were not easily purchased where we have been, and truly I am glad we have so many on bord, which had not been purchased had not Mr Nightingale been acquainted with the coast and likewise industrious in this affair.</p>

Mr Thorne hath made up his accounts to the 18th instant, when he delivered the keys of the trunk into my possession, I being detained here by the Phidalgoe, who is very sorry that the Royall Company should have any thoughts of settling at another place, this having been the residence for their people this many years, soe will not lett me leave it, but hopes the Royall Company will alter their resolution and continue their trade with him.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1111"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1111""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-388"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1111"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>37</sup></a></span> My humble advice is that goods may be speedily sent down, with a factor to remaine as second to me, and that both this place and Guidah be continued, the one under the other. By examination I find that Mr Thomas Goulding died about the begining of May last. Mr Thorne being then at Guidah, he declares he knows nothing of his concernes, Mr Cross having taken Mr Gouldings estate into his hands, which was left him as I understand by his last will. Captain John Woodfme is ready to saile, of whome I have demanded bills of loading for his slaves, but he possitively denies to give any, having bought his Negroes himselfe. Captain Thomas Woodfme continues still at Guidah, in great distress for want of goods to purchase his complement of slaves. He hath severall times sent his boat to this place to offer gold for Negroes, the Dutchman have sent him some <span id=""page230"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1112"">pg 230</span></span>and promises more, but at a very extravagant rate. I received your letter of the 24th February last per Captain Daniell Gates, who arrived at Guidah the 20th instant, I shall comply with your orders in demanding bills of loading for his slaves, when he hath his complement, and proceed further as your letter directs. If he comes hither I shall doe my utmost endeavour for his dispatch, otherwise I shall be incapable of doeing him any service. Mr Smith has taken charge of the hogshead brandy sent from Capo Corsoe with me, which he will give an account of at his returne. I shall att all times endeavour to promote the interest of my masters, and doe hope that you will think fitt to send downe supplies, that I may have encouragement in their service.</p>

<p>According to that inviolable duty I am ever bound to beare you for your great and repeated favours to mee, I humbly presume to acquaint your worshipp with the transactions here, for the blacks, both Ahenesa's people and of the Dutch and Portuguese Towne and of other countries, came this morning in a kind of a mutinous manner, upon the reporte Bonete the black that came downe from Capo Corsoe gave them, that Mr Nightingale was to depart this place and Mr Hassell to come Chiefe. The Capisheers in generall declared upon their fetish that they would sooner die every man than admitt Mr Hassell to come on shoare, but would with their musketts with their whole force resist him to the utmost, and that if he did come on shoare, the fort should be forever in danger of treachery and never 1 oz[?] of trade should be admitted, for they all declared they loved Mr Nightingalle and <span id=""page172"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-883"">pg 172</span></span>would venture their lives for him and bring him a good trade, but as for Mr Hassell they had not forgott their wives, children and friends that was carried away in his time, and that hee should never have one months peace here. I doe assure your worshipp from the bottom of my heart I doe not write this out of any feare from, or persuasions of Mr Nightingalle but purely out of duty and commands your worshipp hath been pleased to give mee to inform you of all transactions of moment, and leave itt to your worshipps pleasure, not doubting but you will please to confide in my fidellity both in this and my former letter (being not without sufficient witness in both), for I thank God I never did, and will imbrace the maxime that honesty is the best pollicy, and doubt not after your worshpp hath been pleased to putt mee right in the abuses put upon me per Mr Frankland as to the pottkeys etc. you shall find your favours not plact amiss, paying humble thanks I ought, for here I live here without expence in the least at the chiefs table, which most heartyly from the bottom of my soule thank your worshipp for, since I could not doe itt att Capo Corsoe. And I most earnestly (on that consideration) begg your worshipp to continue mee here, and if I in the least doe amiss either to the Royall Company or your worshipp I doe not desire the least favour as unworthy of soe much goodness.</p>
<p>I doe not put the Company to the charge of this canoe, for the Cabosheers send it with one of them in it to make a pallavre with your worshipp concerning the promises. I begg your worshipp not to take this amiss, being done out of pure duty (being their very words), and not for any other end. As soone as I receive any quarters sallary I will returne your worshipp the 17a I am indebted to the Steward. I begg pardone for my bad writting, the canoe being just goeing.</p>

Accra was important for trade in both gold and slaves.</p>
<p>Accra had been conquered by the hinterland power of Akwamu ('Quomboe', 'Comboe' in these documents) in 1680.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-822"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-822""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-280"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-822"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>3</sup></a></span> The king of Akwamu, Ansa Sasraku ('Ahenesa', 'Ahenesah') figures prominently in these letters. Early in 1681, there were apprehensions that Ansa might launch a further attack on Accra, including the European forts there (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-412#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-864"">nos 405–6</a>).

The Accra correspondence provides important information on Ansa's continuing conquests thereafter, including a war against Akyem ('Achim', 'Akim') early in 1682 (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-430#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-914"">nos 423</a>, <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-432#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-920"">425</a>); the conquest of Tafo ('Taffo') in the interior in 1682 (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-432#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-920"">no.425</a>); a victory against Kwaman ('Coma', 'Commong') in 1682 (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-438#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-937"">nos 431</a>, <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-442#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-952"">435</a>); and campaigns against the Adangme ('Allampo'), east of Accra, in both 1682 (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-438#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-937"">no.431</a>) and 1683 (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-458#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-988"">nos 451–2</a>).</p>
<p>The hinterland merchants who had previously traded to Accra are named as the Akani ('Arcanies') and the Akyems ('Ackims') (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-432#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-920"">nos 425</a>, <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-465#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1010"">458</a>). However, it is made clear in this correspondence that the Akwamu conquest had had the effect of cutting off these hinterland traders from free access to the coast, King Ansa seeking to interpose himself as a monopolizing middleman, to the great detriment of the trade.</p></div>

<p>Yours under the 31 May past received per Mr Wendover, and take notice what you write as to shewing my letter to the Agent, for which and all other kindnesses I give you many hearty thanks. I received a letter from the Agent per said Mr Wendover and desire you to doe mee the kindness to give my hearty thanks for his kindness and asshure him that for the future I will not be guiltie of the like misdemeanor and shall be shure to observe his command in all things, and also further acquaint him that I made a further inquiry after what I write you in my last touching the bearer hereof Mr Nightingalle, and that I find that hee gave for a watch to Mr Harvey 1 man slave and to one Turner, a Dutch interloper, a boy for a caske of wine. He also told mee that hee gave for women slaves at Allampo 4 tapsells, 1 sheet, which is good [for] 1 bendie, 1 angle and a halfe, for a tapsell is never sold under 6 angles at Allampa, and at the same time the Dutch bought for 5 pease. There was also the other day in the roade one Doegood, an interloper, who sent his mate ashoare to him to know what hee wanted. He treated the mate very civilly and sent the docter off with him to buy a quarter cask of wine, which he did. I should have writ this to the Agent himselfe had I had another conveyance, but he carrying it himselfe [I] fear'd least he should suspect the truth and not deliver it. Pray give my service to Mr Spurvay, Mr Stapleton Captain Phipps and the rest of the Gentlemen with you and tell Captain Phipps I will write to him per Mr Wendover, and answer his desire.</p>
<p>[PS] I have sent you by the bearer a boy. He is not so handsome as I could wish he were but is the best I could gett, therefor hope you will accept the will for the deede.</p>

<p>Whereas Mr John Winder, your honours cheife factor for this coast, was upon the 15th of this instant September panyard by the Blacks in order to his being sent home <span id=""page238"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1139"">pg 238</span></span>in the ship Thomas and William, the reasons whereof shall in short give your honours and thereby endeavour to cleare myself of those aspertions hee already has or may further cast upon mee.</p>
<p>Firstly: Att his first comeing here from Ophra to this place, not well considering the interest of your Honours in studying and consulting the humours and dispositions of these people, whoe will neither be slighted by a high and lofty carridge or abused by bad language, in both of which gave too much liberty to his selfe, by which hee hath for ever lost the love and good will of these people, although the breach for the present be seemingly made up, there being not one upon the place from the King to the poorest can afford or give him a good word.</p>

For some time past your honours factory here lead voy'd, in which time did give the utmost of my assistance to all masters of ships in your Honours service, by which meanes was gratified by one and the other to the vallue of 7 or 8 bendy's, possibly more, 7 whereof lent to Mr Winder, for which received his noate to be paid mee againe, but some time after when hee had my money in possession told mee hee had seazed itt for your Honours account, which seemed more then unkind, of which doe leave your honours judge. Seeing hee was like to leave the place [I] did tell him if might have my monyes [I] would trye and endeavour to compose his business, which did endeavour and partly by my meanes itt was effected, and to what other callamnys hee may loade mee with, as seeing interlopers and the like, I doe here declare the contrary, but can bring with good proofe the same thing upon himselfe, which hereunder in short shall give your Honours an account of in three articles.</p>
<p>1st. Upon the 14th day of August past, here being in port an interloper called [blank], one Fullwood Commander, whoe wanting some assistance, Captain Wyborne not being here, Mr Winder did him what kindness lay in his power, by first of all in paying his customes to the King, which was paid out of your Honours warehouse in 9 lb of boogees and 9 yards of silke, which contracted the familliarity betwixt them (things not here going to his satisfaction), that hee agreed to put 40 slaves on board of him and soe leave your honours factory here, 8 of which was put on board, in which time Captain North came in hither with some goods for your honours account [and] the business was made up and declined.</p>
<p>2ndly. Captain Shepheard here leaveing some few remaines of booges, the said <span id=""page239"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1141"">pg 239</span></span>Mr Winder caused them to be carryed to Captain Wyborns to serve and for the use of interlopers.</p>
<p>3rdly. Upon the 17th instant I doe know and can attest hee served and supplyed a Portugueze vessell with 6 slaves, notwithstanding your honours ship in port, which is all att present I shall trouble your honours with, notwithstanding could attest and averr severall things more.</p>

This morning is gon by to Cormanteene a greate canoe loaden with goods and the Blacks saith the Dutch sayes are of a better dye then ours. If [sic] my opinion is that if the green perpetuano's were lowered to 9 angles, they would goe off and helpe to putt off our sayes and wee might bauke the Dutch, and itt would be better then they should lye for the cockroaches and moaths to eate them, they being a commodity that will not goe off att present.

In your honours last you ordered mee to send up my accounts with the ballance, I have made them up to the 5th instant, and what comes between this and then shall be transported to the next account. The ballance of the last account there is due 10oz 15a and odd tacco's, which I have not sent (for which begg your excuse) by reason that 12 day's hence is pay day and then must pay 11 oz and odd. If trade comes not I know not how men can live, for every thing of provisions is soe excessive deare that scarce a little corne but by the taccoe can be had heare. Most of all our people has been sick; Humphry Davis is now soe weake that I know not whether ever hee may recover.

<p>Our oppinion in itt is that itt will very much advance the Companys interest, by the great quantity of slaves that is to be had from that place, and the great awe to Ophra, who att present slites our English factory and nation and dus not allow halfe the libberty to us as to the Dutch, provided that that factory be accountable to <span id=""page308"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1429"">pg 308</span></span>Ophra (and dependant upon that), besides the better convenience for getting of water for shipping and not above 6 leagues from Ophra.</p>

Hee would willingly have gon off in Captain Ambrose or Captain Ware, but neither of them would receive him, itt being our generall advice that hee should apply himself to your Worship and Councill, causing the goods hee carried out of the factory in the night time to be brought in againe, which hee will not be perswaded to, but supose hee will take the next oppertunity to goe off. Shall endeavour as much as in mee ly's to maintaine the Companys honour and interest, although hee has left mee very little to doe it with, as your Worship will perceive, and in goods that will not readily vend. This comes via St Thoma per Captain Ware, whoe has this day gott his complement of Negroes aboard if not more, haveing left behinde him only 21 iron barrs in the factory. I have obeyed your Worships order in requiring bills of loading from them, but itt is refus'd by all. To prevent the Companys goods from being made use of I doe humbly offer my opinion that your Worship send down copie of their invoyces of what goods aboard of them for the purchaseing their complement of Negro's, by which shall be able to make some computation; for that if they have any remains they will rather sell them for gold then leave them in the factory for the Companys use, as Mr Bathurst in Captain North did, whoe sold upwards of 500weight of booges, cutt the Companys sletias, sold severall remnants amounting to 11 peeces to Mr Winder, whoe will not denie itt, by which the trade is almost ruin'd. In 2 or 3 days hope shall dispatch the canoe, by which shall give your Worship a more large account how things goe here. In the meanetime humbly crave further orders for the settleing of this place, which in time may prove a place of as great consequence as any place upon the coast of Guyney. Doe likewise crave positive orders for the putting of any slaves aboard any ship or ships, and the quantity.</p>

I have obeyed your orders in delivering an account to Mr John Winder of all the Royall Company concerns that have been in my charge, copies whereof I have sent to Capo Corsoe, and have always endeavoured to give advice of affaires here as well to the Agent and Councill as to my masters in England. I am sure I have been at great charge and have lost considerably since I came downe last, by sollicitous dilligence in the Royall Company service, however I see my honest endeavors have been ill represented or not well accepted. When I was ordered from Whidah to Ophrah by Mr Cross I lost the greatest part of my things to the vallue of 14 slaves, they being seized on by the King of Whidah, for noe other reason then my leaving his country, for the service of the Royall Company. I hope some consideration may be allowed for it, otherwise people will have little encouragement to serve the Company. I likewise paid 2 slaves for a flag and staff, which never was put in my account. I am heartily sorry I am turned out of my imployment without any reason given. I will obey your order as soone as possible I can, which cannot be until the ballance of my account is sent downe which I owe to the Blacks of this towne, having borrowed it out of necessity. I much admire I could receive noe answer of my letters and accounts which I understand were received at Capo Corso. It would have been a great satisfaction if I could receive your approvall of my accounts, or otherwise what you could object against them. Here is likewise 21 slaves due for building the house which must be paid before I can goe off, having engaged to the blacks before they would undertake to <span id=""page229"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1108"">pg 229</span></span>build.

<p>My last to your honour was the 24th March, wherein I desired of your honour more recrutt of goods by reason sayes, perpettuanes, Ginny stuffs, Welch plaines, knives doe not goe of for slaves, and the Dutch shipp lying heare with good cowries, long cloth, fine sletias, bright musquetts, also gives a great rate for slaves, putts me to a stand, also is heare 2 English interlopers which gives 2 ounces of gold for a slave.

<p>The Negroes promises faire, but currant goods purchases slaves, which are broad tapseeles, long clothes white, sheets, brawles, fine sletias, broad nicanneese, allejares, read ground pintadoes, bright musquetts, but especally cowries.

<p>Your honour is not unsensable how far wee have gott in the 20 dayes of demorage after the 64 according to charter party, therefore pray lett me have your Honours and Councills order if you thinke it convenient for Captain Bowler to stay longer upon the coast then the 20 dayes.

<p>My small oppinion is this, that if your honour keepe the shipp longer then the 20 dayes, and send some of the goods afore mentioned, especially broad tapseeles and some other of those which are in the Castle, I doe beleeve by degreese and good industry wee may gitt the ships complement of slaves or there about, in 6 weekes time.</p>

<div class=""div2 editorial prelim""><a name=""actrade-9780197261767-div2-483""></a><p>The section of the West African coast east of the River Volta was probably already becoming known to Europeans by the 1680s as the 'Slave Coast'.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1052"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1052""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-353"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1052"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>1</sup></a></span> The RAC correspondence, however, does not employ this terminology, calling it rather the 'Coast of Arda', after Allada ('Arda'), the principal African state in the region. The RAC had re-established a factory at Offra ('Ophra') in Allada in 1674,<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1053"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1053""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-354"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1053"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>2</sup></a></span> and this still existed at the beginning of 1681. In May 1681, an attempt was made to establish a second factory in the neighbouring kingdom of Whydah ('Whiddaw', 'Guydah' etc.), to the west; but this proved abortive, the RAC factor left there, John Thorne, being recalled to take over the factory at Offra in August of the same year. At the beginning of 1682, the RAC again sent people to occupy Whydah, but the chief factor designated for Whydah, John Winder, initially took up residence at Offra, and moved to Whydah only in July 1682. At the time of the latest correspondence preserved, in June 1683, both the Whydah and Offra factories were maintained, although the possibility of withdrawing the latter was under discussion. It was, however, evidently abandoned soon after. The trade at Offra and Whydah was solely for slaves; gold was available only as a re-export, being brought by some European traders from the Gold Coast to be exchanged locally for slaves.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1054"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1054""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-355"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1054"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>
<p>The correspondence from the Offra and Whydah factories is not preserved as completely as that from the establishments on the Gold Coast. In part, this reflects their greater distance from Cape Coast Castle, and the lesser frequency of communication with the latter. Ships which had once left the Gold Coast to the eastward did not normally pass back up along the coast. Offra and Whydah depended for their communication with the Gold Coast mainly on African canoes and canoemen, which were regularly brought from the Gold Coast by European ships for use further east and returned home when their employment was completed;<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1055"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1055""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-356"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1055"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>4</sup></a></span> alterna-<span id=""page217"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1056"">pg 217</span></span>tively, letters were carried by ships departing from the coast to the island of São Tomé, where they were evidently passed on to local shipping for transmission to the Gold Coast. In addition (and partly in consequence of this pattern of shipping and communication), it seems that the Slave Coast factories for most purposes reported directly to the RAC in England, rather than through Cape Coast Castle.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1057"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1057""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-357"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1057"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>5</sup></a></span> The correspondence from Whydah reproduced here, indeed, includes some letters sent to the Company in London, which were copied for information to Cape Coast.</p>
<p>In addition to the RAC's factory in Offra, the Dutch West India Company also maintained a factory there, which is mentioned in several of these letters. When the RAC began to consider a factory in Whydah in 1681, it was noted that there were already a French and a Portuguese factory there (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-487#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1091"">no.479</a>). The French factory here had been established in 1671. <span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1058"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1058""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-358"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1058"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>6</sup></a></span> The Portuguese factory may have been established in 1680;<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1059"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1059""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-359"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1059"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>7</sup></a></span> it was evidently ephemeral, however, since in November 1682 it was reported to be empty, there being no Portuguese in Whydah.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1060"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1060""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-360"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1060"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>8</sup></a></span> At Whydah, as reported in this correspondence (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-487#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1091"">no.479</a>), the RAC had been preceded by a rival English factory, established by the interloper Petley Wyburne in November 1681.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1061"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1061""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-361"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1061"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>9</sup></a></span> Three of the letters preserved in this correspondence were from Wyburne, rather than the Company's own factors. The RAC evidently demanded that Wyburne should withdraw, but Wyburne himself refused to leave (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-499#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1168"">nos 491</a>, <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-503#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1203"">495</a>), and the RAC's own factor claimed to be powerless to remove him (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-498#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1160"">no.490</a>). He was still there, trading in competition with the RAC, at the end of 1683.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1062"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1062""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-362"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1062"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>
<p>The RAC correspondence for 1681–3 is less illuminating about the indigenous politics which formed the background to (and, in some measure, a determinant of) the patterns of European activity on the Slave Coast. Other evidence shows that, when the Company began trading at Whydah in 1681, the Governor of Offra had initially forbidden the carriage of slaves there;<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1063"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1063""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-363"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1063"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>11</sup></a></span> but by the time of the first letter in the series reproduced here, in May 1681, 'free trade' between the two places had been re-established (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-484#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1067"">no.476</a>). Subsequently, in December 1681, there is reference <span id=""page218"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1064"">pg 218</span></span> to a war 'among the Blacks', which evidently involved a threat of attack on Offra, since the English factory there had to purchase gunpowder for its own defence, and to a subsequent meeting of repesentatives of the kings of Allada and Whydah to make peace with Offra (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-488#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1097"">no.480</a>, with inclosure 1); but the context and significance of these events is not explained. Other evidence shows that the rivalry between Offra and Whydah for control of the European trade was complicated by tensions between Allada and Offra, with Whydah recurrently supporting the latter in rebellion against the former,<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1065"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1065""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-364"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1065"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>12</sup></a></span> so that the threat to Offra in 1681 may well have come from Allada rather than from Whydah. In the following year Allada was reportedly urging the RAC to establish a new factory, at Apa to the east, on the grounds that the route to Whydah was unsafe, traders running the risk of being 'panjard [kidnapped] and robed' on their way there, very probably (though this is not stated) by the people of Offra (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-492#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1117"">no.484</a>). This implies both that Allada was then sending its trade to Whydah rather than Offra, and that its policy was to establish access to the coast independently of Offra, rather than to favour the latter.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1066"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1066""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-365"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1066"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>13</sup></a></span></p></div>

He would not give me any acccount of every particular mans concerns but said all are the Companyes, which Mr Wendover can give your Honour ample sattisfaction therein. I question not but he has been the hearauld of his owne actions and has sufficiently emblazoned his heroick deeds, thinking noe man able to agitate as he hath donn; but my halfe of this month will demonstrate I have past him, for I have nigh 12m of gold and 12 slaves, and what goods that are vendable for the purchasing more which I will here insert. As for the worthy gentleman Mr Mills, who did before my arrivall upon somewhat of a word given him per Mr Pley, waite for him on purpose to shoote him with 4 bulletts in his peece, and swore if he came downe would be his death.</p>
<p>What I have desired your Honour on the other side I humble begg you will send, for I cannot buy any more slaves till I have corne. I need not mencion what goods, but must submitt and say what you please to spare. I have not a good say nor perpettuanoe, nor sheet, sletia, brandy. Allejars are much in quest for slaves, soe is all goods. This is the needfull at present, with all the paper inke and wax I have [sic], soe hope a speedy supply.

Captain Bracon with the rest of the merchants of this place returned from Aguaffoe upon Wednesday night, by whome I understand the King hath given free leave to the three Cheife of the Arcanies to goe aboard ship and trade, which is a great signe of the little regard the King carry's to the factory's that are kept here. The Dutch Copeman hath left off his building a mud house and is now dayly with the King to suffer him to build a stone house, how his desire will be complyed with I know not, but am of opinion that hee shall hardly gett a house to live in this raines. Tradeing is soe dead that Bracon cannot put off any of the Royall Companys goods at present. There is noe news of any shiping to windward. Captain Price and Boles are still in this roade.</p>

<p>Understanding by a canoe which came to this place from Cape Corsoe the indisposition of Mr Franckland, I humbly presume to trouble your worshipp with this letter, in which I have sent a true list of the goods that were in the warehouse when overhall'd by Mr Franckland at his departure (fearing through sickness hee may omitt itt). For the muskets, powder etc. I have as yet noe account of them, neither have I as yet (nor I beleeve I shall not) sell any till Mr Francklands returne, for till then wee shall have noe trade with the Quomboers (on whome almost our whole trade depends), of which I suppose your worshipp understands the reason ere this. I should make itt my business to be exact carefull and honest in the account expected from mee since Mr Francklands departure, which (the promises[?] considered and the great want of vendable goods) your worshipp cannot expect very considerable. However I am resolv'd my care both in that particular [and] the forts <span id=""page165"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-863"">pg 165</span></span>wellfare, and all my other actions shall declare how great my resentment is of the infinit favours your worshipp hath been pleas'd to heap on me. Wee have had very sickly season here since Mr Francklands departure, the Docter and most of the men in the fort have been very ill, but I bless God all upon their leggs againe except one (John Clarke) of whose recovery we dispaire, and hourly expect his death by the flux. The Accraers att the Dutch Towne and the Dutch themselves (whoe are it seems threatned too) expect Ahenesas comeing upon them, the blacks lying in the Dutch fort, and makeing great fiers in the night. Whether this may be a falce allarme or not wee are ignorant, and though wee are assured from all hands, that Ahenesa hath noe thoughts (but of amity) concerning this fort, yet I humbly hope our utmost care, both in good watching and putting our selves in the best posture of defence we can, will not be amiss.</p>

I sent your worship an account before by the same canoe that brought the letters which was writt by Charles [Towgood], and I have lain here ever since in expectation of your worships further order. In my last I forgott to give you an account that Captain Woodfine would desire your worship to tell his brother not to goe ashoare to Annamaboe upon any account whatsoever, for hee said that the Blacks would certainly murder him. I have sent per the canoe the boatswaine to bring downe the boate if your worship pleases, for if wee should breake a cable wee should want her very much.

<p>I came this evening aboard of Captain Lumley, whoe I found under saile off Amersa and is now up with Anishan, and I hope tomorrow shall be in Cabo Corsoe Roade. The Captain is wounded in the right shoulder but there is good hopes of his recovery. The Royall Companys concerns are nothing embazeled, only the sayes and sheets hee had from Cabo Corsoe are taken away. They conjecture the pyrate is [blank], for they came from the West Indias and carry's a ship of 30 gunns and 150 men of all nations. They tooke Captain Norths ship before they came from the Indias, and have taken severall of good vallue since they came upon the coast. His seacond was a Dutch interloper of 24 gunns they tooke to windward, and they had <span id=""page325"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1514"">pg 325</span></span>of him 70 Mk in gold, and have given him Captain Thompsons ship with both interlopers cargo's for a recompense, for the pyrates covett only gold and sayes, they will have the Companys gold they understand is att Arda if itt costs their lives. Captain Lumley presents his humble service to your honour and the rest of the Councill, desireing your honour will please to send off Docter Meade to search his wound, which his owne Docter cannot well doe, being hurt in the thumb. They have robbed Captain Lumley and all his folks of all their owne concerns and the ships furniture and provisions, soe that hee is in a verry low condition. Hee desires Docter Meade may be off with speede and bring off with him a case of lancetts and a douzen of fowles.</p></div></div>"

<p>February the 12th 1681/2 Mr John Winder in the night came to Ophra and the next morning showed me your Worships order, the which I most willingly complyed with, and he forthwith desired that the Phidalgoe might have notice of it, that your Worship and Gentlemen of the Councill had thought fitt to make him Chiefe factor on the Coast of Arda, and [he] desir'd he might have his residence here at Ophra and to be secured, otherwise Mr John Smith would have him to Guidah, he [= Smith] being the only man he was to suspect, as haveing notice of it before from Mr Spurvay. A letter of the 14th came to Mr John Winder from the said Mr John Smith to desire Mr Winder to looke after the debts which is owing to the Royall Company, unto whome I gave a particular account of all. The 22nd came another letter from Mr John Smith to Mr Winder intemating that Captain Thomas Woodfine had altered his mind and was resolved to take in his complement of slaves at Guidah, and wished Mr Winder to neglect noe time but come away as soon as possible might be. Mr Winder having received this letter makes all the meanes that might be to the Phidalgoe, telling him that Mr Smith had sent for him to Guidah with an intent to withdraw this factory, and therefore desired he might be protected <span id=""page250"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1175"">pg 250</span></span>by him, which being granted by the Phidalgoe Mr Winder then writes to Mr Smith that he was retain'd by the Phidalgoe and could not possibly come to Guidah. Mr Smith sent severall letters to him to come to Guidah and at last came himself, but was forced to goe back without him. I asked the reason of his being soe unwilling to goe with Mr Smith, he told me Mr Smith had a mind to keepe him at Guidah and come to settle here himselfe, and that he had received severall abuses by whitemen att Guidah and held it not a place fitt for a factory, in regard they had soe raised the prices of slaves to 25 per cent dearer then they are at Ophra.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1176"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1176""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-417"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1176"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>66</sup></a></span> Mr Smith not satisffied with Mr Winders staying at Ophra, thinking the Phidalgoe had kept him by force contrary to his owne will, was resolved to fetch him away in the night, the which resolution he put into practice and came to Ophra in the night with a spare hammack and men arm'd, and being without sent Francis Capell to the factory to acquaint Mr Winder with his designe, and desired Mr Winder to come to him with all speed. Mr Winder haveing received this message went along with Francis Capell to Mr Smith, and as he went acquainted some of the Phidalgoes people which lay at the gate (as they doe every night) that Mr Smith was come to fetch him to Guidah. This notice being given the towne was soone up in arms, which Mr Smith found to his cost, and seeing he could not gett Mr Winder away return'd to Guidah againe and began to make preparation to goe to Cape Coast, which after some time proceeded on his voyage. He being gone Captain Shepheard arrived about the 20th of June in Guidah Road, and goeing on shoare there was forc't to send for his goods, for the Blacks would not suffer him to goe on board againe before he had began to trade with them. Captain Shepheard then sent Mr Winder your Worships letters, which haveing received [Winder] sent Robert Chapman in a canoe on board to desire Captain Shepheard to bring his ship into Ophra road, where he would be ready to doe him all the service he could as per order from your Worship, but where he was he could not assist him in any thing, besides if he could come might do the Royall Company great service in it, for here was 30 slaves owing to the Company which would be shipt on board him, or if his goods should fall short might be made good by iron barrs, which with his other goods would be put off and not otherwise, but Captain Shepheard being on shoare before Mr Winders letters came could not comply with his desires, but writt him a letter and sent it by Robert Chapman who was then on board that in regard he could not comply with what Mr Winder had write him of, nevertheless he would send him his remaines to Ophra if he would send the said Robert Chapman for them, and withall order him to give a receipt for what he received, and it would be as well as if he had did it himselfe. Mr Winder haveing received Captain Shepheards letter was willing to goe on board of him, and <span id=""page251"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1177"">pg 251</span></span>desired me to speake to the Phidalgoe for him, but when the Phidalgoe heard he would goe on board a ship in Guidah road began to be doubtfull of his returne and refer'd his answer till another time, but Mr Winder being urgent with the Phidalgoe made him the more distrustfull of his comeing againe, which I told Mr Winder of but he told me that if I could gett leave of the Phidalgoe for him, he would become bound to me in a 200 pound bond,<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1178"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1178""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-418"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1178"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>67</sup></a></span> and likewise would give the Phidalgoe 60 slaves, that is the 30 that he owes the Royall Company and 30 more in iron, if he returned not againe but went on shoare at Guidah. On these considerations the Phidalgoe granted leave with my engagement together. He went on board and haveing been on board 2 dayes but the King of Guidah heard of it, and told Captain Shepheard if he would bring him on shoare he would give him a slave for his paines, the which Captain Shepheard soone put into practice and gott him on shoare, to the great loss of the Royall Company, for as soone as this Phidalgoe heard of it he sent for his 30 slaves in iron, which I kept him from for severall months and told him did believe Mr Winder would come againe, and had kept them yet in the factory had not Mr Armitage sold 500 bars to the French Merchant<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1179"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1179""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-419"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1179"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>68</sup></a></span> and he comeing to demand them the Phidalgoe said he would be paid first the 30 slaves due to him which Mr Winder contracted, and soe forc't me to pay the 30 slaves in iron. He being paid I refused to give the French Merchant the barrs Mr Armitage had sold him till further order from your Worship. I often desired Mr Winder to take some care for my departure from this place but he put me of from time to time, and told me would waite your Worships further order, he not finding me guilty of any thing of what was laid to my charge. The letter that came to your Worship in Andrew Crosbies name is false, he denyes it and saith he never writ any. Mr Smith and Mr Winder both questioned him about it and had his answer. When Mr Winder was gott to Guidah I often moved my willingness to be discharged and to goe home according to your Worships order. I also desired him to take some care to send booges downe to maintaine the factory, [he] have[ing] then soe many in his hands, and not let the Companys barrs be sold at soe pitifull a price as 3 lbs of booges per barr,<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1180"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1180""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-420"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1180"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>69</sup></a></span> but neither Mr Winder nor Mr Armitage would give me any answeare to what I writt, though severall desired, and might have had my passage in a Dutch ship if it had not been both theire neglects.

My humble request to take some consideration of this place, either by sending some releife or by other meanes to withdraw it.

I have used my best endeavour to gett up to Accra ever since the 1st of this instant, but by reason of a streame setting strong to leward and noe land breeze have been rather a looser than a gainer, although itt was this day I being under sayle standing into the shoare when the canoe came aboard, I being some 4 miles to windward of Allampo. And while I was standing in, the Portuguze waighed and made the best of his way for Ardra, hee purchaseing some 70 or 80 slaves att this Allampo, but the rates hee gave was verry greate, hee giveing for a woeman slave 7 peazes, which was little under 2 sayes, and 2 sayes for a man, likewise advanceing upon all other goods. I shall give your honour account att my returne; I made itt my business to know the reason wherefore hee did soe much advance upon slaves above the Companys price, his answer was hee gave not above 7 peazes 2a for a man and 6 [peaze] 1 angles for a woeman, considering he bought the sayes to windward for 14a and other goods verry cheape. I finding the currant to continue to leward and the Portuguze being gon, Mr Harper and I did consult what to doe, and did think itt the best way for the Companys interest for him to goe ashoare and see wheither they would lett us have slaves att your honours rates or noe, if not to take my first oppertunity to gett up to Cabo Corsoe according to order.</p>

<p>The Captain according to your worships request came to anchor before Tantonquery, where one of the chiefe men came a board to give the Captain an invitation ashoare and told us of much slaves they could procure in a little time for us. The Captain prest him to send the slaves aboard, but nothing would satisfy them, without the Captain or myselfe goeing ashoare first, soe I went ashoare and severall of the cabasheirs came to give me their hands, and was verry kind to mee the time I was ashoare. Wee have laid in the road 10 dayes and has got no more but 9 slaves of them. The King is up in the country and sent one of his men downe to tell the Captain he would come downe shortly with slaves, but there being very little money wee thought not worth the while of staying any longer, yet I doe beleeve that if a factory were setled here there might be good store of slaves procured, and in time might be a place of good trade.</p>
<p>I greatly feare that wee shall be put to a nonplus in procuring of our slaves, for nothing goes off wth us, but sayes, perpetuanoes, sheets and some tapsells.

<p>Your Honours of the 3d Instant I have received, but am sorry wee did not know your honours orders that wee were further to leward. The goods most in request to leward of Accra and att Allampo for slaves are powder, sayes, tapsells, sheets and some allejars and this I am verry certaine of, haveing been 3 day's ashoare att Allampo, but could not buy one slave, the reason was that our powder was gon before and the say's soe verry much damnified that they did not goe off there, and for the tapsells they would not take less then 4 peeces for 1 slave. There is now 32 slaves aboard, but the currant goeing strong to leward and all the provisions for the slaves expended, Mr Groome thought fitt to come up him selfe that hee might know your honours further orders, haveing with him the money in cash and an account of the goods that are disposed of, and if itt should please your Honour to order the slaves ashoare, sending downe a cargoe of sayes, powder, sheets, and allejars I doubt not but wee shall purchase a cargoe of slaves that will answer your honours expectation.</p>

<p>Yours of the 7th currant came safe to my hand by Mr Shears.

In the interim soe neare as I can remember concerning Agga Annamaboe etc. are as followeth.

Some time after I had severall threatnings from the Dutch that if I did not deliver the possession of the said places, they would gaine them by force of armes. That not takeing effect in greate grandure they protested; that was answered; still they protested, in protesting three times, and at last [we] not submitting to their threatnings, Dirick Willree the Generall<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1520"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1520""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-536"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1520"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>99</sup></a></span> made an offer to remitt the differance to the King of England and their States, which I submitted to and sent all my papers relateing to that differance to the Royall Company and the Company presented them to his Majestie in Councill. William Temple was then goeing into Holland on some other state affaires and his Majestie gave him to understand how ill hee resented the illegall proceedings of their Agents abroad. The Embassadour att his arrivall in Holland made knowne his Majesties pleasure in that particular to the States Generall, whoe immediately commanded the West India Company that they should give orders to their Agents, in noe hostile manner to disturb what interest the English nation was possest of in the time of warr, and from the Royall Company I had express commands not to relinquish a foot of ground that were then possest of, and from that time till this present I never had any dispute therein. In [16]68 from Succondee, Asshume and the Cabosheers sent downe and desired that our nation might settle att that place. I found by severall ships that had been there itt was a place verry considerable for trade and verry good landing, on which I sent Captain Cockram and another Whiteman with some quantity of goods, they stayed 8 or 10 day's, and left some of our black servants in charge of the goods, whoe sold considerable quantityes and were from time to time supplyed with what the trade required. Some of our factors every 10 or 14 dayes were there, and Asshume had the Companys flagg. The Dutch then nor before ever had any settlement or people att that place. Att Dickiscove wee found greate conveniency for corne, wood and water, especially in time of warr with the Dutch, whereupon I made a contract with <span id=""page327"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1521"">pg 327</span></span>Dick<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1522"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1522""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-537"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1522"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>100</sup></a></span> that for every ship that wooded, watered and corn'd att that place hee should have one perpettuanoe and one anchor of brandy, and for demanding the same I gave him a paper under my hand, and sent him a flagg, noe Dutch ever haveing had any pretentions to that place.

If wee must procure slaves at Wyamba, wee will want broad tapseeles, bright musquetts, brawles and sheets.

<p>Your Honours much esteemed dated the 25th August and the other the 31st ditto have received, wherein I was very sorry to heare the death of my friend Mr Frankland, and since your Honour and Councill have been pleased to make mee Chiefe of this fort, wherefore I give your Honour and Councill most humble and hearty thanks, worthy Gentlemen you may rest assured that I shall doe the utmost of my endeavour to procure a trade againe, but itt can not be done without trouble and some small charges, wherein I will be as spaireing as possible I can, and as for my accounts your Honour will find them at all times to agree with the warehouse, for I doe not intend to trust the blacks nor run out the Company's goods or trade with interlopers.</p>
<p>Captain George Phipps and I have according to order sold Mr Franklands goods at publique outcry, as per account will appeare, wee have found noe money then 5a in gold in his chest or elcewhere. What provisions out of Captain Bramfild I found here, according the account shall give the Company creditt.

<p>Mr Wendover hath with mee and Captain Phipps overhall'd the warehouse two times, wherein wee found no more goods as have given your Honour account the 27th August last, only 60 iron barrs more belonging to Mr Frankland, whereof 10 is paid for the debts he owes as per ballance of account will appeare. Mr Wendover will give your Honour an account of all actions and transactions, alsoe the account of the wanting of goods which comes to M 12.5 gold, besides provisions.</p>
<p>In answer of 31 August: Wee were informed Ahenesa would be downe with us with 3 armies, but wee hope it is but a lying report, however if it be or not wee are provided for them as much as possible wee can. I have received 59 gallons of brandy and shall give the Company creditt.</p>
<p>Mr Wendover hath had all the freedome imaginable to make up his pallavora with Ahenesa, as will appeare.</p>
<p>I send your Honour an inventory of Mr Franklands goods, which [we] found here, the account at what rates they were sold att, the account of paying the garrison 2 months pay beginning the 22nd July and ending the 16 September, an inventory of Mr Wendovers goods and chatties, and the pallavora with Ahenesa of our proceedings.</p>

Pray let Captain Phipps send mee my goods in the 5 hand canoe, for I want them. My desire is that your Honour and Councill will be pleased to send mee the rates and prizes of the disposall of the Company's goods in this place, that soe I may follow order, also if I shall give the Company creditt for the goods found here per remaynes in my booke or any other persons, the quantity and quallity, for the account is strangely to mee, therefore expect order. Your honour will be pleased to send a booke to keep my accounts in, some wax and paper. I desire your Honour to be pleased to lett mee have for a time James Mills, I being not able to come downe staires for lameness in my foot, and Mr Pley not yet well, have noe body to looke after the Companys concernes. Pray do not faile to give Ahenesa a gift, to be understood firelocks and spirrits, alsoe send some good powder and bright musketts. Ahenesa desires the same, in soe doeing wee may procure a traid and to hinder our neighbours. Now is the time according to my small oppinion. At the months end shall give my accounts, soe haveing noe more att present onely referr the remainder to Captain Phipps.</p>
<p>[PS] Mr Wendover nor Mr Frankland has paid Ahenesa monthly this 10 months.</p>

<p>Nota</p>
<p>August 21st 1681</p>
<p>Wee sent up to Ahenesa Ba: Conton a black with these following orders:</p>
<p>1st to desire Ahenesa to send his sonn Bobie or any other to know his demands</p>
<p>against Mr Wendover as soone as possible hee could.</p>
<p>2ndly That whome Ahenesa should send to our fort should goe free back againe.</p>
<p>28th ditto</p>
<p>Ahenesa sent to us 3 of his men with a message that the person wee sent to him the 21st was there safely arrived, but would not send his sonn Bobie or any other person to make a pallavora with us before wee tooke our oath upon the Bible and James Mills [took his oath on] their fittish that whome Ahenesa should send, should by us goe free back againe, where uppon Captain George Phipps and I tooke our oath upon the Bible, and James Mills their fettish, as aforesaid, all to regaine the creditt of the Royall Affrican Company, which is abominabley abused, and to procure a trade againe if itt be possible.</p>
<p>The 3 persons Ahenesa sent down to us tould us he designed noe harme against us, onely demanded his owne, of which at present wee are unsensible, and besides bid us beware of the Dutch, for they were all rogues and lyers.</p>
<p>September the 2nd</p>
<p>Ahenesas sonn Bobie came hither and made his palavora with us to say as followeth:</p>
<p><span id=""page170"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-876"">pg 170</span></span>That Ahenesa hath noe demands against Mr Wendover for lying with Boque his wife, neither did hee take any great notice of itt when wee tould his sonn Bobie of itt, onely ditto Bobie tould us his father Ahenesa demanded his due to him one [= on] his monthly sallery, and that the Company, Mr Wendover or any in the Company service should [n]ever be troubled in the least about his wife Boque.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-877"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-877""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-294"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-877"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>17</sup></a></span> To all this Ahenesas sonn Bobie tooke the fetish, and that hee would bring downe a trade, and wee to procure the same tooke the fetish that Ahenesas son or any hee sent to our fort should by us have and receive all civilllity whatsoever.</p>
<p>September the 3rd</p>
<p>Ahenesas sonn Bobie went away, with whome wee sent the aforesaid Black named Ba: Conto with our orders to give Ahenesa an account of our proceedings and what fetish his sonn Bobie hath taken in his behalfe, and that also wee desired ditto Ahenesa to confirm the same.</p>
<p>September the 9th</p>
<p>The aforesaid Ba: Conto returned from Ahenesa with 3 of his men whome sent us worde hee had not the least pretention either against Mr Wendover or any in this fort, and that hee approved of the fetish his sonn Bobie had taken in his behalfe and promised allwayes to confirm the same, and that hee had not nor never would have the least quarrell against the English here, and whatever stories wee heard from the Dutch, blacks or any other wee should not beleive them. Hee did assure us that if wee would procure him good bright musketts, powder and other goods, wee should not want either for slaves, or gold, but wee should have a constant trade. All these aforesaid is the certaine truth to us related in James fort att Accra the 9th September in Guiney 1681.</p>

They are somewhat deare in their slaves as yett, but the Portugueze nor Dutch buy's none soe I will lower them as much as possible I can.

<p>I have yours of the 7th instant, and am sorry to heare that my practices or behaviour amongst the Blacks, now I have given them almost halfe I have in the country, should be soe ill as to cause any of them to give your honour falce reports of mee. I can safely say I have not a word of differance with any black since I came to this place, which your Honour may be better inform'd by the Whitemen that has lived with mee. You are pleased to tax mee with entertaining the master of an interloper. Its true that since I came here that one Hudson, whoe was master of an interloper from Barbado's, came ashoare here and being my verry entimate freind told mee hee made bold to come up to the house to see mee, haveing a letter for mee from Barbado's. I desired him to goe from hence, which accordingly hee did, and I am sure was not halfe an houre ashoare. I was not att that time capeable to entertaine him or to seize him, haveing the feavour and ague. Upon the next day hee writt mee a noate ashoare per a black that [being] formerly acquaintance and seeing mee to be a new beginer to house keeping, hee had sent mee a sow pigg and 3 Muscoval ducks. Mr Sheares comeing here since told mee the ducks belonged to your Honour, and that Captain Clarke heard Hudson say they were sent you from Barbado's, which has ever since been a trouble to mee that hee should give mee your present, although att first I designed to present them to you, but when Mr Sheares told mee the ducks was your honours I was resolved to know the truth of itt and spake with Captain Clarke before I sent them. I hope you will not any wayes take this amiss of mee, for I protest had there been the least word of sending them to you as a present from Barbado's spoken to mee, I would not have kept them 12 houres. I have per bearer sent the 3 ducks and a douzen of good fowles with them, which I hope you will please to except of, and hope your honour will harbour noe ill thought of mee for that action, haveing writt the whole truth of itt, and as for the selling of slaves itt was more then could doe for I have not bought any since I came here. Itts true a boy that I had before I came to Cabo Corsoe, att my first comeing here had stolen severall things from mee and haveing whipt him, [he] run away from mee for two dayes, and rashly and foolishly I sent him aboard ship and sold him for rum, which I have often since repented, and hope your Honours pardon, haveing writt you the whole truth to every passage, but suppose the informer might make an addition to them. I doe not expect to doe the least thing that hold can be taken of, but itt will be immediatly carryed to your Honour, for I am much envyed by comeing here, but not by the Blacks but whites. Mr Thelwall taxes mee much with informing your honour against him, and that particularly I writt that hee had cursed you and spoken verry ill words of you; I begg your Honour to favoure mee soe farr with a line or two for to cleare mee of itt, for without hee will not be satisfied. If should wrighte any such thing I should be a verry greate rogue, for I never heard him say ill of you. His man Francis [i.e. Nixon?] justifies itt, and sayes hee had itt from credible people att Cabo Corsoe. I have delivered in my last months accompt, <span id=""page149"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-799"">pg 149</span></span>and tooke upwards of 15 marks of gold besides the corne.

The Dutch man heareing of the said Cabasheere standing up for the English, hee sent him word that one day hee hop'd to see him at the Mina without his head, hee sent him word againe that hee had not better speake too much, least Tickadoe make him carry his stoole after him. The Dutch sells their perpetuano's greene att 8 angles each, ours are fair before them, some of the Blacks loves their collor best itt being a deeper dye; they sell alsoe their sheets at 32 per bendy, hee haveing lowered his price two dayes agoe telling the Negro's that if they would bring their money to him, and not carry itt to the English hee would sell 32 per bendy.

Besides Captain Rickard had 1 chest off first in his yatt as hee desired, if hee had not liked it he might not have sent his long boate imediatly ashoare with his mate for more.

<p>Your honours of the 8th instant by Docter Griffin I have received. As to the palavora with Abracon hee doe faithfully promise to advance the Royall Companys trade and maintaine their interest in this place. As to the commission money Captain Bracon stood hard upon 3 angles but by much perswasions have brought him to except of 2 angles per marke, which hee expects your honour will be pleas'd to send him from Cabo Corsoe for all the money that hath been taken since the goods were first consign'd to him and soe once a month for the future. Bracon hath sent downe by Docter Griffin 5 marks, 10 angles of good gold for account of the Royall Company, which payes for the 10 chests of sheets last sent up; Hee desires your honour would send him more for account of the Royall Company 10 chests of sheets with 1 anchor of brandy for this months allowance with one halfe anchor which Docter Griffin borrowed of him. The trade is but bad at present. Last night came in this roade a small ship with Companys jack and pendant but I have understood that hee is an interloper bound to the Bite.</p>

<p>Yours under 12 instant I have received and am sorry that you should beleeve I should be concern'd with Mr Wendover in acting anything contrary to the interest of our masters the Royall Affrican Company. What I know touching Mr Wendover is as followeth, and the reason of my not acquainting you with it sooner was the want of an oppertunity and I thought it not worth while to send a canoe on purpose. Mr Wendover did sell unto Captain Mathews 4 woemen slaves for sayes [and] perpetuanoes, and did also buy more for gold, the woemen was the same you take notice of was denied Captain Bowler and I must doe Mr Wendover the justice to say they were not denyed by him but mee (he being at that time very sick) and I will if required take my oath that at that time they were not slaves but pawnes, as was then told to Captain Bowler, and that when Ahenesa sent downe his son to sell them he also sent that Mr Wendover should send them a board the first ship, and if hee refused to take them away and sell them to the Dutch or Portuguese. Captain Mathews being then in the roade, Ahenesas son would have them sent a board before he went.</p>
<p>As to Mr Wendovers sending a letter to Captain Mathews at Mingo,<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-845"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-845""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-288"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-845"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>11</sup></a></span> hee to my knowledge never did, and for helping him to the slaves out of the Portuguese he nor I knew nothing of nor was concern'd in any way with the buying or selling them. Mr Wendover did further buy out of Captain Mathews 2 great guns for the defence of the fort, because the Accras dayley play the rogue with us, and there being never a gun in the fort that will carry far enough to command them. Hee also bought out of the New England man (whoe was in the roade when wee fought the Accraers and without whose helpe wee could not have got water) some pork and <span id=""page160"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-846"">pg 160</span></span>pease. As to what you take notice of concerning the powder that was hiding in the souldiers roomes when I tooke an account of the goods att this place, that was noe fault of mine, for I went as far as my orders gave me leave and gave an exact account of what I found, and had any one told mee of them I should have put them in my account with the rest.</p>

I wish I had a few green and blew perpettuanos more, for those that I had of that sort which were 8 are all gone and they aske for them now extreamly.

<p>Your honours of the 17th instant I have received. In answer as to the building the factory [I] must acquaint your Honour that except people expert in building be sent up the worke will never be accomplished, for the people here will know noe pathern nor draught, but will make a house to their owne minds, which I see by their cutting of the halfe from the first draught, and what they build the walls does not exceed one foot thickness which I told them was but laboure in vaine, whereto they answered that if your honour sent up any here there should be noe want of earth to build with, but for themselves they know not to manage soe greate a worke as the draught of that factory is.</p>
<p>As to account of goods consigned to Captain Bracon be pleased to know that the 6 chests of sheets are only sold, which hee saies hee bought of your honour att 4a per chest, which comes to in all Mk 3, the which sume of 3 markes hee hath sent your honour per the bearer in good gold for account of the Royall Company desireing a receipt for the same.</p>
<p>The boysadoes and perpetuanoes remaine entire and not sold, neither can hee put off the perpettuanoes att 10a per piece, but saith if your honour will consider that this is the place where all goods are sold cheaper then to leward and abate 1 angle upon the perpettuanoes hee can immediatly dispose of what are here and doe the Company service in disposing of a considerable quantity more in a short time. Hee also desires your Honour to abate him 1 peaze upon each chest of sheets, if granted hee desires 10 chests may be sent up for account of the Royall Company. The marchants do not denie the payment of one piece of sletia and halfe an anchor of brandy, to which I myselfe was wittness at Mr Nightingals settleing, but they demand itt againe as due once a yeare.</p>

<p>Since my last letter from Accra I have had noe oppertunity of sending to you, but the 14th of this instant, being ashoare att Allampo received yours dated the 4th of this instant, the man comeing by land with itt, and by the same bearer I sent your honour a letter, giveing you account of <span id=""page294"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1378"">pg 294</span></span>my proceeding in trade and what slaves I have purchased in men, woemen, boyes and girles. And att present am ashoare useing my best endeavoure for to answer your honours commands. I have aboard 28 slaves, there being 12 men, 13 woemen, 2 boyes and 1 girle, and may purchase more woemen but I doe forebeare because I would have them bring one man with one woeman. I am in greate hopes by the full of the moone or the next windward currant to be comeing up for Cabo Corsoe with 50 or 60 slaves in or more. As for my proceeding downe to Allampo contrary to your command, was upon the account of purchaseing of slaves, for there is none to be had att Ningo but what comes from thence, and I did not purchase a slave ashoare. And Allampo is [not] the place that itt has been in other times; for the slaves I first purchased, the man that sould them sent his men with the goods up in the country for the purchaseing of more slaves, and are not come downe as yett, but I am in hopes that this weeke may proove better then the rest of the time has. Not else to acquaint your honour with but that slaves are att verry high rates and specially them that are good.</p>

<p>I bless God I have overcome a desperate and dangerous feavour (under which I hav a long time linguished) soe far as I am againe uppon my leggs, though soe weake I am scarce able to stand.</p>
<p><span id=""page167"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-871"">pg 167</span></span>Though Mr Frankland is dead yet must needs complaine of a very grosse abuse he has put on mee in two or three particulars of the invoice of goods he gave mee at his departure, for haveing severall times desireing him to overhall the warehouse hee still put mee off till the very instant of his departure to Capo Corsoe, and then he went into the warehouse with a penn and ink, and in an hurry, would not suffer mee to overhall all the goods, especially the pottkeys, but made mee sett them downe as hee dictated, and hee being my supperiour I could not helpp itt, but hee protested the truth of itt. I confess I was much dissatisfied, but was induct to beleeve him, not knowing his actions then as I have heard since, for which I am sorry. I feared the pottkeys at first, because hee made and gave soe many of them away, soe that upon the tale of them since I find 24 less then hee assured mee there was. That this is true I call the God of truth to witness and I hope your Worshipp will beleeve mee, for in the presence of God I wish I may forfeit my eternall happyness if any goods hath gone out of the warehouse more than my enclosed account makes out since Mr Franklands departure. I must confess the thoughts of being so overcatcht by one I thought my friend, was a great trouble to mee in my sickness, but God that knowes the secreets of my soule knows my inocence too, and I hope your worshipp will not suffer mee to come to any damage where I am guiltless, through the unequall dealings of my superiour, since I never yett did wrong to any man, but will still make itt my great endeavour to answer your worshipps goodness to mee, in my dilligence and fidellity as long as I live. Another mistake he made was, hee gave me an account but of 10 Guynie clouts, when (under other goods) there was 82. And in his account 19 paper brawles, when there was but 7½ This is the errors and God knows (and others here) occationed by Mr Frankland, the rest is right, onlely divers goods cutt by him for cloaths etc. Besides of the 39 peeces of tapsele 3 (that were on the shelfe, and reckoned to mee) were owned, and prooved, to be due to a black for cows Mr Frankland had bought and delivered per order since Mr Nightingalls arrivall. I was sent hither by your worshipp in a time of very intricate and clandestine dealeings (as appears since), though I was kept ignorant, and I thank God inocent of all, but I hope for the future wee shall have noe more such base transactions here, which wee'll use all imaginable care to prevent. Enclosed is my account since Mr Frankland departure, and Mr Nightigalls receipt for the money what goods were sold while Mr Frankland was there. I constantly gave him the money, as I received itt, and hee tooke an account of the goods delivered (as I suppose Mr Wendover can informe your worshpp) and told mee hee would make itt up in his account. If hee hath not done it and your worshipp require itt I can doe it out of my booke. Two slaves bought by Mr Frankland hath died in his absence.</p>
<p>I most humbly begg your worshipps pardone for my tediousness and bad writting, which is occasioned by my sickness, and doe most humbly and heartyly thank your worshipp for your great goodness to mee.</p>

<p>I received yours of the 9th instant and understand that you have not conveniency to send the quantity of goods which wee did send for, these are therefore to desire you to send a small quantity of goods att the present which is for the present occasion, which is as followeth, 4 barrells powder, a small quantity of perpetuano's, boysado's and narrow tapsells, which small quantity of goods I would desire you to send with all speed that may be and more as you have conveniency, for I doe beleeve that wee shall have a verry considerable trade by meanes of the Captain of the Arcany's. The Captain of the Arcany's is att the charge of sending a canoe for some goods and would desire you to send what you can besides, as you find conveniency, for here is a greate many traiders come downe [so] that if wee had goods wee should have a greate trade. If you send powder if itt be 20 barrells wee need not house itt, and other goods may sell a greate deale, for the Captain of the Arcany's saith that hee will keepe all the money for mee to take if I can possible have goods for him, for hee professes greate kindness to mee.</p>

<p>According to your Worships desire of the 10th instant, thought fitt to acquaint you that narrow niccanees and narrow tapsells are in great demand, for now the Arcanies are come downe, but I cannot expect to sell any of those goods I have on board by reason the two ships that are here sell cheaper then I can, vizt sayes att 12 and 13 angles and perpetuano's att 8 and 9, but I beleeve they have almost don for they sold greate quantity's yesterday of both sorts, besides other goods; soe that after they are gon I may be in hopes of selling my goods if nothing comes downe in the interim, for I heare there are two at Dickiscove. I have not sold any thing since my last to your Worship, onely one halfe barrell of powder and the remainder of the sheets, for there has been noe trade to speak of since before yesterday. Just att my closeing up of the letter I received one from your Worship and Councill wherein I was ordered to procure one barrell of pitch and one ditto of tarr, which I have don out of one of the ships that is here, but would not pay for itt before acquainted your Worship with the price vizt one barrell of pitch, 1 ounce and one ditto of tarr halfe an ounce, soe shall only stay for your Worships further orders. I would have sent this by the same bearer that brought yours, but hee was gon before I received mine, for I did not receive itt before 10 a clock this morning.</p>

Itt is 4 foot thick and 3 foot in foundation deepe. Captain Starland and Mr Towgood is now in the road windbound, they have in all about 100 slaves aboard both their vessells, and I supply their wants both with wood and water. If they stay here any time, I immagine Captain Shears may in a manner be up as soone as they with his loading of slaves per what I understand by a canoe last night from Allampo. Ahenesa will be att home this weeke with great quantity of slaves, and then shall render advice what progress hath made in his atcheivments.

<p>Your worshipp and Councells letter under the 2nd instant received per Mr Pley, and give you my hearty thanks for your kindness in makeing mee chiefe of this place and doe asshure you I will take all the care imaginable to advance the interest of the Royall Company my masters, and doe not question (if can gett goods) but to take as much gold as any factory upon the coast. I take notice of what your worshipp writes touching Mr Pleys being second etc. and shall observe your orders in every particular. I shall also take care to use my endeavour to regaine the affection of the blacks in this place (who I can asshure you are a company of great rogues from whome comes noe trade, and whosoever lives here must keepe them in feare of himself or elce hee must keepe nothing here) but more especially of Ahenesa (from <span id=""page162"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-853"">pg 162</span></span>whome all the trade comes), who I intend to goe see, as soone as Mr Wendover is well to goe up with mee, whoe hath been extreamly ill of a voiolent feavour in soe much that wee looked every day for his death but praised be God he is something better, when he is in a condition shall observe your order to send him up, Ahenesa haveing sent severall times for he that was made Chiefe, and for Mr Wendover. Here inclosed I send your worshipp an account of what goods remained in my warehouse when Mr Wendover was made incapable of his imployment, also what slaves etc. belongs to the fort, with last months account, which you will find to be very small (the Quomboers not comeing downe), and your worshipp will find by the account of goods what goods was received from aboard Captain Bowler, also what slaves delivered said Captain. (I have seen a great many goods come out of shipps but doe asshure your worshipp never see any come out in such a condition, being most of them spoyl'd by carelessness.) In my account I have given the Company creditt for the goods etc. received from aboard Captain Bramfill (but know noe price of the provisions) and shall in my next give them creditt for the corne received from the 15 hand canoe, haveing scarce enough corne in the castle to last 4 dayes. Before she came I had sent a 5 hand canoe to Wyamba to fetch corne but there was none to be had.</p>
<p>I have according to your order sent what damnified goods is in the warehouse, but for the potkeys they are all sold, and had I more could have sold them. The price of them I knew not onely as Mr Nightingale told mee that I should sell them at an angle per peece, but you will find by my account I have got more for them. When Mr Wendover is in a condition shall observe your worshipps order about his goods, an account of which you receive with the rest. I writt your worshipp about 5 dayes since per a 2 hand canoe on purpose for to acquaint you in what distress wee were in for corne, but the canoe was unfortunately cast away.

I sent the mony by the 5 hand canoe when she went to Wyamba to corne and sent for the man but could heare nothing of him, he was one of the pawnes of the fort. If any canoe comes from your worshipp they had best have a care of touching there for they will serve them in the same manner. I doe not question but in a few dayes to have some of them in the fort, and if have will make them pay severly.</p>

<p>Hereunder follow the reasons of the disgust the Blacks has taken against Mr Winder, vizt.</p>
<p>1st. When he first came to settle amongst them his bad language and carriage suited not their humours, which occasioned a small breach.</p>
<p>2ndly. Upon which he left their towne and the Companys factory and tooke up his aboade for some time att Captain Wybornes house, whome they knew was not concern'd in the Companys business, which created in them a great dislike to him, they being naturally covetous of trade.</p>
<p>3rdly. His endeavouring to gett into their debts, and actually running into one Captain Bibbees debts, when afterward they understood hee did it with a designe to goe off with one Fullwood, an interloper then in port, to which end hee had actually put aboard 8, and laid under an obligation to make itt up 40 slaves. 4thly. His cutting of sletias and lessening the bunches of beads, which they looke <span id=""page241"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1150"">pg 241</span></span>upon as an absolute cheate to their country.</p>

<p>Yesterday I received yours, and as to old corne there is 225 chests at Agga. Captain Cole had all mine but 20 odd chests I keepe for my own spending. As I w[r]itt in my former letters, I cannot buy corne here under 1 angle and a halfe per chest, and our Capasheers will not sell under and I beleeve they buy up all the corne themselves. Last night came into this roade Captain Draper, hee saith hee will sett saile when the breaze comes in. This day thought lett him gett what corne hee can off, his boate is gon to Agga for his corne, for hee wont loose the windward currant. The ship that came downe the other day ly's in Anishan roade is an interloper, hee wont tell his ships name nor his owne, but the Blacks say they call him Captain James and hee snuffles in the nose, that is all I can learne of the Blacks. As to trade itt is verry small att present, for I have taken but one bendy this two dayes of trade and that was for iron barrs, but I hope when the interloper is gon and the Dutch sayes, I shall have a trade againe.</p>
<p>[PS] Captain Drapers 50 chests corne is all on board.</p>

<p>This comes with the accounts of Ophra and to certifie you how things are with us att Arda, haveing no knowledge of men [sic — omission?] a canoe goeing from Widdaw, by reason of the canoemen which went in her were those which came downe with Captain Lowe and they haveing soe plaid the rogue with him I durst not send any letters by them if I had known of her goeing, for fear of their miscariage. These accounts att Ophra may seeme something strange to your worship, if you had butt seen what condition I found the factory in and what bad customes factors had brought up here since I went home, not knowing how to deale with the Blacks, for they are a very encroching people to men that are strangers to their customes, and I have been forced to be att an extraordinary charge in reducing them to their former customes againe and I hope to continue itt whilst I have the power in my hands, but if your worship send another above mee I doe not know how hee will deale with them, for the Blacks will not lett any instructions to be given to a new Cheife but will make him condition with them before hee shall have any considerable discourse with the old Cheife about their customes, but I hope the next account will be more easier to the Company then this, for the charge hath been ogmented in regard of an unhappy war which broke forth among the Blacks and I was forced to give 2 slaves for one barrell of powder for to secure the Companys concerns.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1098"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1098""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-383"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1098"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>32</sup></a></span> If Mr Wyborne please, who is the bearer of this letter and accounts, hee can give you certifection att large.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1099"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1099""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-384"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1099"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>33</sup></a></span> The same thing is by masters of ships as by a <span id=""page226"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1100"">pg 226</span></span>new factor, for when they have the cargoe in their owne disposeing the Blacks will have things att their own rate, knowing that they know nothing of the customes of the country.</p>
<p>I would desire your worship to send booges downe by the first oppertunity for I have none for my present use but am forct to borrow of the blacks, and they will not lend above 50 lbs of booges for a slave and att the arrivall of a ship will have 78 lbs for them, for I have not any goods that I can put off for booges but to great loss. James Boyde humbly requests of your worshipp to send him your discharge for hee is willing to goe home, his time being expired. If you please to send him his discharge pray send two honest men downe which can wright, for John Waterhouse is dead and shall have but two left which is not enough for this.</p>
<p>PS. Here is a great man who desires your worship to send him a drum and hee will send you a slave for itt.</p>

Here is one Crosbie, whoe the people would have sent away from this country severall times before Mr Winder came downe, but I would not suffer them, and since by his informing the blacks of what your factors or masters of ships doe or say, and alsoe informing in trade, that hee is in such favour that Mr Winder told mee that he would verry willingly have him up to Capo Corsoe with him, but hee beleeved the people would not let him goe. Mr Armitage pretends that hee desires verry much that hee could send him, but when I had spoke to the Blacks and they had consented if Mr Armitage and Mr Winder would desire itt, Mr Armitage then told Mr Winder that hee could not send him yett, but hee would in a short time. I doe verryly beleeve Mr Armitage had rather Mr Winder had run off from the coast then to Cabo Corsoe, this fellow was verry help full in getting Mr Winder out of his place.

Your honours orders I have sett up att the gate and am seveere in seeing them prosecuted according to order, and not one free woeman I suffer to lye in the fort, which seemes tedious to those soe habbituated and make them raile against mee, speaking hardly about itt, which I question not but your Honour has heard thereof or will suddainely, yett nevertheless Ile performe your commands. Have received every thing per the sloope as your honour advised. As for the nero and strafino corall I expect within this day or two a marke for the moiety, which will answer what I expected, which will doe more then purchase 4 slaves. Atta Barba is now with mee and has brought 5 bendy's for sheets, and had I 50 chests I would sell them in a months time and other goods with them. Hee purposes to Cabo Corsoe next weeke; this night he goes to Barracoe. Have dispatcht the sloope with wood water and corne sufficient for the slaves, and alsoe spar'd 1 iron bound teirce and 1 barrell which I expediated as soone as received your command.</p>

<p>Yours of the 11th instant per the Cabo Corso Briganteen, Mr Towgood Commander, have received, with 200 musquetts, 200 paper brawles, 40 sayes, 25 perpettuanoes, 100 herba longees, 50 Guinea stuffs and 30 blanketts, which I will use my utmost endeavor to dispose of for my Royall masters interest for slaves and gold, as your Honour directs.</p>
<p>Att present all manner of trade is soe dead that at all the forts here has not this two months taken 4 ounces. The reason is Ahenesa hath been out against the Arcanies and Akims, soe not any traders from any parts dare adventure to come downe, but this day news came that he had taken the Taffo country with some few slaves, the major part of the people fled for succour to the Akims.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-921"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-921""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-311"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-921"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>31</sup></a></span> This day 3 slaves was brought, 2 woemen and 1 man, but I bought them not by reason to great a price, which was 9 musquetts apeece, which in my apprehension is extravigant rates for my Masters proffitt. If Ahenesa is conquered this will certainly be a place of good and considerable trade, if not he will suffer noe Arcanie nor Akim to buy any thing here but what comes through his hands, which he makes double proffitt off, soe expect what the events will be and in the meane time hope for the best. [I] shall also follow your Honours order in demanding satisfaction of Ahenesa for the 100 musquetts.<a id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-922""></a><sup>32</sup> Also inquired of the soulders here what man had the 50 musquetts, and the Gunner Thomas Barrett inform'd me it was Quobing, and that he delivered them himselfe, which shall likewise be demanded. I have paid him noe rent since I came nor has not been paid for severall months before except 1 benda per Mr Nightingale.</p>
<p>In your Honours you are pleased to charge me with extravigant expences at Christmas. It hath allwayes been acustomary to give more then what I charge in my account, and whosoever lived here will informe your Honour, and Mr Pley can verrifye the account in that respect and more then what I charge, soe begg your candor therein.</p>
<p>Your Honour writes and has likewise sent downe Humphrey Davis to be my assistant, but in what capacity I cannot imagine he is able to assist me as Mr Pley hath done, for I dare not trust him as a second to keep the key of the warehouse by <span id=""page184"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-923"">pg 184</span></span>reason he had not given any security as Mr Pley hath, in whose fidelity and ability I could confid, and [he] always delivered every months account just to mee according to noeates given him, and your Honour does me a great diskindness in bereaveing me of his good company. I leave all the relation of affaires to his information. I have found all goods right that has bee under his management which has been all here, but this month I found a musquett under one of the Arda's bedds, and whipt him severely for it. He confest his crime and likewise charged a free black, Ashuma one of the black souldiers, to have been in confederacy with him in stealing 9 more, which he mistrusting run away the day before, but if I can catch him I will send him away on the Company account,<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-924"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197261767-milestone-924""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197261767-note-308"" id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-924"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>33</sup></a></span> also 6 barrs of iron which is now wanting and 1 blew narrow baft which he threw over the wall when he went to turne them as they were drying, which wee here doe by reason of a damp warehouse every month.

Mingo is the best place, for there is both gold, and the best in Guinea, and slaves, it is not above 2 leagues from Alampo, and if your Honour approves of the designe I will make inquiry therein, and imagine itt more feasable then Tanton Querry and of more considerable trade per 10 to 1, soe expect your resolve per next and leave it to Mr Shears and Charles Towgoods</p>

<p>I would have writt to you this morning by Mr Thelwalls boy but that hee was gon <span id=""page287"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-1349"">pg 287</span></span>before I came ashoare; however I am verry sorry that I have displeas'd your Worship with my stay att this place, which I could not helpe for twas 8 a clock before I came to an anchor here, I being becalmed which forct mee to itt, a little before which time 2 French men came to anchor off of Anishan, as likewise Captain Lumley. I kept a light for him till 11 a clock to come into the roade this morning (for twas calme all night). I see the two ships aweigh as likewise Captain Lumley, one of the two ships standing to windward and the other to leward, but presently the ship that stood up tackt and stood downe againe and Captain Lumley being taken astayes, was forc't to stand up, att which time the Frenchman was almost aboard him with a red ensigne but our King's jack (with which hee tooke all the ships), and presently fired a valley of small shott and three great guns with shott, att which time Captain Lumley answered him in the like with two pateraro's and some small armes and then the Frenchman fired about 8 or 10 guns shott and all as likewise about some 3 or 4 valley's more of small shott, which carried away Captain Lumley's foot of his maine sayle out of the bolt rope and as I beleeve kill'd Captain Lumley, for I presently see the ensigne struck halfe mast downe and the ship yeilded to the Frenchmans boate which presently went aboard of her, and soone after Thomas Amamaboe came from him to mee and told mee to goe under the forte, which [I] was ready to doe before but could not for had noe wind, but I sent ashoare a note by him to Mr Thelwall to send mee off some great and small canoes, which hee did, which towed us in under the forte, where wee now lye, and presently I see the Frenchman take the two interlopers without fireing a gun, the one being Captain Summervill the Scotch man, the other Captain Lowes brother Thompson. I likewise understand by the Blacks that they tooke a Dutchman up to windward and left the men ashoare at Succondee. I suppose the biggest of the two ships might have about 28 or 30 gunns, being well mann'd to sight. I only stay here for your Worships further orders, for itt will be in vaine to goe before the Frenchman be passed by Accra, which I beleeve will be in a day or two. Not elce att present to informe your worship of (though I wish I had not this).</p>

<p>This brings an account of our proceedings since wee left Caboe Corsoe. To mention the number of Negroe slaves wee received from Annamaboe may be unnecessary, wee proceed to relate what Negroe slaves wee purchased at Wyamba and soe leeward to this place. Our purchase at Wyamba was in all 13 Negroe slaves. Some time wee spent there, for that the natives promised a great trade for slaves, if wee would stay, which when wee found frustrate, wee sail'd downe to Accra. Here indeed wee had the choyce of 19 Negroe slaves, out of which wee could hardly find 7 fitt to be putt aboard shipp. Wee fear some may be conceald, for what reason know not, the fault is not ours. From Accra wee received 120 pieces brawles, and those much damaged; wee likewise received 20 pieces of long cloth, in which but 4 pieces vendible.

This is what we ought to acquaint your Worshipp with, to avoid prolexity is our care. Wee are now promised a quantity of slaves if goods to purchase them. Wee wait your Worshipps answer.</p>

Ralph Hassell<span class=""br""></span>James Fort, Accra, 16 Dec. 1682</h2>
<p>Yours of the 22nd last past have now before mee, in which you verry much blame mee for my journey to Quomboe and say itt was not design'd for my masters interest. However itt be your good pleasure to conjecture soe, yett I know itt was [for my masters' interest], for two reasons I will demonstrate. First, as you are all men of reason what pleasure could you immagine I could take in soe unpleasant and tedious journey when itt hath been the death of one factor already, of which I had caution. Secondly, what delight could any man unless a prodigall receive in spending whatever hee had in the company of unknowne people, and such a one I am not, haveing not wherewithall to be lavish of, and likewise I went up to open the way that traiders might come to the forte and that none of his people should goe on board of ships to buy any goods nor any one for them, which I doe verry well <span id=""page195"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197261767-milestone-966"">pg 195</span></span>know there doth, which in plaine is the mine of all these forts. And as for prizes of slaves the agreement was on this condition, that your Honour would ratifie itt, and since your displeasure therein is knowne He not performe any contract and have bought noe slaves since. I did renew noe old thing about Mr Wendover and his wife, butt [it] being moved to mee thought good to informe you thereof, that I might have further inspection in that affaire. I have by Captain Churchey received his account [of?] debts on this day sennitt. On Monday last I sent a messenger to demand these debts and informe Ahenesah how ill hee hath served the Company in not rendering satisfaction all this time, but as yett I heare noe answer. My meaning by noateing my account in conformity is after examination thereof to make mee debtor to ballance thereof, and when you please to order itt and when your orders shall be obeyed. I find your displeasure greate likewise is extravagant expences. I know not of one angle but what was really expended and paid. I am heartyly sorry I cannot gett better traiding, which I have inform'd your honour above. In the margent you likewise order mee to send up Mr Wendovers goods att Accra. I know of none but houshold stuff, and 3 sowes, 12 piggs, for I never had any accompt from any that succeeded him, and if your Honour knowes what they are pray informe mee and send an oppertunity and they shall be sent up. I wrote your Honour per the last the great necesity wee stand herein for want of corne, yett have had noe supply. I can gett none here. Pray send for the slaves up or elce they will starve. I have here inclosed sent up Novembers accompt. I find errors in the goods sent per Captain Churchey, which please to rectifie. In the case <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-454#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-978"">no.447</a> is mentioned 30 blanketts, which all the men in fort can justifie there is but 25 and many rotton att the edges and much motheaten. Likewise in the case <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197261767.book.1/actrade-9780197261767-div2-255#actrade-9780197261767-milestone-574"">no.251</a> with chalke, for the black marke cannot be seen, is mentioned 20 good say's, in which case is not one good and I beleeve the case lay halfe up in buldge water or else under the fall of pump water. I open'd only the upper side and lett itt stand in the sun, both the wrapper and matt are rotton. In the chest of white beads no.l67M I have not the contents, nor the prizes of looking glasses that I must sell for, I have ventered to sell 3 at la per piece. Likewise a barrell of tarras instead of a hogshead.</p>

I have made noate to purchase 5 or 600 chests of corne, and shall gett it as cheap as possible I can, but not to exceed 2 angles per chest, but fear itt will be very difficult to gett soe much, itt being very scarce att present.</p>

Secondly, for a speedier way of finding an increase of trade, I have studied and ponderd on all immaginable meanes but nothing will be of a trade till the warrs are over, that the wayes may be free for up countrys to come downe, which I conjecture your Honour is sufficiently sencible thereof, which if you please to aske any black that can informe you of the same.
