<p>These I send on purpose, being much importunated by the Arcanyes for two or three hundred of brass neptunes, not of the largest size, those from one pound and a halfe to two pound. I sold just now all that I had, being 146 which has layne by here for some months, all at 6ta per pound, and have received 7oz 8a for two hundred and forty pounds. I fear the stilliards are naught; I request the weight of them, to know whether I am wronged, and the next parcell will retrive the loss if [so]. Here is mony some quantitty, but for perpetuanoes blew, sheets and such goods I know there is none at Cabo Corso. I beg that the neptunes may be here by tomorrow at noone.</p>

The reason of not present delivery to Captain Buttram his complement of corne, is that by reason of great quantityes of corne lying togather I thought it fitt to order the corne to be kept in its teers [= tiers], for the better preservation of it from buggs and weavels. The ware [ = war] coming on, it cannot presently be brought in. I sent my second up to that purpose for the forwarding it home, which is as sure as as if it were in the warehouse (only for the present). I am now dispatching Captain Buttram. I do not want corne for him, although I did instant to his mate of what you write. Understanding by him, that the Captain is very well provided with beans and other Negroe provitions, therefore for the surety and sooner dispach of other shipps, proposed it to him. For the better dispatch of Captain Sturt, pray be pleased to order him to take the rest of his corne in at Agga, of Mr Cross. In the interim shall forward home the rest of the corne, which is dayly coming. You yourselves know that no Black is punctuall to his word to a day or teen [= ten]. That and the ware hath been the principall reason of my not being ready. There is nothing of what is aforementioned, or other cases, but that I have at all times acted the Companyes best interest, which never shall be wanted in me.</p>
<p>If chance I shall be disapointed in which I have don for the good of the corne, I have money ready to purchase corne, therefore pray be not offended for the present disapointment, be assured that shall be ready in a very short time.</p>

<p>The RAC factory at Komenda ('Comenda', 'Commenda'), east of Sekondi, had been re-established, after earlier short-lived occupations, in October 1683.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-417"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-417""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-198"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-417"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>1</sup></a></span> It was then apparently occupied continuously down to April 1688, when it was again abandoned, in the face of a local war.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-418"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-418""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-199"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-418"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>2</sup></a></span> During 1686–8 it was being fortified, but this had not been fully effected by the time of its withdrawal. Komenda was situated within the kingdom of Eguafo ('Aguaffo'), whose king resided at 'Great Komenda', a few miles inland from the coastal trading centre.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-419"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-419""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-200"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-419"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>
<p>The Komenda factory was mainly important for the gold trade, although it also supplied corn for the provisioning of slave ships, and there are a few allusions during 1686–8 to the supply of slaves. In 1681–3, the principal local trader with whom the English dealt had been one 'Captain Bracon'; but by 1686 he had been replaced in this role by John Cabess, who was indeed to remain a prominent trader-chief of Komenda down to his death in 1722.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-420"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-420""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-201"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-420"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>4</sup></a></span> In addition, the English dealt at Komenda with gold-traders from the interior, the Akani ('Arcany', 'Arcania').<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-421"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-421""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-202"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-421"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>
<p>The Dutch West Indian Company also maintained a factory in Komenda throughout this period, which is frequently referred to in this correspondence.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-422"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-422""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-203"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-422"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>6</sup></a></span> The French Guinea Company also made attempts to establish itself in this area, both at Komenda itself and at Ampeni ('Ampena'), a few miles to the east. A French request to establish a factory at Komenda in March 1686 was refused by <span id=""page76"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-423"">pg 76</span></span>the local authorities (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197262528.book.1/actrade-9780197262528-div2-153#actrade-9780197262528-milestone-439"">nos 150–2</a>); and a factory established at Ampeni in January 1687 was attacked and destroyed by African forces from Mina allied to the Dutch (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197262528.book.1/actrade-9780197262528-div2-219#actrade-9780197262528-milestone-557"">nos 216</a>, <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197262528.book.1/actrade-9780197262528-div2-224#actrade-9780197262528-milestone-565"">221</a>). A more sustained attempt to establish factories at both Komenda and Ampeni was initiated by the French expedition under Du Casse in November 1687 (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197262528.book.1/actrade-9780197262528-div2-303#actrade-9780197262528-milestone-705"">nos 300ff</a>), provoking Dutch counter-measures which culminated in an invasion of Komenda, again by Mina forces operating in the Dutch interest, in April 1688, which forced the evacuation of both the English and the French factories there. The Mina were also allied in this attack with a dissident chief of Eguafo, called 'Tagee' (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197262528.book.1/actrade-9780197262528-div2-316#actrade-9780197262528-milestone-748"">nos 313</a>, <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197262528.book.1/actrade-9780197262528-div2-323#actrade-9780197262528-milestone-765"">320</a>). These events left Dutch influence, for the moment, paramount in Komenda, enabling them to build a fort in Komenda.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-424"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-424""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-204"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-424"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>

You writt me that Mr Nightingale did not allow more than a few old knives, which I believe by his account does not appear so. They tell me here it was allwayes paid at Anamaboe, and Mr Hassell not as well paying of it in his time I believe has been the meanes of this pallavera. It is only a case of rumme, and if they demand it again there must be no contending, so hope it will be allowed.

Then for slaves which were bought for sayes, you are pleased to say that I know they are rated att 1oz in barter, which I aver I know no such thing or that ever I was orderd so, except for corn, which indeed I have formerly wrote orders for.

To what you mention concerning the charges in my last accompt, I can assure you, there is nothing brought to accompt, but what was necessary, and hath duly been paid, as may be maid appear; as also those slaves in sallary which you are displeased at, I know of none but what have been allowed the same since my taking charge. If you are pleased to peruse my former accompts you will find the same, and to be without them is a thing impossible. In answer to those that we sent up to you in both the sloops, I acknowledge none but those that went in the Alligator, for those sixteen men, fourteen women were those that were put ashore by James Bayly, and so returned him againe, but a slave may be well to day and sick tomorrow, they are subject to mortallity as well as whites. However I mind what you advise, so shall follow. The Dutch Company shipp is gon from Alampo, with 504 Negroes. The remayns of her cargo were all put ashore here, being sheets, says, and fine sletias. It hath been a great hinderance to those says you sent last, the Blacks esteeming theirs better than ours.

We have orderd the rum cask to be made less than those now sent on Captain Hobbs, and had you mention'd the size you would have them of they should have been so made. We could gett but two hogsheads of white sugar ready for Captain Hobbs, the other two hogshead are very good Musco[vado] sugar, which we are told will sell well with you.

<p>Yours of the 10<sup>th</sup> instant came safe to hand with the things therein mentioned. Since understanding a vessell is arrived you from Europe, occasions this canoe's going up to informe you off our wants of the severall sorts of goods and materialls for Castles us, as per inclosed. If any arrived, you will be pleased to furnish us with the same, by the sloop or other convenciencyes.</p>
<p>As to the purchasing of slaves I refuse none that come that are good, although now are very scarce. Our being not supplyed as per note is a great hinderance. The Dutch Company shipp of which you write is not very forward, having bought but 90 since her being at Olampo, which with 104 received from their ffactory here is 194 now on board her. God knows after this rate how long she may be purchasing her complement of 600.</p>
<p>Your letter to Doctor Walber have delivered. It is grat satisfaction to me you know him, and no wonder he'l abuse me (as he hath don), as long as he doth to his and my betters, from whom he hath received more kindness than deserved. It is not long some time past he struck one of the Company slaves, the most necessary man in the Castle, a carpenter, with an iron shovell, wounded him on the side insomuch that the blood came from his mouth. After having comitted the same error, and having given him a small reproband [= reprimand] for so doing, did desire him to see him cured, [he] would not but most inhumanely replyed if he dyed could but pay for him, an answer not fitting to give me. This is the very reason of the falling out betwixt him and me, and upon that accompt turned him from my table or presence. I had sent him up some time past, had he not sent me the submission inclosed, acknowledging in order in a future amendment. I wonder he should write you to depart this place, when it is plainly appeared his inclination is to the contrary. This is like his abuseing me behind my back, but in my hearing in company [with] the soldiers a thing he denied, but ass sure to be true. What shall I say, he is a man of two tongues.</p>
<p><span id=""page303"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1640"">pg 303</span></span>As to his difference with Mr Price, I have called them both to accompt, being for past quarrels betwixt them, when I was up at Cabo Corso, but now renewed. I cannot understand the right, for one says one thing, the others says another, and for my part I have not reason to beleive one of them, being very well satisfied is a great lyer. I must advise you that the Danes have inquired for an answer of their letter per the 17 hand canoe. The Generall is very sick of a fflux, and in danger of his life. There is great liklyhood to be warr betwixt Ahenesa and the Anguinas. I wish they would fight and make an end, I am sure they spoyle the trade. Having not else, only desire to be furnished if possible with those goods and materialls, staying for them, being things much wanted towards the repayring the Castle.</p>

I have according to your orders supplyed James Bayly with goods and all necessaryes as this place affords, finding him here yesterday morning at my arrivall on that accompt, his vessell lying at Labordee.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1611"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1611""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-551"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1611"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>61</sup></a></span> I also received his slaves from him, being all 59, so that he has left us some thing threadbare with goods and plenty with slaves, having upward of one hundred and odd slaves in the Castle. I could wish a speedy delivery of them, which I hope you Gentlemen will effect as soon as possible, expecting your orders for the same, which when perused shall follow in all particulars. Wee are mightily put by of late by the Dutch, whose fresh supply of all sorts of goods proves a great hindrance to us and drawes the natives from our procuring what [ms 'wth'] we desire. I have here inclosed a note of our wants; I know sundry sorts of them are not by you, being only to give you an insight, but what is with you pray send, it will be a great means in provoking a trade, which endeavours shall not be wanting by me in any wise. Wee also stand in need cartridge paper and all sorts of things belonging to the gunners stores, some rivetts and forelocks for the slaves irons, likewise two clinch hammers, two cold chissells, two punches, and for the repairing of the Castle, the rains having been so furious as you are sensible has occasioned much damage, a bricklayer would be very necessary here, especially to arch the gate, having only a Negroe to help us, who understands no such worke.</p>
<p>I shall follow also your desires as to my monthly accompts, which shall be sent up as possible. James Bayly made his return this morning for Olampo. If he should want any more goods as per inclosed wee have not wherewithall to supply him, therefore once more desire you to furnish us with what you have of the said contents as possible. Our people some of them are very bad in health, most especially our Doctor. I hope God will restore them their health again.</p>
<p>[PS] A ship in sight, suppose to be Captain Thompson.</p>
<p>[PPS] The Dutch expect a ship every day out of Holland, which ship Monsieur Depalmas is ordered (when she comes) for Olampo to procure slaves. The factor here is providing for her in the interim.</p>

If you will please to inspect the inventory you may see many dommaged [sic] goods, which you will all grant I cannot mend, butt my care shall be to preserve them. They have been twice taken downe and brusht, which is as Mr Walker sayes more than was done in 6 months before, and shall bee every month, and oftner if nessesity requires.

Eight lusty men Negro slaves are run away, which I am in hopes to gett againe, understanding w[h]ere they are sheltered, Ahenisha having promised to see them returned. My misfortune hapened in the manner ffollowing.

The Serjeant did, but not with that discretion as he ought to have done, sends ten of the lustiest men in said irons with but two Bomboys. The slaves when they came to the plase assigned them and found their advantage, they seized the said Bumboyes, and wounded one of them in the back, and by chance of 10 Negroes that went out 2 came back againe, one of them being also wounded, which I send you per the bearer. Slaves now are growne very scarse. What comes the country people will have what they list, and without I comply, you cant expect noe slaves. The goods that came per this conveniency I received. The bailes of pautkaes I opened before Mr Bayly, thirty six of them are much damaged, occasioned by the rubbing of the said bailes. The sheets you sent are all disposed, soe wee want more, a greater quantity, as also broad niccanees. I wrote you last concerning oyster shells and Serjeants pay. Noe more at present, only wishing you all a merry Christmas.</p>

The reason I know not, unlesse I would give them all the Royall Companyes concernes. They daily pretend to new customes due to them, and that it has been paid by all my predecessors. I have by their continuall and unjust demands so much drained my whole small stock, and all for my Royall masters interest and safety of their concerns, that I am not able to lanch any fartther in the vast ocean of the unsafe forcible and unsatiable people. They demanded three cases of spiritts, besides half a barrell of powder. If it will or your pleasure is to allow it pray signify it to me.

These things happening thus has put me to great charges, for I was forced to pay to the army half a barrell of powder and eight gallons rum, and towards the Kings buriall a stript carpett, two sheets, and eight gallons of rum more, which they sayed had ever been allowed them upon the like occasions, and I find if I had denied them it I should have brought a worse trouble upon my self, among such people as these are. I have not brought any of this to accompt, but humbly advise, hoping you will be pleased to allowe the charge, or at least some part of it. I had in a chest of sheets forty six which were very much damnified, by salt water. I have disposed of twenty one, at ta6 per piece, and for the rest I can get nothing, so have sent up twenty five, judging they may serve for the Doctor, or some other use, for here they will turn to no accompt at all.</p>

Daniell Coapeman will tell you the same.

<p>The RAC factory at Egya ('Agga'), east of Anomabu, had been occupied, apparently continuously, since the 1670s. It supplied gold, corn for the provisioning of slave ships, and some slaves. As at Anashan and Anomabu, the hinterland traders bringing gold to Egya were the Akani.</p>
<p>Like Anashan and Anomabu, Egya belonged to the state of Fante, and the factory periodically had dealings with the 'Braffo' of Fante. The Egya correspondence throws further light on Fante's relations with its neighbours, including its war with Agona in 1687 (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197262528.book.1/actrade-9780197262528-div2-658#actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1377"">nos 651</a> etc.) and its projected invasion of Fetu, in support of the exiled chief 'Ahen', in 1688 (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197262528.book.1/actrade-9780197262528-div2-663#actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1385"">nos 656</a> etc.).</p></div>

There is great quantityes at Aquamboe, but Ahenesah being gon from from thence to Winnebah with his army, with an intent, as advised you before, so that these people he has left behind him are only old men, women and children, who are afrayd to come downe, for fear of being panyard by the Anguynas. That litle as comes downe I buy, but to give you a certaine time to procure such a number as you advise, it is impossible for me to advise you, although I have a promise, from one of Ahenesah's Cabushiers, whom he left behind to order his affaires at home, (but tis onely his bare word). As I find how many chests are brought in in a week, I shall know how long time it will be before I can answer your expectation, which I shall not miss any oppertunity of acquainting you.

<p>I have by the bearer hereof sent down my January account with four marks, four ounces, seaven angles and four taccoes of gold being the ballance thereof. I received your Worships letter of the 29<sup>th</sup> January mentioning what fresh goods were come over for Cabo Corso, but by reason of a bad trade have no occasion for any here. Captain Bristow said he had an order from your Worship to put six chest of sheets ashore here, but haveing so many of the last that was sent me remayning I refused them, my trade being dull. From the time of my sending for powder to the end of the month, I took but five ounces of gold, and yet not above a week before they were mad for powder and cleared the Dutch of all theres, so that my trade is such a lottery I know not what to advise for, for they are eager for a sort of goods, just as I send for them, I am not certain they will vend when they come upp. The Antea people say the war lyes betwixt Wassaws and Idooms spoils trade and the cuntrey people say it is the unjust dealings of the Antea people, so that what with one and with [ms. 'wt'] the other I have small encouragement when it is like to be better. What [= that] the upland warr hinders I know, but I am certain the Antea make it worse for there came a man and bought five peas in goods at our factory and the town panyard it from him, which is a common trade amoung them and [they] some times sell the traders two [= too] for a slave, which makes them afraid <span id=""page42"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-244"">pg 42</span></span>to come down. I would have gott leave of the Antea to have sent up the cuntrey with some dashes for the upland Cabushers to se if I could have made trade better or elce to have had better sattisfaction to the contrary, but they would nither consent to my goeing or sending any body and to offer it without their consent were a vaine attempt, for they would certainly doe him a mischeife. The person I have now sent down with my accompts is Hastings Ingram, who being to civilly used groweth upon my kindness and doth not behave himselfe of late as he ought to doe [ms. 'does'], he says he came of great freinds, and upon that I suppose he thinks himselfe to be to good to be under my command, his behaviour being more like a master than servant and canot show me less respect than he doth, without he should tell me playnly he is my fellow, perhaps he hath been a better man than ever I shall, yet now I think he ought to be so, so long as I am placed by your Worship as his master, so humbley desire your Worship to give him a check or elce detain him and send another man in his room which your Worship shall think fit to doe.</p>

This serves to give your Worship an account of our tedious voyage from Cape Lopas to the Island of Barbadoes, in which passage we lost one hundred and twenty three Negroes. The small pox proved extreamly fatall, with which distemper we lost the greatest part. Are now fitting our ship for a return and hope to be dispatch'd in a months time. I give your Worship thanks for the recommendation you were pleas'd to oblidge me with to Mr Hardin, from whom I have received all the immaginable kindness that could be expected. I suppose you have understood of Mr Carters leaveing the bills of loading behind him, which we found in the ship. I have sent them by Mr Hobs. I shall procure your Worship some Medera wine and sugar, the first very hard to be had if good. I am glad to hear of your Worships health per Captain Ware, who arriv'd to leward of the island last night. We have noe news of Captain Browses ship, wee left her at St Thoma. No news from England.

Here is not 50 fighting men in Annamabo and all the adjacent crooms, and till such time as they return cannot expect any corn. I beleive shall not take so much mony this month as will sattisfie charges. I purpose today to goe to Annishan and agree for two or 300 chests and so to have it sent of to the ship that shall next come, if it stands with your approbation, pray by return of the messenger a word, but I would willingly have the old corn aboard first, for if he has the new corn he'l hardly take the old and when that is gon I shall have roome enough for 1000 chests more, for I dare not mix new with old.</p>

<p>As was noted in the Introduction, a considerable number of the letters in the Rawlinson corpus (144 of 998 in 1686–8) were received from RAC vessels trading along the African coast (and in two cases, <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197262528.book.1/actrade-9780197262528-div4-78#actrade-9780197262528-milestone-2041"">nos 901–2</a>, from Barbados, in the West Indies) rather than from its factories established on shore. Many of these appear to be from vessels based locally in West Africa, engaged in coasting voyages to both east and west of Cape Coast Castle: characteristically, these were smaller craft, generally described as 'sloops', though one is termed a 'pink'.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1867"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1867""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-683"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1867"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>1</sup></a></span> Only around half come from ships involved in trans-Atlantic voyages, which originated in England and would continue to the Americas. This distinction, however, is not entirely clearcut, since vessels based at Cape Coast sometimes undertook voyages to the West Indies (though returning directly to West Africa, rather than via England), and even ships from England often engaged in the coasting trade, turning back up the coast to the west after arrival at Cape Coast, before proceeding to the Americas. Moreover, the character of particular voyages is sometimes difficult to determine in practice, on the evidence of the extant correspondence alone.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1868"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1868""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-684"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1868"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>
<p>These letters received from ships sometimes supplement those sent by the factories onshore, but in other cases they serve to extend the geographical coverage of the correspondence, to areas where the RAC currently had no factories. In particular, there are several letters in this period from Beraku, in the kingdom of Agona, between Fante and Accra; and from the 'Alampo' (Adangme) country east of Accra. There are also generally sketchier references to trade by RAC ships on the coast to the west of the Gold Coast, in the areas known as the Grain Coast and Ivory Coast (though the latter term does not actually <span id=""page349"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1869"">pg 349</span></span>appear in the Rawlinson correspondence);<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1870"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1870""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-685"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1870"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>3</sup></a></span> and also to the east of the Slave Coast, including Benin, 'the Bight', Gabon and Cape Lopez.</p>

<p>Tis now since the 20 instant, tenn dayes our trade has been stoped, which the country merchants with longing expectations and money in their hands have patiently waited, hoping an accommodation. In the meane time, I hant bene idle with these people here, endeavouring by all the arguments I thought most convenient, and their kind entertainment with what the ffactory affords, to reduce them as formerly.</p>
<p>Upon the reception of yours yesterday I acquainted them of your worships and Councills finall resolution in not allowing any thinge upon soe unresonable demands, and after a longe pallavar, the kings cashe keeper and Mereen being present, thought I had composed the whole affaire, when in the end twas concluded that if I would give them a bendy to drinke all things should be quietly settled, and they would make the country merchants take of those goods that were not as well as those that were vendable. This morning I sent for them againe, and by the assistance of the Mareen and kings cash keeper have made up the pallavar, and the trade is now open and the money coming in as fast as I can take itt, butt they insisted on the same demands as yesterday and I gave them the same answer. The Mereen and other likewise expect a peice for wating here these eight dayes about this buisness; they spoake very well today in the companies behalfe, and told me in privatt that if they some time gave some small dashees among the people, as the Duch doe, wee shold live more quiett without any pallavars if they will play the rogue againe.</p>

<p>Your severall letters per Captain Wood, Captain Poston, Captain Butram and Captain Nanter are now come to my hands, which I take this oppertunity to acquaint you off, having no other means of sending to you but returne of the Coast Ffriggatt, Captain Wood, whose Negroes came in pretty good condition, and yielded [a] price suitable, as they will always doe, that come from your parts, that is to say, from the Gold Coast, if they be well sorted, young and come in a healthy condition, as Captain Butrams also did, which were sold here in a litle time, and at a very high price, but Captain Poston and Captain Nanter had not that good luck, for besides the mortality that was among them, they came so full of the small pox that wee could find no custom for them, even at the lowest rate, so that many of Nanters remayne yet unsold, and it has spread that disease exceedingly in the country to the great damage and discouragement of all future sales of sick and pocky Negroes.</p>
<p>Your not giving me any encouragement to returne Captain Nanter to you, and

By her I send you invoyce and bill of loading for fifty two puncheons, twelve hogsheads and twenty four tierces of rumm, and though it exceeds what you writt for in quantity, yet considering the freight cost nothing, and that every one that comes thence assures me it is a very proffitable comodity for the Company on all the Coast, and being now very good, and at a moderate price, though growing very deare, I was willing to take this oppertunuty of shewing my diligence and care in the Companyes service, and I hope they and you will account it so in this particular. Captain Wood carried himself very well in this voyage, and I hope at his returne to you, will deserve the continuance of your favour to him, and if you see no objection against him, I conceive if you returne the the shipp with slaves he may be fitly trusted with that charge, if you find any error in his accompts, as to seamens wages or otherwise, you will be better able rectifie it, by your books, than I could here, though I hope there is no error in it, though I have by me the papers you sent me thereto relating.</p>
<p>I have spoke to Captain Nanter about the error that happened in your accompts with him to your damage, upwards of two ounces of gold.

<p>This which comes to your hands by means of a Ffrench mans boate, being the first opertunity we have meet withall since our departure from Cabo Corso; this is to give you a short account of what trade we have had from thence to this place. We turned up along shoar as high as Dickecove but took no mony, and finding it not possible by reason of the strong current to turne aboute the Cape, we stood to sea, and fell into windward of Cotterue. The first place of trade was Cap[e] Lahoe, where I bought about eleaven hundred weight of elephants teeth; from thence traded down along shoar, at Bassam, Ashenee, and other places, but found gold to be scarse and goods at very low rates. We have been here this six days and have taken in all six markes of gold. There is noe place of trade between this and Cape

<p>Your Worships letter per Mr Chambers is received with the cloth for the Braffo of Taggarado which I shall deliver per first opertunity. As for goods I desire your Worship would be pleased to send me 6 or 10 chests of sheets, one case more of Guine stuffs, one case of paper brawles; also blew perpetuanoes and broad tapseiles, of which I have not nominat'd a quantity, not knowing what supply was in the Castle. Also pewter juggs and brass pans hath been inquir'd for, of which desire a dozen or two to se how they will vend. I made a bad month of May for want of part of these goods, but hope to make a better of this, being supplied with these goods this month; and being part of the rains over, and waters abated up the cuntrey, I doe expect a reasonable good trade, from the Ancorsa people, whose cheif trade is for these goods and powder if sold for an ounce per barrell, otherwise the Dutch will take that from me, but from the Idooms little is expected at present, they being still at difference with the Wassaws. Cophe is come down with the cano, but I was forced to pay him the last two months before he would goe, which I did to avoid mistrust, for he is very subtill, and if he had mistrusted in the least he would a brought the Capushers in a pallaver and pretend'd they would not lett him goe, also he demanding after my account was made up I could not charge it, so must defer it tell June account.</p>

<p>This accompanys Mr Chambers, who is come down according to your Worship order. I went down this morning to Captain Assum to know what answer they would return your Worship about the pallaver, the which I perceive I am like to doe noe good about, their desireing time being only to drive it of to se if you would bury it in oblivion, for they make a palaver that the man came not to rob the factory but to dig for gold as he pretended at first, that he panyard the slaves because we shot him for nothing, and they told me in short that the man was run away and when he could be found again he should be examined whether he came to rob us or noe, and that was all the answer they said they could give me, upon which I made them answer that as they had made a promis upon the first panyaring of our slaves, to deliver the ofender to me within eight dayes and have not done it, that they had taken the pallaver upon their one [= own] heads, and they ought to make good our losses, and as they had been short in their answer your Worship would be as resolute to have satisfaction, on which they made noe answer, but had the grace (though they will not give sattisfaction) to demand their dues, and tell me their danceing time is ten dayes hence and their was a dashe from the Company, so I would desire your Worship to send me word what is to be given on that account. I have not taken above three mark of gold yett this month besides charges, I haveing the ill fortune still. As the traders come down they want those goods I am out of, they being so fickell minded, that I know not what to advise for except I have a full supply of all sorts, for somtimes goods shall lie buy me two months and not be asked for and of a suddain they would be gon if I had never so many, therefore I would desire that favour of your Worship once to be at the c[h]arge of a cano with these goods hereafter mentioned except any of them be on board the sloop allready, and for the future I will give more timely advice what is wanting, for the sloop is now arriv'd and I have been in want of severall of those goods I have advised for this month. The goods I am in want of is vizt 10 chests of sheets, one hundred narrow nicconees, forty green Welch playns, and as many course sletias, and for blew perpetuanoes and broad tapseiles as many as can be spared me, twenty brass pans and pewter jugs, forty half firkins tallow, one case of Guine stuffs, also rum for I spend all [so] that I was forced to buy of the Dutch brandy to give away.

<p>Yesterday I sent a canoe off to the French man to discover what he might be, but they would not suffer the Blacks to go aboard, not upon offer to trade with them. This morning I sent againe, and the Blacks had admittance, but not to come nigh the cabin door, which was guarded with two musquittes, a thing not usuall on board honest merchant men, nor will they sell any goods for gold, but offer to barter for slaves. Those circumstances do perswade me that he is a rogue, and I have given Captain Buttram notice of it, by returne of the message. I understand that you have sent 20 men to his assistance, which I am glad off, for he cannot be too secure. If you please to give me any instructions they shall be duly observed.</p>

If I could tell in what, I would strive to amend it and shall for the future avoid inserting any thing but what is the Company concerns. I did not imagine anything in mine could be taken for flattery in the least. The putting up the fittish at the gate was on this wise: the Braffo and Quarranters had sent for powder and shott, which I denyed thinking it but frivilous and that it had been no such thing; the next day without any notice to me the Fittisherers came and put it up, forbiding on pain of their displeasure any man to trade for corn or goods &amp;ca before I could advise you of itt, [and] denyd any sustenance to supply us, and rather than want provitions, and fearing itt would increase by neglecting to grant their demands, I paid it. I canot learn that I was in any wayes impossed on, they are so insolent now that a man can hardly stand sentinell at the gate but they affront him one way or another without the least occasion in the world. I had not mentioned any thing about Yabboy had I not been importuned by him, and for the future I will not meddle or make any more with other mens business of that nature. <span id=""page197"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1097"">pg 197</span></span>If these ships have brought perpetuanoes, sheets and tallow I desire your Worship to send me some.

<div class=""div2 prelim editorial""><a name=""actrade-9780197262528-div2-387""></a>
<p>The RAC's principal establishment on the Gold Coast after Cape Coast Castle itself was at Anomabu ('Annamaboe' etc. in these documents), east of Anashan, and like it situated within the state of Fante ('Fanteen'). The Anomabu factory had been fortified earlier in the 1680s, and was known as Charles Fort — though this name occurs only occasionally in the correspondence for 1686–8. The other RAC factories within Fante, Egya ('Agga') to the east as well as Anashan, were subordinate to it. The Anomabu factory supplied principally gold, but also corn for the provisioning of slave ships, and some slaves. The principal hinterland traders bringing gold to Fante, including to Anomabu, were the Akani.</p>
<p>The Dutch West Indian Company also had a factories in this area, at Mouri ('Morea') to the west of Anashan, and at Kormantin ('Cormanteene') to the east of Egya, which both are occasionally referred to in the Anomabu correspondence. The correspondence also records an attempt by the French Guinea Company to settle in the area towards the end of 1687, at Anashan (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197262528.book.1/actrade-9780197262528-div2-578#actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1224"">nos 572–4</a>) and at Amisa ('Amersa), east of Kormantin, (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197262528.book.1/actrade-9780197262528-div2-583#actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1233"">nos 577–8</a>, <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197262528.book.1/actrade-9780197262528-div2-586#actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1245"">580–1</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to records of trade, much of the correspondence relates to negotiations and disputes between the RAC factory and the local political authorities, mainly over the payment of 'customs', or customary gifts; such disputes forced the removal of two successive chiefs of the factory, James Nightingale in September 1686 and Ralph Hassell in August 1687. The Anomabu correspondence also refers occasionally to relations between Fante and neighbouring states, notably a war against Akyem ('Ackim') and Agona ('Anguina') to the east in 1687, and a projected war against Fetu to the west in 1688 — the latter in support of an exiled chief of Fetu called 'Alien'.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-878"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-878""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-340"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-878"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>

<p>My last was by a canoman of Annamabo named Annomah, who promised to depart from Popo in 2 or 3 dayes at farthest. He seemed to be a mighty honest fellow, but now I here he is not yett gone, and the reason he did not goe [was] the Mind [= Mine] people perswaded him his cano was to little, and therefore stay till they went. I have [sent] up for the letter by reason one of Captain Nanters bills of loading is [blank]. Sometimes the canomen will not go till such a time, and sometimes they will goe from hence and stay a month or two at Poppo, which is a great vexation to me and have been ever since I came here, and your letters have been like Jobs comforters. I give you this relation that you may not think any negligence in mee.</p>
<p>It was debated in England by the Company whether I, as being then ordered Cheife for this place, should have a dependance from Cabo Corso Castle or not, <span id=""page340"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1826"">pg 340</span></span>and twas concluded I should. The reasons given me, that in case of want of any supply I could have spedier recours to Cabo Corso than to England, both by the advice boat was sent with me and the often returning of canoes, which was sattisfactory reason.</p>
<p>But now I perceive I shall have no supplyes, not such as may maintain Factory expence. Where the fault lyeth, I know not I am sure tis not in me. If the Company hath given orders to the contrary, tis but just I should know of it. For all the loss of lives, for all the unnecessessary expence, if any, tis occasiond by the Company, for I did not move the Company to come here, only to spend their mony; but it was otherwise proposed to me, and for that reason the Company required a double security of a private Factor, and allowed me double the sallery, with a promis of advance.</p>
<p>I am at the same expence, as if all the ships were consigned to my selfe, except the brandy for expending in buying of slaves, and that often lyeth parte upon mee too. Gentlemen, by the inclosed account you may perceive what quantity of goods remayn in the Factory, and that I have just cause to complayne; and if you will not please to send me no more I will doe my best endeavour to maintain the honour of the Royall Companys Factory here with what goods I have of my one [= own] and other peoples in my hands till I depart hence, which I hope in God may not be long, my three years being past considerable.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1827"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1827""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-656"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1827"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>68</sup></a></span> I will ask only God almighty's blessing for a fair opertunity and his good providence to protect me safe from this fatall and unfortunate place of Ardra.

They came ashore ill and went directly up to the Kings Town, and lay one night, but was ill very bad, after that they went both on board againe.</p>

I told him at his comeing first ashore that if please God weather permitted he should have his slaves in 10 or 12 dayes at farthest. He was but one or two nights ashore in all and he was so much my freind that he had been 200 if occasion had required. His welfare and health was so esteemed by me that I would have hazard my health and life to have preserved his.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, beleive me to be so much a Christian that I abhor the thoughts of doeing or suffering any injury to be done by to my freind. It is more then I would have done to the worst enimy I have.</p>
<p>If any such words have been utterd I beleive my man Unguah, who is kindred to Say, hath been the occasion, by reason I will not have him come down againe, hath wrought this forregery. I doe beleive formerly when our house was green, being now [= new] built, it might be a little unwholsome, but now as it is I am confident tis as wholesome as any house in the cuntrey, and as convenient and as moderate drinking.</p>

<p>As to Doctor Wolber, in short he is more a beast than a Christian, and has so many tricks that he is able to set up all by the ears, and ruine all the Royall Companys concernes here, or any where elce, without he be kept under, and if you Gentlemen did but see the hundredth part of his moross and unbecoming actions, you would not blame me, nor any in that station you were pleased to put me in, to keep him under a good and lawfull comand, as hitherto have don, and Gentlemen you yourselves are sensible of his tricks at Cabo Corso, Accra, aboard the Mary, and since his last coming downe. Had like to bring a great difference between Mr Everars and my selfe per his reports, which after a strict examination found to be falce, before all our garrison. I am afrayd that one time or another he will occasion great trouble per the Blacks, if not betray the ffort. Have not received any corne, all the people are with Captain Eggin and [= at] Saboe. I intend to go there tomorrow, in order to have corne brought downe as soon as possible, I find that sending of others signified nothing. I humbly begg you will be pleased to have patience till I can get it in. If the people were downe could soon be supplyed with a great deale of ease, which hope you will be pleased to grant. Should without writing let Mr Cross have the 5 hand canoe, for wee always let one another have what wee want. Have sent Dr Wolber this morning to Agga, The old Gentleman there is very sick.</p>

<p>The 1686–8 correspondence also differs from that of 1681–3 in including some letters received from representatives of foreign companies trading on the West African coast, the Dutch West Indian Company and the Danish African Company. Obviously, such letters must also have been received earlier, but were not then copied into the Cape Coast letter-books. There is no evident rationale to their inclusion or non-inclusion, which presumably reflects merely different instructions given at different periods to the Company's clerks. These letters are all recorded in English, but there is no indication whether they were originally written in that language, or translated from Dutch on receipt at Cape Coast.</p></div>

I told them that in my judgement it were verry good, and that if they would depend on their owne opinion before mine, wee would be tryed by neither, but that they should take the said gold sealed up and goe to Caboe Corsoe, and soe refer to your better judgements, but Curry refused the thing and tooke the gold, the other continued obstinate, and giving mee very absurd language, saying that his covenants with the Royall Company is not fulfilled, and if all men were of his opinion they would lay downe their armes, and lett the Company come here and keep their fforts theirselves, for they have putt a cheat upon men, and if occasion should serve, he would serve them accordingly. The gold which denyed have now sent up, and is the same Mr Walker gave him, haveing sealed these in the presence of most here.

<p>This accompanyes the sad news of the death of Mr William Halford, who departed this life aboutt 3 this morning. I have not as yett taken an accompt of his things, only have secured them untill the dispatch of this canoe, which I though[t] fitt to send her wthout delaying of time. I buryed him as becomes one of his station.</p>
<p>The following is a coppy of a letter sent you by the Adventure Sloope, James Baily Master, who had his dispatch yesterday morning. By reason wind would not permitt could not stir. By him goes the ballance of my two last accompts, makeing in all mk2 1o 9a 1ta, and the quantity of sixty negroe slaves, vizt 30 men, 30 weomen, with all things convenient for their passage up, which hope may prove sufficient. For the remaning part of the negroes our provitions is verry shortt, haveing butt 14 chests of damaged corne for their substinance. I have for some time (for want of the same) refused the buying any more [i.e. slaves], which thing I feare will prove a great disapointment to the Marys slaveing off the Coast. Now are to be had, but not to be bought. Here is noe trade for gould, I have not taken one angle this tenn dayes; the Ducth [sic] being supplyed with our wants draws all from us. Their ship from the Mina is dayly expected down in order to her dispatch. Wee have lost more slaves of the small pox. One was this day from James Baily, being newly taken with the same.</p>

By the retturne of the same, is to sattisfie you that according to your order shall dispatch James Bayly with what slaves he can conveniently carry, which believe may be 60. I am sorry you cannot suply us with corne. Wee shall be forced to put on board the sloope the major part [sc. of corn] now remaining; having tacken well, as tould you before, will not goe halfe soe farr as better, which makes the expence of corne the greater, and for the maintenance of those slaves remaining after Mr Bayly have taken the said complement, will be about thirty, what to doe for them I know not, here being no manner of provitions for their substenance, unless wee buy fish and give them halfe allowance in caneky.</p>

<p>The RAC factory in Hueda ('Whydah', 'Whiddah', 'Whidah') had been established in 1682, superseding an earlier factory at Offra, in the kingdom of Allada ('Ardra' etc.) to the east.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1735"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1735""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-595"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1735"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>1</sup></a></span> In 1682–3. the RAC's factory had been in Savi, the royal capital of the Hueda kingdom, about 6 miles inland;<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1736"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1736""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-596"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1736"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>2</sup></a></span> but by 1685, as is clear from the first letter in this correspondence, it had been moved to the village of Glehue (modern Ouidah), situated to the north of the lagoon which runs parallel to the coast.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1737"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1737""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-597"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1737"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>3</sup></a></span> An English interloper called Petley Wybourne had also established a factory at Glehue in Whydah, and he was still there, trading in competition with the Company at the beginning of this correspondence (cf. <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197262528.book.1/actrade-9780197262528-div2-821#actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1741"">no.812</a>), but early in 1686 he was forcibly removed by the RAC's agents, and deported back to England.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1738"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1738""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-598"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1738"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>4</sup></a></span> However, in 1687 Wybourne came to an agreement with the RAC to serve as their own agent in Whydah, and he arrived there, as reported in this correspondence, at the beginning of 1688. The Whydah factory was principally important for slaves, but there is also some reference in this correspondence to the possibility of trading for locally made cloth, which Europeans purchased for resale on the Gold Coast (nos <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197262528.book.1/actrade-9780197262528-div2-821#actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1741"">812</a>, <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197262528.book.1/actrade-9780197262528-div2-831#actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1809"">821–2</a>).</p>
<p>The French Guinea Company also maintained a factory at Whydah throughout this period, while the Dutch West Indian Company had one at neighbouring Offra to the east, both of which are occasionally mentioned in this correspondence.</p>
<p>Correspondence between the Whydah factory and Cape Coast Castle was evidently more irregular than with the other factories on the Gold Coast. The reason for this is evident from this correspondence, in which the Whydah factor complains repeatedly of his difficulties in getting African canoes to carry messages to the Gold Coast, while the small RAC vessels based at Cape Coast <span id=""page323"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1740"">pg 323</span></span> did not normally return directly up the coast, but went east to Cape Lopez in Gabon and then west through the open sea to reach the coast west of the Gold Coast, so that any letters sent by such ships would be long in transit.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1739"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1739""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-599"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1739"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>5</sup></a></span> In addition to details of trade locally, the Whydah correspondence also throws some light on RAC and other European trading along the coast to the west, at Keta ('Kitto'), Little Popo and Great Popo; in particular a unique and invaluable detailed account of a visit by the RAC factor at Whydah to Little Popo in 1687 (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197262528.book.1/actrade-9780197262528-div2-835#actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1836"">no.825</a>).</p>

He sent then two women full of the small pox (which are in the number), the one dyed in the voyage coming up, the other shall take all care possible to restore her to health, I examined his canoemen whether the slaves on board were most men or women, they replyed he never bought women without men. He may be I judge half way between Olampo and here by the time of his departure, which was the 18<sup>th</sup> instant. The land breezes are far out and last not long, which will make his passage long ere he turn up.

When wee first gave chase to the shipp wee was off of Butterue, and in the morning when wee left him wee was abreast the Mina 7 leagues off, and that day with a fresh sea brees gott up to Taccarado, but now have such stronger leeward currants, and little winds, that makes me feare that I shall not be able with soe heavy a sayler to gett up to Ashine in your days appointed per order.

I understand that the Adoomes got togather in a small party, and did much damage to some of the Warshaw people, the Addoomes being disperst in the woods. The Warshaws have invited this townes people to take of them what they can, [so] that wee have now very few people in the towne and at present here is no trade for slaves or money. As yet I cannot add to the moneys that was taken when Mr Ronan and Mr Price were here, only one man slave, which you shall receive with my March accompts and what elce shall purchase to the end of this month. In your next be pleased to order, if shall draw this months accompt from the primo March, or from the 10<sup>th</sup> ditto.

I shall do what I can to satisfie the ballance of my former accompts, and shall obey your order in sending it with the accompt, but what I had, and what I have taken, was [paid] to the soldiers, being now out of pockett about 5oz of gold, for the Royall Company, and at present have hardly any to buy provitions. According to your order I asked Captain Lomax for the charges of canoe hyre, that is two canoes to Cabo Corsoe and one to Dickiscove, being in all 8a on his accompt, which money he refused to pay, only the first canoe to Cabo Corso Castle, and tells me he will discourse it with <span id=""page71"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-393"">pg 71</span></span>you. By this canoe you will receive one Samuell James, a soldier, for some time residing in this place and for some time since my coming here has been very refractory in this ffortt, by his behaviour and language, and yesterday being the 20<sup>th</sup> ditto abused me very much with a great many curses and oaths, and also threatned mine and others lives that were then in the Fort. To execute his intent got a large cutlas in the night at sentinell with him, on the topp of the house, and said, who ever came there, he would cutt him in peeces or shoot him, at which time, being not his watch, I understanding this, demanded his armes, which he refused, but by force of soldiers disarmed him and for myne and others security, put him in irons, he being still desperate, and fearing he would do mischief to some of the soldiers that lay in the room where he was, I put him into the slaves prizon, and also [he] said he would bring blacks, and beate us all out of the Castle, also said that I had put him in irons as a slave but could not sell him, but bid me have a care he did not sell me, and all the rest, he having severall times before had great conferences with blacks, and in the midle of the night in another mans watch, sets open the doores of the Fort, with a great many other bad circumstances, which I have here omitted, thinking it will be tedious to repeate, beleiving this may be sufficient.</p></div></div>"

I made an end as soon as I could and brought away the key of the warehouse [so] that noe other goods should be imbazled, and I fear if I should send Mr Walker there they would doe him a mischief or any one elce, which make mee in truth amazed and require your farther order.

<p>James Fort, Accra, on the eastern Gold Coast, had been occupied by the RAC continuously since the 1670s. There was also a Dutch fort (Fort Crevecour) and a Danish fort (Christiansborg) in Accra, both of which are regularly mentioned in this correspondence. Christiansborg had been pawned to the RAC by its commander in 1685, but it remained in the possession of the Danish company; eventually, following negotiations in Europe, the English claim to it was renounced.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1470"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1470""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-491"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1470"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>1</sup></a></span> The correspondence also refers to an attempt by the French expedition under Du Casse in early 1688 to purchase Christiansborg from the Danes, which was opposed by the English on the grounds of their own prior claim to the fort (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197262528.book.1/actrade-9780197262528-div2-800#actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1685"">nos 792</a> etc.). Accra supplied both gold and slaves.</p>
<p>Accra had been conquered in 1680 by the inland kingdom of Akwamu ('Quamboe'),<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1471"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1471""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-492"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1471"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>2</sup></a></span> and remained subject to Akwamu during the period of this correspondence. The king of Akwamu who had carried out this conquest, Ansa Sasraku, was still on the throne during 1686–8, and is frequently referred to in this correspondence ('Ahenesah' etc.).<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1472"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1472""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-493"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1472"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>3</sup></a></span> The trade to Accra was now dominated by Akwamu, the access to it of countries further inland, such as Akani ('Arcanye') and Akyem ('Arkin' etc.) being recurrently disrupted by disputes with Ansa Sasraku.

<p>I wrote you very lately by the Dutch sloope, which was out of sight of land before my cano could gett on board him, [so] that I had noe time to coppie the letter, but think the substance was the same I shall now confirme, being in answer to your last concerning the accommodating the Affrican Pinck with men slaves without bougees, which may be easily be accomplished in the same manner I before mentioned. Affter the major part of his Arda cargo is proposed in suitable goods, haveing not bouges, put a convenient quantity of sallable goods that will purchase gold as she is corning and comeing down, and the produce of those goods will accomplish good men slaves, haveing already discoursed the point here with the king and the whiteman, and the gold will be brought ashore with much less charge and loss then bouges by 4 or 5 slaves in the quantity of booges such a ship requires. If the Pinck should not come down this advise will be good for any other ship that comes from England, if they come with short quantityes of bouges as now they doe, they cannot doe amis in disposeing of any goods unless these most proper goods I now shall mention: rangoes, long cloths, bafts, currall, pintadoes broad, pautkeis. Any other goods they may venture to dispose of for gold, and the gold will doe better then the goods [omission?] quantity of goods and produce in gold. I have here inclosed sent up my last years account, I could not make it up at the halfe years end as accustomary by reason I had not goods to ballance before that came in Captain Woodfine, and now you may see what was remayning some months past and at Christmas. Unless a supply comes down I shall bee ashamed to make up the halfe years account. Since this account have put</p>

Therefore I intreat your Honour and the Gen[t]lemen of the Councill will consider and send down a sufficient supply, for every ship comes short cargoed, and rake [?= take] what they can from me. I have some times 12, 14 or 20 white men a shore, all maintained at the factory and out of my store. Pray amoungst goods for me send more scarlett and red perpetuanoes, but they are not proper in a ships cargo by reason the king is unreasendable [= unreasonable] in the demands of such goods, and tis not the king nor Cabusheers that buy them.</p>

<p>Yours of the 10<sup>th</sup> instant I received and sett our slaves yesterday to breaking of stons as formerly, but today the Dutch has turnd them away pretending the ground and place to be theirs, which I have born with it being your Worships order that I should make no opposition but advise immediately. I have therefore accordingly sent the bearer away, this happening about eleaven a clock this morning. There is no enmity between Mr Ensworth and me as I know of but what is done by order of the Generall of the Mine. Now I suppose if the king of Aguaffo is acquainted with this he will not suffer their proceedings, for he sent and turnd them away once, as I wrote before, but I cant tell what pallaver they may have made with him since, their pretentions are that the place belongs to them as a wattering place and that they are now breaking stones to inclose itt with a wall, but that is only to cheat the black[s], their design being to gett a wall round their houses. It may be convenient that Mr Chambers come up (if your Worship and Councell shall please) and put the building forward, for I beleive theyr are near stones enough broak but the blacks have been very backward in bringing them up. I have hired them for Tuesday next and they have promised all their assistance.</p>

<p>If you are pleased to allow the blacks to chuse the Royall Companys servants, and to send them of at their pleasure, they will have one every two or three months, which will be very hard for any to live without better reasons or objections then they, as the blacks tells me. If you will be pleased to send a Cabushier to discourse them, that the truth may be knowne wherein I have [not?] done any thing, but always endeavored to oblige all the Cabushiers of this towne, as much as possible I could, and have endeavored to encourage trade with them as much as any man, and they never come to the factory, and goe away but they have drams. Having not any one that I can trust to tell them anything, wherein I can be sure they tell the same I speake to them, doe beleive they tell me one thing and the Cabushiers another, which you will be pleased to send a Cabushier, and their customes, and that their may be a right understanding between us, I beleive all things will doe well and the Cabushiers satisfied a greate deale better then now they seeme to be, by reason of a bad interpreter between us.

<p>Whereas on Satterday last, being the 23<sup>th</sup> of this instant July, the Cappusheers of Anamaboe (I then being Chief there) demanded a case of brandy as an accustomary dashee at their new year as they called it, that is at their cutting of their small corn, which at first I denyed to them, and that I know no such custome and that I would be satisfyed first from you whether it would be allowable, by reason I would give no ill presidents [= precedents] for the time to come, their answer was that if it was not accustomary and allowed of by my predecessors and former Agents and if not by you they would pay for it, and on consideracon of <span id=""page212"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1165"">pg 212</span></span>which I did deliver them a case of rume, with which they went out of the gates seemingly well contented. Some small time after they were out of the gate they sent for me to render thanks for the same, and as it was their new year all Chiefs did use to drink with them. Not in the least imagining they had any design or prejudice of ill against me, I did go out. I had not gone six yards from the Castle wall without the gates but presently unsuspectedly a great number of Blacks interveened me and the gate on purpose to hinder mee from returning again, as I since found true. I then went to the Cappusheers, which satt under the wall about 7 or 8 yards farther, they desired me to sitt down, which I did, then they began long storyes, saying that at my going there I promised to be kind to them. I replyed, I never was otherwise. They answered that I would not take cracra mony as others had done before me, and that I would take no pawnes nor trust them,<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1166"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1166""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-409"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1166"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>70</sup></a></span> and that the English men were not so kind to them as the Dutch, for that wee [i.e. English] all loved the Fetuers better than the Ffanteeners, and that the Ffetuers were their enemyes, and that they [i.e. the English] might be better aided at Cabo Corso than at Anamaboe, and that I should not tarry there no longer; to which I made this answer, that I had orders not to take their cracra mony, it was so bad, and if I should take it it would occasion more bad mony to be made and brought to me, which I must make good, and that it behooved me to take none but what was good, and what others had done should not be a president for me. I told them likewise that I could not take pawns, knowing that they do not care to redeem them, and that for severall years Mr Thelwall had pawnes from severall of them and that time the Royall Companyes mony lay dead, and so they would do again if I took any pawnes, and as for trusting of them I had to my losse done to much, which I have made good to the Royall Company, and as to the Dutch loving them better than the English, replyed they had more reason for they were ever treacherous to us, as instance their selling Cormantine from us to the Dutch,<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1167"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1167""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-410"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1167"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>71</sup></a></span> and as for being more kind to the Fetuers, though their enemyes, [they] were more faithfull ever than they, yett for their mony they might be supplyed as as well as they, for they have nothing without money, and what had I done that should so much incense them to that height. They still persisted in the same story, and that I should not go into the Castle again but I should instantly go to Cabo Corso, and that they would strip me naked and beat me as they had Mr Nightingale, unlesse I would send for an anchor of rume. I well knowing that their cruelty infinitely transcends humane apprehensions, condescended to save myself impunified, and that I might go into the Castle again, which they would not permitt unlesse I left Mr Walker behind me as a pawn and that severall of them might enter with me. This was all done under the Castle walls where no damage could be done to them by any gunns, the fort being so ill contrived and so weakly manned that

By the seaventeen hand cano goes forty slaves, 22 men 18 women; could have 50, only hearing Mr Helling at Barracoe had some by him, which he canot so conveniently keep them on board as on shoar, so shall keep the rest untill the return of the said cano, in which time I hope shall provide her another cargoe. Mr Price is very ill, who hath continued so this four dayes of a violent pain in his belly and hard bound withall flies up into his head; God knows what will become of him if no remydy of a doctor, which we canot have here, both Dean and Dutch doctor are trobled with the same distemper. We are also in great want of a Serjant, and for the Castles use a pair of stilliards, a flagstafe and halliards.

If they had belong to any other nation or place elce I might I beleive a gott something out of them. It hath been a custome in former times and I think alwaies till now, and am sure tis alwaies expedient that when a vessell of the Companys is orderd for the Madearahs for wine, to France for brandy, or to Barbadoes for rum, that soon affter the arrivall of such liquors all the ffactoryes use'd to be supplyd with a stock according to their expence, some a butt some more, at the Companys price. Now that I beleive and am inform'd that your Honour is alwayes in action, and therfore your head taken up with many other of the Companys concernes and troublesome bussiness; but I am almost certaine that their is some other heads about you that should be ease to you, are more taken up with pot, boul [= bowl] or glass concernes than anything of the Companys business, and if they can but swill their gutts, will care for none elce, therefore tis my advice when next His Excellency as they call it knights them againe it may be Sir Tymothy Dolittle, Sir Roger Doe Nothing, Sir Andrew Love Nobody, and soe forth, and with this addition, (but drink). Had they been Orambarrowes [sic: =?], I would have excused it. Here for our necessary expense have been forced to give two slaves an ancor for brandy, and canot have enough [even] so, and I think tis reason that these before mentioned knights should pay for this extravagant charge, it being not the Company fault but theirs, for not mentioning such a expedient to your Honour.</p>

I sent down two old casks that came with the corne [which] was given the slaves; but for lime cask here is none, for they were always returnd with the return of the sloop, except one for measureing oystershells. I send down Mays account with one mark ten taccoes of gold, being the ballance thereof, per Mr Innes, which if I had had sheets and Guine stuffs I should have sent 8 or 9 marks, but the sloope arrivd not till they were gon up the cuntrey, but I question not but they will be down shortly, for sheets they bought of the Dutch, but Guine stuffs he could not supply them with, but I hope ere this month be past to have a good trade, for by that time the water will be abaite'd, which I understand are very high up the cuntrey. The goods I shall want is a hundred iron barrs and 6 chests of sheets. Allso if their be any blew perpetuanoes and broad tapseiles, to be spar'd out of the Castle, I desire your Worship to send me what quantity you please. Also powder would sell at one ounce per barrell, otherwise not by reason the Dutch sell it at that rate.

not from me, but indeed [I] have the gratist cause of admiration, first that the Company at my request and desire should buy a small vessell and send her out on purpose and purely for an advice boat from Cabo Corso to this place and to pass and repass, as occasion required and time would permitt, for the better settlement and government of this factory, but since the time I came here niether shee nor any other vessell have sent, though I have been inform'd by severall, that somtimes one vessell was designed to be sent down and other times another, [so] that I did still live in hopes. Now there is three reasons for such a vessell to be sent, first because the Company did order it; secondly because the destruction by fire did request it; thirdly because you did not here from us in soe long time. Twas requested a vessell should have been sent to se in what condition we were in, I mean the factory was in, which might very well be thought to be bad enough after such distraction [sic] by fire and no house to put our heads in but an interloper.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1770"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1770""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-621"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1770"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>33</sup></a></span> Before I came out of England I told the Company we could send advice home with more certainty at some times of the year than to Cabo Corso, therefore desired the said vessell and they granted it.</p>

The last letter I sent you by the canoe was the 10<sup>th</sup> of March last, and that and the former gave you an account that I wanted goods, and you have sent me none since but a little in Captain Lowder.</p>
<p>I have no goods of the Companyes, but am forc'd to make use of the estate of deceas'd persons and my own to maintain the factory, therefore canot make up my account till I am supplyd.

If the George sloope be arrived at Cabo Corso, as I hope she may, I request your Honour will please to order her down, with what goods you please to send downe, and if you can furnish her with 6 or 8 oars for rowing, I will [put] 20 or 30 stout slaves one [= on] board, who will quickly be entstruckt'd to row, which may be a great help to her comeing up. If soe accomplished I would not in the least doubt of getting up in her in 14 or 20 days time, and and I long to se Cabo Corso, therefore hope there will be none soe unkind as to putt a stop, or delay any means, that may tend to soe reasonable happiness. Gentlemen I came out of England in good equipage as to security sallery and great promises from the Company, with a small vessell, called a smack, which was brought and sent out purposely for my use, as Cheife of this factory, well knowing the necessity of such an expedient at this place, now depriv'd of the conveniency of the own [= one] and my expectation being wholly frustrated in the performance of the other, pray doe not mock at my misfortunes, because I am not soe happy as to be at Cabo Corso, where some have had the advantage of rising to greater preferment than they came out for.</p>

<p>It may be you may think I am passionate, but I am sattisfied I have just reason to complaine, but to conclude I hope you will by first conveyance be pleas'd to answer my request as far as the Castle affords, and if the George sloop doe not arrive time enough, then by some other convenient vessell, that she may returne up with account of what state we are in.</p>
<p>I am in great want of white men, haveing only my selfe, Mr Wortley and Mr Smith, and here should be 6 at least. If you please to send any down lett them be good men that will not dey [= die] with laziness. I here Samuell Chambers was comeing, I think he may doe well for own [= one]; since the writeing I have an ill carrecter of Samuell Chambers. What I cant think of to write Mr Wortley will give your Honour to understand. What goods will be sent down, if any is not packt up I desire they may be put up in sheet chests, and will pay the warehouse keeper for them if they are at the accustomed price, which was halfe an angle per chest, then if their be 40 or 50 chests I shall gladly pay for them.</p>

which I hope shall accomplish some small time. In the intrim refer you to Mr Wortley and to your own serious consideration of what I have write.</p>
<p>PS. Since now you may perceive I cannot send up but once a year, if you have not the conveniency of sending down a small vessell please to order down canomen with positive comands to return, that you may have a better account of affaires here.</p>

<p>This accompanyes Mr James Bayly in the Adventure Sloope, from whome I have supply'd the Factory with such goods as are chiefly wanting, only pewter he has none. I have likewise by him sent down twenty eight chests corn, which is all I had by me, the people not being so good as their words in bringing in their corn according to promis, and when they do will give them but little better than strickt measure by a chest out of the warehouse. I shall endeavour to purchase what I can and have hopes of a considerable quantity in a short time, but I partly find they keep up their corn in expectation of raising it, hearing it is very scarse to leward. Mr Chambers desires you would be pleased to send some more slaves with all convenient expedition, which would very much forward our work.</p>

<p>Yours of the 7<sup>th</sup> instant received, and yesterday the Cabushers when they came from Fanten were with me to demand their customary dashes at Christmas, so told them your Worship would allow of none, it being so lately that they had received dashes from others that lived here before me. Their answer was that unless they should be paid as formerly they have been, they will not goe out of the factory but remain where they are, and doe impute it to my fault, that they have not already received it. I desire your Worship would be so kind as to allow it in my time as before, and as you writ they have received sufficient dashes already, they say what was given them before my time was not on account of Christmas, and as itt being customary are resolved they will not loose it, and their demands being so great cannot on my own account allow it, soe desire will consider the dayly troble they put me to. Without they are paid must expect more. They are all now in the factory and put me to great inconveniency, which may be remided if your Worship pleases to grant an order that they may have their demands, which were four ginghams and a Welch playne.</p>

<p>Fort Fredericksburg, east of Cape Coast Castle (and like the latter, situated within the kingdom of Fetu) was originally the headquarters of the Danish African Company (Frederixborg), but had been pawned to the RAC by its commandant in 1684, and taken over by the English company in the following year.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-797"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-797""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-320"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-797"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>1</sup></a></span> The Danish company disputed the validity of the transfer, and negotiated to recover the factory: two letters from the Danish Director-General to the Chief Agents of the RAC relating to the issue, written in 1687, are included elsewhere in this corpus (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197262528.book.1/actrade-9780197262528-div3-55#actrade-9780197262528-milestone-2300"">nos 997–8</a>). In the end, however, in 1688 the Danes agreed to give up their claim to Fredericksburg, in return for further payment; it remained in English hands thereafter, and became known as Fort Royal. Although it had been in English hands since 1685, no correspondence from Fredericksburg is preserved until September 1687, when Ralph Hassell was transferred from Anomabu to take over there.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-798"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-798""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-321"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-798"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Although Fredericksburg did some trading for gold (and once, slaves), as reported in this correspondence, its principal value to the RAC was strategic rather than commercial, since it overlooked and commanded Cape Coast Castle.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-799"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-799""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-322"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-799"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>

<p>There hath been no opportunity that I could find or make since I came here, but I have wrote to Cabo Corso, and I have always by gifts and promises and threats endeavoured to perswade or force the canoomen to returne speedily, and of late in particular Say and them that came in Captain Thomas Woodfine, but by no means would they goe till the hermitan. Now whatever excuse they or any other make or say to the contrary are lyes, and I desire you to believe the certain truth. When Say with the rest of the canoomen that went last up departed from hence, I made them promise and swear that they would not stay above 2 or 3 days at Popo, but notwithstanding they stayed above 3 weekes, and all the reason I could hear was because one Mind canooman that was amongst them would not goe any sooner and then when he did goe it was to serve the Dutch, for the Dutch Chiefe at Offrah paniard a man that stole their flagg and sent him up to Popo to goe for the Mine,<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1813"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1813""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-647"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1813"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>59</sup></a></span> and the whitemen finding no Minde canoe there forced our canoomen to take him in and carry him to their Generall, which they readily obeyed without order or knowledge from me, and I believe the fear of displeasing the Generall of the Mine made them post away with the Negroe, so soon as they tooke him in. They said they had no room for any Negroes here by reason they had 4 shipp canoomen to goe up in their two canoes. All which I leave to your examination why the Cabo Corso canoomen should stand in fear of the Dutch and be always governed by the Mine canoomen. If there be but one Mine canooman amongst 11 or 15 I have always observed that he shall govern the rest.</p>
<p>Captain Nanter arrived here the 26 December and hath 230 slaves on board from hence, and all the rest are in the Factory with 40 more if occasion served.

<p>Last night I received a great abuse from John Cabess for nothing at all, as Mr Bayly can sattisfie; he strick me thrice in the face and once that I fell to the ground, and after all (if he could) would have sent me away. This morning I made the pallaver, calling all the merchants and Cabushers, who all took my part, Cabess haveing nothing to say for himselfe. I told them I would have sattisfaction, which they say I shall; and left it to your worship what to impose, hopeing that if they are not soe good as their words, which I dont much question, you will have an opertunity some time or other to nabb him elcewhere. He pretends to serve the English, and doth quite contrary, but I made him stoop today. This morning likewise I gave the cloth, one halfe to the king and the other to the Ffetera, and a gingham to the kings cheife man, that being what they demanded as a custom upon building, which I thought was best to give than to hinder [ms.

<p>This accompanyes the canoe that came down yesterday, by which I have sent up two men slaves. One is the fellow I wrote of the last of June broke prison, which with great charge have gott him again. These unreasonable people would not lett me have him unlesse I paid three pieze, which I did and hope it will be allowed of. The prison windowes are so rotten that it is not fitt to hold slaves till have a new one made. I am still perplext with this people. Just now came in three of the Quarenteers to demand knives to cutt their small corn, and will not tarry an hour before they have them, so that I am in the dark of what Mr Nightingale paid the last year, for they will have as many this. God send me well from hence, for my patience is quite worn out with them.</p>

<p>These is to give your Worship an account of the excessive rains that hath fallen ever since the 18<sup>th</sup> instant almost continually, it haveing washed the Dutch fort down to the ground last Wednessday morning, which made us very much afraid of ours, we not haveing wherewithall to secure it, but thanks be to God it remayns in safty, Mr Chambers haveing used what means he could to preserve it. We have also used all our lime and tiles [so] that we have not materialls to goe forward, wherefore we desire your Worship would be pleased to send some lime and tiles either by sloop or canoe, with all convenient speed, for fear of further danger, the weather continuing very lowring still.

I humble desire your Worship would be pleas'd to send for Cophee for he is altogether deceitfull that I have noe trust in him, being again[s]t the Company intrest if it stands not with his own, which if he would be true noe man could doe more for their profitt in this place for he bears the whole sway in this town and rules them as he lists, but he is altogether false, therefore I could doe better without him, only I should want an interpreter for the cuntrey people.

<p>Last night per the cano I received both your letters togather with thirty barrells of powder, four chest sheets, three hundred two pound pewter basons, two hundred three pound ditto. The major part of the basons I had mony for, soe hope in a shorte time to send for more of the same commodities, for I doe not hold it discression to send for great quantityes at a tame [= time], for then they will but blow upon goods, and being soe near where I may suddainly be supplyd will cause a greater eagerness in them to take what I have. Bonashee last night sent in a woman slave according as he promised and hopes your Worship will be as good as your word. By this cano I have sent up three men and one woman besides that of Bonishees, also according to your Worships order twenty chests of Annamaboe corne, which I will say is clean, and so is all here or that shall come from hence. The accompts I have sent up all signed by myselfe, and the errors rectified in James Griffins time. I want paper much. This is the ultimate val[u]e of what I have.</p></div></div>"

The messenger that I sent for him tells mee that the house was full att Agga and making pallavers on James Griffin keeping the key, which I order'd him and sent another man there yesterday, not adjudgeing it safe [that] Mr Perrin should have itt any longer by reason he complyed not with promise, and fearing that goods to a greater value might goe to hatch money to make the other good, and having th[o]roughly sifted out the matter I finde more bran them [= then] meale; yett by reason I paste [= passed] my word to Cabushers and likweise to him before them, I would doe him no injury, soe begg you would be as favorable as in equity may bee.

It would in my opinion be verry nessessary that a Chiefe should be there, and not under this place.

My servant tells mee the eleaven hand canoe is a very good new canoe, it was bought out of the country that day he arrived there. The length that he brought mee the measure is full forty nine foot, the breadth four foot. There is a knott in here [= her], just under the stearesmans seat above the watter, otherwise as they

This is the answer I had, which when you have considered off pray send me word whether you will have itt or noe, and whether I shall writte him to proceed for a ffifteen hand canoe, and as you please to order shall send word to Axim. Some small time since two of the white men were taken sick, by which we were disabled to keep watch as formerly. This the Negroes perceiving, made use of the opertunity one night to climb up the hill next the baie and breake open the shutter of the warehouse window, and although the iron barrs stopt them from getting in, yett they made shift by fastaning ffish hookes to stickes and alsoe to lines with a bullett of lead, to heave them into the narrow tapseiles, and by that meanes drew forth eleaven ounces in goods; this I found out by two hookes they had fastened to a great nicconee which had more weight upon it then there tooles had strength to remove, broake the hookes in itt, which I seeing made the goods be told, and found eleaven ounces wanting, the chief of which is narrow tapseiles. This lose (not knowing the transgressor) I consealed but keept strickt watch, expecting there second comeing, in which they failed me not, for nine dayes since Samuell Jones sees two men at the window, whome he watched till they had itt open, then ffetching a musquett, shott one of them through a loopehole in the fflancker with a brace of bullets, which went in att his side, and out att his backe; by this he was taken, and confessed his fellow, and this ffellow impeached six more of the towns people, upon which I sent for the Cabusheers and told them my losses, with the transgressors, and withall if they would not secure those persons that were impeached, they should pay for the goods, upon which they went presently and seized them, and finding one bendy four angles in goods in their houses, I can by no meanes perswade them to deliver the men into my possession, but they proffer to give the bendy four angles in goods again and sufficient pawns for four bendys twelve angles more, which I would not conclude upon, before I gave you advise thereof. Soe (Gentellmen) if you thincke fitt to lett the buisiness to be made up on them termes, or if you have any thing to say further in the matter, pray advise.

<p>If it be possible that the canooman Say hath spoken words to that high degree of mischiefe, I request so much Christian justice (if heathenism doth not predominate at Cabo Corso Castle above Christianity, for ought I can hear great creditt is given to the single report or whisper of a heathen rascall) I request the said Say may be punished according to his desarts and sent off or down here. The villany is to hard for me to bear, that such report shall be forged and I cannot come to give better satisfaction. How many times have I requested a vessel down here to come up and cannot be granted, and I will not be a boy to come up in a canoe. God bless all people from such hard fate.</p>

Perhaps they will sitt and chide the transgressors and he att the time shall stand and laugh in their face; but they will be sure to make a pallaver enough upon a white man if they can pick anything to build upon, for about 2 dayes before the date hereof a French ship of 12 guns and seaventy men came to an anchor at Taccarado, and yesterday the Commander and his Doctor came ashore here and while I was entertaining them Captain Assum came to the ffort, whome I sent for upstairs and set Charles Dean sentinell at the stares foot to keep the rest of the blacks down, it being their rude custome if strangers be here to run all upstares, which they would then have done, but being stopt four of them fell upon Charles Dean and beat him, which Samuell Jones seing took up a sword and struck one of them on the head with the flatt of it which drew blood of him (and that was as much as it did doe) and likewise drove the rest out of the fort, but the next day the Cabushers made a pallaver upon it and demanded twelve angles, which I was forced to give them, being unwilling to make resistance befor I gave your Worship account thereof, but if your Worship thinks fitt we might fetch it back againe, for they have as much reason to pay for stricking a white man as we for stricking a black, this being the third time they have struck a sentinell in the fort, and they are so impudent, that except we use force to keep them in aue, we shall be pulled out of the fort, and they laugh at us because we doe not, telling us our gunns stands for a show, we dare not use them.

I would have sent them in the last cano according as I writ in my letter, but they had so much lumber to carry with them that I was afraid of the canos oversetting and so to have lost the Company mony: but now your worship ordring the carpenter to be sent down, I thought good to send the four hand cano once againe which will carry them all, for it would have cost halfe the charge to send one alone. As for Captain Nanter I cannot learne where abouts he is at present but I am informd per the man that bought the rangoes that there is never a ship betwixt this place and Axim; but as soon as I shall understand where he is I shall give your worship advice thereof. About a week since there came Yankee from his croom with all his men in arms and other Antea Cabusheers with there men in arms all to Succondee town, bringing a great complaint to Captain Assum that the Cheife of Shumah<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-206"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-206""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-117"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-206"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>87</sup></a></span> had been up Shumah river<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-207"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-207""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-118"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-207"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>88</sup></a></span> into the Idooms cuntrey and had carryd two canoes loaded with powder and shott and arms for the Idooms to come down to destroy the Antea people, upon which they went up in a pallaver to the Dutch Cheife who gave them many fine words and perswaded them it was noe such thing, so after they had been with him they came to me to know if we would assist them and to desire me to write for more gunns, to which I gave them many faire promises, which very well sattisfied them, but in two dayes affter there came one Idoom man down and told them all the pallaver was falce, he said the Cheife of Shumah was there but he came to sell those goods, and that the Idooms had panyard them and would not pay him for them, upon which they were all sattisfied and went to their crooms. Now whether it might be policy of the Dutch to sent that man down I know not, nor yett can I give credditt to the blacks, but the occasion of my writeing is to know whether if at any time such a thing should suddenly happen your worship would have me side with the upland people, or watterside people, or whether to resist either of them, for although we live among the Antea people yett the upland people are our merrchants. I also desire your worships advice about letting the Antea people in our Castle, which I understand they all depend upon, if wars should happen, which I fear would be very ill convenient without it were two or three of the old Capusheers, for the Dutch will certainly side with Idooms and these being a sordid rugged people if we should lett them all into our forte and the Dutch resist them they would overpower us and fire at the Dutch from our forte, and although I cannot credditt any such thing, yet least it should unexpectedly happen I humbly desire your worships advice in itt.</p>

<p>Be pleased to understand that the people are making a pallavera to turn me out, because I will not trust them with the Companys goods, and so ruin and discredit my self. They have another article against me too for selling the iron barrs too dear, for where I give but 24 they can go to the Dutch ffactory and have 28 per bendy, and that I am too curious in blowing and picking their mony, and such like frivolous storyes. Tis only by the intercession of Old Pay and Captain Peter, two of the Chief Merchants, that I am not turned out before I could give you this accompt, for they are resolved to have another, which if you approve dispose with me otherwayes, as you are pleased to order, and I shall most readily obey.

<p>This accompanys my December accompt with his ballance, being 13 mk 6 oz 5a 4 ta. It would have been with you sooner, the difference betwixt Ahenisah and the Danes put by my intent, [he] is still soe much incenced against them that he is fully resolved to turne them out of their habitation shortly, the same to be delivered the English, the French to goe reside at Taisha. I have endeavored to hinder their settlement in these leward parts, Ahenisah will heare nothing of it but hath promised me faithfully he will not suffer them to buyld a Fort, only a house, for that reason has ordered them the abovesaid place, where there is noe stones to come at.</p>
<p>You are saying that you beleive Mr Fensman is tampering with the Dutch, whereby to inable him to satisfie us.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1695"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1695""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197262528-note-581"" id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1695"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>91</sup></a></span> I am well satisfied to the contrary, and can assure you none will have possession but us. When the thing comes to the point shall advise you. As to any pretence of injury done him I know of none, neither shall there any be offered by us, but what shall be acted to his displeasure is through his means, for the King says for [sic] the severall abuses the Danes have <span id=""page314"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197262528-milestone-1696"">pg 314</span></span>done his people, is the thing insenced [him] against them, and fully resolved to remove them from Christiansburg Fort where they now reside, the same to be delivered in the hands [of the English] as aforesaid, but in case of their refusall then to the French. At that time when I made the thing knowne to Ahenisah, that it was properly ours, the same instant the French were drawing up the Articles of Agreement, which was put by, with a promise that none should have it but us. The same woards Ahenisah sent downe by our guner, who is now returned from him.</p>
<p>In my last I forgott to acquaint you that the shipp Mary was liked to have been consumed by ffire in Accra Roade, it hapned in the manner ffollowing. Captain James, Comander of the said shipp, being ashoare with me, the Cheife Mate aboard tyes a cracker at a monkyes tale [= tail]. The said monkey being frighted with the same, runs up in the maine topp and [w]raps himselfe in the said saile, with the said cracker, setts the maine topsaile afire, burnt all the same part of the yard and said rigging. The sparkles of the ffire that came from the said topp burnt the arning [= awning] on the quarter deck. By Gods mercy it proved calme that day, having no sea brease, elce the said shipp had certainely been lost. News was brought the Captain ashoare, in another maner then it was acted aboard, informing him that the said monkey should take the match, as usually it is on the quarter deck, run up in the topp with the same, sett the saile afire as aforesaid. Doe beleeve Captain James knowes noe better to this day. I was informed of the truth how the thing was acted by the Cheife Mate on board, by the Master of Captain Wybournes vessell privately, who was on board the Mary then and gave his assistance in putting the said fire out.</p>
<p>I am sorry you have none of those goods I wrote for. Wee want the iron worke for the guns, not forgetting a couple of hatche[t]s, to curt wood, a few deale boards, to ffix a five hand canoe and seaven hand ditto, which, being in greate want, I have bought from Mumford. You wrote me about burning of lyme, it is impossible to doe it here, but if you want any oystershells you had best advise in due time, that I may gett them ready against oppertunity shall present. These sort of shells will doe you better service then those you fetch from Amersa. Just now arrived Captain Thompsons canoe from Arda with letters from [= for] you. She hath been 12 days from Whyddah, the people are tired. Tomorrow she shall proceed for your parts.
