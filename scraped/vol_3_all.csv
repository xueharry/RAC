<div class=""div2 prelim editorial""><a name=""actrade-9780197263921-div2-456""></a>
<p>Fort Royal was situated only 1 km east of Cape Coast Castle, within clear sight of the latter, as noted in one letter in this correspondence (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-508#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1404"">no.504</a>). It had originally been the headquarters of the Danish West India and Guinea Company, called Frederixborg, but was acquired by the RAC in 1685. In the correspondence of 1686-8 it was still called 'Fredericksburgh',<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1326"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1326""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-644"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1326"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>1</sup></a></span> the name 'Fort Royal' being adopted only from 1689 or 1690. It was also known as 'the Danes' Hill';<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1327"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1327""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-645"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1327"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>2</sup></a></span> or simply 'the Hill', as in some of the Rawlinson documents. Although Fort Royal was occupied continuously from the 1680s into the 1690s, correspondence from it in this period is recorded only from June 1691.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1328"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1328""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-646"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1328"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>3</sup></a></span> In early 1694, it had ten cannon, and was judged 'impregnable by its position', if adequately manned.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1329"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1329""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-647"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1329"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>4</sup></a></span> But later in the same year heavy rains caused its partial collapse (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-507#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1403"">503–4</a>), and its cannon were removed (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-510#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1406"">no.506</a>).

The structure itself fell into neglect; as Bosman later observed, 'it lay four years [i.e. 1695–9] more like a desolate country cottage, than a fortress; its shattered walls being mended with clay, and its house within covered with reeds, as those of the Negroes'. Bosman also noted that reconstruction of the fort was undertaken from 1699, but this was evidently after the end of the Rawlinson correspondence in February of that year.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1331"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1331""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-649"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1331"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Although Fort Royal did some trade, as recorded in these documents—mainly for gold, but also for corn (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-496#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1389"">no.492</a>) and on one occasion for a slave (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-480#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1362"">no.476</a>)—its principal importance was strategic rather than commercial, since <span id=""page242"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1332"">pg 242</span></span>it overlooked and thus potentially commanded Cape Coast Castle.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1333"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1333""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-650"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1333"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>7</sup></a></span> The correspondence from Fort Royal is less informative than that from other factories, being largely restricted to orders for goods and acknowledgement of their receipt. This doubtless reflects its proximity to Cape Coast Castle, which meant that more serious and urgent matters were dealt with in face-to-face meetings.</p></div>

I question not, if you can suply us with men and materialls, but before the rains to raise the fort of defence against any Negroes that shall asault us. If in very few days we have not workman the natives will be verry much disatisfied, and those that would be our friends may be forced to fayle us for fear of the Dutch. The timber for the lower floor I understand you have ready framed, and for the upper floor I beleive here is almost suficeint here, which if this [is] raised would stop the mouthes of the Blacks, we could better fortifie our selfes, and I hope tomorrow night or a Munday morning you will send men and materialls, that we may not slip any opportunity, for all the people are verry much disatisfied that I did not bring workmen with me. I have sent a broken maul and desire three maulls, two crewes [= crows], two pick axes, for the breaking of stone. Alsoe I have sent a man slave which has been blind a long time, and I humble desire more slaves, lusty men for the breaking of stone, <span id=""page148"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-916"">pg 148</span></span>and the free people will bring them [i.e. stones] to the fort, I supose for some small dashes, but as yet have made no [ms.

He says all the Blacks say it is he that has brought the Englisch hither, and it has cost him abundance of money and it will be a continuall charge to him till the fort is upp, the meantime he has noe place to fly to for protection, [and that the] Dutch are continualy offering him dashes and lickewisse the same to Great Taggee to turn us out. The Dutch I understand has a great trade and most of the people which live with them, could we protect them, would come and build under our fort. Here is not a lock to a dorre [= door] or any else, I desire if you have any to send two, if not I desire the armorer may macke them. John Cabess is verry desireous to have some blew perpetuanoes, and if you have any I desire you will send what you can, as alsoe some sheets (if you think convenient). John Cabess says he will live and dye with us, but he hath been in the Dutch fort since this falling out and I believe the Dutch will spare noe cost to gett him of their side, soe that we had best make use of the opportunity we have, for he tells me him selfe they have offerd him whatever he demands to turn us out. I find by him he is not disatisfied at nothing more than at our being so backward to bouild, that we may be able to protect him, which with my respects humbly thanking for placeing me here.</p></div></div>"

Affter my arrivall here, I went with Mr Howard and Serjeant Hust, and unsealed Mr Vincents chamber doore, and found in his roome most of the Royall Companys goods, and accordingly took an inventory of them, whilst the said Mr Howard and Serjeant was present, likewise the apparrell of the deceased Mr Vincent. Affter that a Dutch interloper came into our road. Our gunns being then unloadded, I went with said Mr Howard and Serjeant and unsealed the Royall Companys warehouse doore, for powder to load the gunns, which was the reason of opening the warehouse. Likewise at the same time took out one chint and two pounds of beads, the above being present. The next day affter the inventory was taken I added them to the invoice, and shall make my selfe debtor in my accompts. This really is the truth. As for Mr Vincents pawnes &amp;ca, [I] have [them] ready against the Gaily arrives, with the inventorys, but the Gaily is not yett arrived, she lyes as I am informed at Shuma, and has been there this 7 or 8 dayes. The difference betwixt Captain Nedd and Captain Billy is about building his house nearer this Castle, and to him I beleive I could make up this pallaver for a case or two of liquors, in the meane time I shall endeavour. I doubt not when your Worshipps receive Mr Vincents accompts to find your expectations answered as to the warehouse, which shall always be the endeavour of [myself].</p>
<p>PS. The information Mr Howard and the Serjeant gave your Worships was mearly out of mallis [= malice], because I threatned them about interlopeing goods which they had in the fort, likewise a slave which the Serjeant took upon him to buy and put in irons unknown to me in the fort.</p>

I hope the Quiferas will not come downe at all, for the Dankaras has sent to Taggee &amp;ca to send eighty bendyes and they will not lett the Quiferas come, so they will conclude to send them pawnes and when they have ajusted all palavera will pay them, this is what I hear, but they tell me that Ashrevy was at the Mine about six days since &amp; has taken mony to come &amp; turne us out, but he will not find it so easy as he may expect. Tomorrow we shall be of as good defence as we can be till we have raised the flanckers to their height with good morter, &amp; good &amp; dry lodging in the fort, &amp; then we must have the smallest guns you can gett, for these will take our work downe. The Dutch is on some new designe. The Galley is gone directly to the Mine this day. you may have an eye there to see if she doe not take Mina people to carry to Shuma to assist Ante Ashrevy.</p>

I am afraid the Dutch expect them much sooner, and beleive they will stick at nothing to gett us out. His messenger goes in the canoe. The great canoe is just arrived &amp; I have <span id=""page152"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-935"">pg 152</span></span>received the things sent by her. Here is hoocks &amp; hinges &amp;ca enough, but none fitt for the gate of a fort, but for slight dores, therfore I desire three larg[e] hinges, 3 ditto hoockes for wooden barrs. You advise you are in hopes the Quiferas will doe us no harme, but you may be assured that they will be with the Commenda people sudenly and that the King of Commenda is not able to resist them, as far as I can learne, so that if they come we must rely upon their mercyes, for we cannot pretend to defend our selves in the condition we are in. If I had the worckmen I would strike all these houses &amp; lay in the fort, &amp; run up a spur for the present with swish and stone, &amp; when we are secure strike it againe &amp; bring the guns in to the fort and plant them out at the lower window, so that with John Cabesses people &amp; our owne we may defend ourselves, if we should have occasion. I doubt not if I had all the workmen but in twenty dayes to have two flankers upp. I can if I have slaves gett wood, or I can hire free people to fetch it. The slaves I have will not keep these men I have at worck, soe pray let me have more men slaves. You give me noe orders what I shall doe about the free people bringing stone, therefore can make noe palavera with them. Here is noe timber fitt for joyce, and not joyce enough for the upper floor, so desire you will have joyce sawed for us. Basjohn says there is two peices of timber by the water side is fitt for nothing else, and if you will send sawers &amp; a saw I will saw what timbers here is, except three for the top, and will not be enough by at least thirty peices. I humbly desire that if any possibility of spareing the worckman that you will send them, &amp; I hope all will be to your content. If not I fear that when the enemy approaches that John Cabess will shift for him selfe, for he told me yesterday that if I was not here he would go to some other country, and asked me if the English had but one canoe. I satisfied him the other was at Winneybah. He replyed that he had allmost spent what he had about the palavera, and at last must be forced to seek for protection. I promised him as fare [= fair] as I can, &amp; tell him you will supply us with necessaryes as soon as possible. Here is but one crow, we should have four or six at least, and more mawls for the breaking stone. The canoe I returned as soon as she was unloaded, hoping to have her tomorrow with lyme, and when Capt. Piles comes I hope shall have his loading with shells &amp; some bricks if he can take them in. Crows and mawls are much wanted.</p>

People that were with me in my roome and warehouse were wounded, shotts comeing thro both. I was forced to come to a parley, most of my people being wounded and the rest out of heart.

Sirs, I allways advised you that he was an enimy to us and [there was] noe trusting of him. Take what the present offers, being in great danger att this time. I had the luck to have Mr Barter, who has behaved himself very valliantly, who after John Pinck was wounded was everywhere his presence was necessary. Our granadoe shells, which wee soe much wanted, were not worth that name, scarce three of them being filled. I have lost all my sheep, goats &amp; provisions, and I have nothing left wherewith to keep me &amp; my men, but must starve without your immediate supply. Lee, one of the Companys slaves, is panyard by them. I am in haste.</p></div></div>"

Paul Read still continues his sickness, or else I had sent him by the 13 hand canoa. You are also pleased to write me we have one woman slave more then you have an accompt of, which there is no more then ten women, nor never was here my time, as you will find by my inventory. Also acquainting that the 13 hand canoa went away without my knowledge, and that I thought she had more bricks in her then what was brought ashore the last night, but found to the contrary, and that I ordered them to carry the 7 canomen, they saying the canoa could not be mended, which since with some charge and a great deale of trouble have mended [and which] I sent by this.</p>

<p>Yours received with the cask of pease and 2 basketts of corne (which is a poor medicine for seamen &amp; slaves), it cannot serve above two days longer, wherefore you will doe well in sending more corn and bread for the white men, for here is not a bite of anything to be had but what comes from your worships. It can never be that two little basketts, and them not full, can be a chest of corn. Wee have that chest here, but should I measure it I am sure their would not be halfe a chest. Mr Salmons may be small, but never soe small. These canoe men have play'd the rogue with the slaves and townes people corn, they sold two basketts, one to the white men, the other in the towne. The towne canoe men says when they fetch corn from Annamaboe, they have 3 basketts and halfe in a chest. Mr Salmon would doe well to send word how many basketts. I am advised that the Companys slaves is sold at Suma with two more of this towne by an old man that was panyard with them, who was likewise carried with them, but as he reports the Copeman, being in hast to goe to Succondee about some bussiness, bid them bring him another time, so he made his escape, but I rather think it was he being an old man and unfitt for bussiness the Copeman would not buy him, and so might make his escape, as they have served severall here that have been panyard, the Copeman seemed to be angry and chid them, saying who gave you orders to panyar these poor people, saying goe goe father or mother, such sort of inveagling deceitfull ways they use, when [they are] so old and decriped [= decrepit], with shakeing heads, unfitt for any service in the world, not worth a canky. He further relates of a two hand canoe that was bound for Dickies Cove, the Copeman of Succondee sent a canoe of &amp; brought her in, which was fraigthted with two barrells of powder and twelve muskitts, they were carried to Suma, where your letter or letters were opened and read, and so for the Mine &amp;c. I am glad to hear that Great Taggee is so strong.</p>

<p>On Satturday night last I sent my boy Gamatan to Cabo Corso along with Mr Julois, but since have not heard of him. If you have sent him away from thence he is certainly panyard by the Mina people. Since Tuesday night our bomboy has been missing, I desire to know whether he be come to Cabo Corso. I had intended to have sent him downe as this night, for he was so horridly abusive to the slaves that they all came togither &amp; told me, exept I sent him away they would all go to Cabo Corso. He never would keep all to the Companys work, but would dayly have part of them to fetch his wood, to sell in the market for his owne use. I have at present put in one Coffee, a lusty young black fellow, one that speaks English verry well, and I beleive will behave himselfe civilly. Since my last I have paid all the slaves 1a each, but the bomboy none. Pray if my boy <span id=""page179"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1057"">pg 179</span></span>is not come away send up the slaves accompts, that they might be cleared to a day, for they are hard put to it to gett victualls, &amp; the white mens pay, they being very much necessitated to gett provitions, everytheing here being att an unreasonable rate.

The King have had dealing with the Dutch some time since I have been here, butt he tells me if the English have goods here as he want he will never have to doe with them againe, and if they bring an enemie to hurt us here they will take their Castle. But Sonday being wett and Monday was the day to begin to work, they told me they would not build a house nore doe any thing, till your Worshipps had sent the things I wrote for last, and that your Worshipps promised to send the King seaven bendyes more, and that they had no provitions to eat, and if they worked they would be paid, unto which I told them they had promised your Worshipps to build the house, and to help build the Castle, and in all their pallavers they had promised me the same, and thatt all their men should doe any thing I sett them about, but if they would not doe every thing they promised I had orders to take downe the flagg and begone, and that your Worshipps was not so ill beloved but had all the country thereabouts at your command, and would take some other way to have the fort againe. Then the Cabbosheers told the King he must make the house and they would doe all they promised, which accordingly they sent their men for wood and have been at work this two dayes, and will finish itt in two or three more. They desire the gunns &amp;ca wrote for, and the King desire your Worshipps to send him the seaven bendyes, and one bendy to buy the mens provitions while the fort is building. I have sent your Worshipps a ruff [= rough] draught of the old fort, and the dementions of the ground, and what addishions may be made if your Worshipps think well of itt, and that the hill may be fortified with a ranpier <span id=""page129"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-816"">pg 129</span></span>[= rampart] and parrapett erected with earth, and doubt not but it will be of great use, which beleive your Worshipps will like well if itt was done.

The earth will work the better to be digged now, and lye in the raine some time, and if your Worshipps please to have these things done, here will want some of the slaves that have made bricks, and some that can speak English, to tell the people what they must doe, and some of your bricklayers, six or eight iron shovels, six pickaxes, two or three dozen crews<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-817"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-817""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-443"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-817"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>105</sup></a></span> to carry earth, one grindstone.

I cannot conveniently draw out accompts for this place by reason know not the mens pay due to them (or each of them), but have supplyed them with money to serve their occations, tho have not called to a generall pay. I had last week some Cuffra men down, whos[e] business was to take fetiche with John Cabess that no traders or their goods should be panyard that came downe here (on mens heads that owed John Cabess money), which after had passed on both sides, the Cufferas promised to be downe in fifteen days. John Cabess hath sent a man with him into the Cuffera countrey to take a fetich for him, which pallaver I now perceive is the reason I have sold but five perpetuanoes and a chest and a halfe of sheets of the goods you sent me, but now in all probability I shall have a vast trade, not only thence but from the Addoomes. Yesterday our cook, one of the five old slaves you ordered me to pay corne to, is mising. He went for wood, as the other slaves tell me, whether he run away because he was not paid as the others are or [is] panyard, I cannot tell. <b>I</b> sent the Bomboy and old slaves after him, also John Cabess soldier, who brought me word they trackd his footsteps over the salt pond towards the Dutch Fort. I then sent the Bomboy to know if he was there, and also to demand of him a child, which Little Taggees men had stole, and was in his custody, or he could procure, as he sent me word by his boy with his cane, but when the Bomboy came to the Castle gate he was stop'd (the like he never did before) and the Copeman sent me word that he had or knew of [n]either of them, and sent me word <b>I</b> should take what followed if <b>I</b> sent anybody to his Fort againe. The reason I suppose [is] that three of his soldiers run away from his Fort, and perhaps mistrust me that I intice them, but I hear they are gone to the Mine for want of food there. Shall want boards to turn the arch of the tanck, and 1000 20d, 10d &amp; 6d nailes, some countrey match, wedges to break stone, and maules.</p>

<p>This is answer to yours of the 27<sup>th</sup> last month, when I received Mr Searle['s] old accompts &amp; your aprobation of John Story being Gunner. There is not a neater men in the Companys service for cleanseing of small arms, it being formerly his trade, but except he be allowed match mony he will not act, &amp; I am sure besides himself here is none capable. According to your order have sent an accompt of the expence of powder. It is verry hard upon me to give an accompts of every particulier cartridge of powder given out as such a time as when I first came, and the warr just ended, when I could not be att quiett for fresh comers for powder, as you will see per the bill. Had I denied all (though abundance went without) I am sure to have been reputed a verry ill man, &amp; I believe it would not [at] that juncture have been for the Companys interest or reputation to have been pinching of a barrell of powder. As to the expence of lyquors I am sure I come verry little short of what charge the Company are at out of my own pockett, and yet have not given half the satisfaction I expected. Yours of the 13 instant have received, &amp; can assure you there is nothing of truth in the palaver brought you about the serjeant and bomboy. T'is so far from any thing of that nature that my man has been this 3 dayes with Taggee &amp; John Cabess on purpose to gett them to send downe to the Captain of the towne (who is a great rogue) to lett our whitemen be supplyed with fish. This is the second time I have been forced to send to John Cabess, the first time one of Taggees near relations, &amp; did so because the Cabbosheers and fishermen that [w]as on assurance they would not play the rogue with the whitemen but lett them have what fish they wanted, he caused severall of them to lick the dust of the soles of his feet three times apeice with their tongues. I sent for the Captain of the towne as soon as received your letter &amp; asked him the reason why he sent such a lying story to Cabo Corso, his answer was because I had sent to Taggee. We are verry hard put to it for want of provitions, some time 3 days together &amp; no fish. I formerly writt for 3 or 4 dozen of hoopp for the powder barrells, which are now so decayed that we cannot touch them but they will fall in pieces. Pray send me some paper, for this is the verry last sheet. I have a great swellen [= swelling] fallen into both my leggs, that I am scarce able to stand, &amp; such a great paine all over my limbs that I have very much adoe to write.

This they told me thinking I would enquire no further into itt, and that I thought it was all truth they told me, and that accordingly it was plotted before what they should say, and their three canoamen that they said were lost were hidd, and could not be found for a great while, and that the first I whiped said the English did not use to whip canoamen for takeing care of their goods, and that it was done by thunder and they could not help it, but I saw to the contrary of that before I whiped any, by the canoa which was broken in comeing on shore, which in whiping the second and third men they all confessed the truth, and said they were goeing on shore at the Dutch landing place, which was not their business, for they might have been halfe way at Dickies Cove, or at least ways keep out to sea, then all the goods had been saved, but they had certainely a minde to play the rogue with the goods, as I believe they have with part of them, for one of the canoamen confessed soe, as I wrote you by the 21 instant.

If guns that lately came over are to large for this place you may charge two at Annamaboe, them being almost all small and wants larger, and then we shall have two on every flancker. These we have here already with after fireing will bring downe all our work. When another flancker is up we shall be as secure in our possession as we can be till there is a tanck. Water Capt. Piles says he has none for me. I designe to raise another flancker before I make dry lodgings for the men, which I fear must be made without thack [= thatch] to fence till after the rains. If those palavers was but over that we could safely suffer thack in the fort. The two canoes you sent hither to me a Friday I would have sent one to Dickies Cove to fetch the sawyers to saw the cokernutt trees, &amp; neither of them would goe, soe that I was forced to gett a canoe that was just going of to Cabo Corso to goe to Dickies Cove, and a Sunday morning they went a fishing, as they pretended to me, &amp; have never seen them since, so I supose they are returned to your parts &amp; I have not a canoe here. Capt. Piles if you order me in your next I will send downe for bricks &amp; lyme, &amp; I hope he may be here again before we are in any danger.</p>
<p>PS. The black soldiers are at me for mony, I know not what agreement you have made with them. I desire with the small guns shott, cartridge [ms. 'partridge'] baggs &amp; cartridges fitting for them.</p>

The RAC's factory here had been abandoned in 1688, when the town was attacked by forces from Elmina allied to the Dutch.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-841"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-841""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-456"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-841"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>1</sup></a></span> An attempt to reoccupy it in 1691 was withdrawn in the face of local hostility, as recounted in the first three letters of this correspondence. The factory was, however, successfully re-established from November 1694. There was already a Dutch fort in Komenda (Fort Vredensburg), which is frequently referred to in this correspondence. A quarrel between the Komenda people and the Dutch provided the opportunity for the English reestablishment there in 1694, which in turn provoked a protracted Dutch-Komenda war, which drew in several other African states as allies on either side.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-842"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-842""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-457"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-842"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>

In 1698, when Great Taggee was thought to be becoming too friendly with the Dutch, the English contrived his murder on a visit to Cape Coast Castle. Little Taggee then claimed the throne, now with the support <span id=""page136"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-846"">pg 136</span></span>of the English, but by the end of the Rawlinson correspondence in February 1699 the succession struggle was still unresolved.</p>
<p>Komenda had earlier been a major supplier of gold, but this trade was disrupted in the 1690s by the recurrent local wars. In the 1680s the main traders bringing gold from the interior to Komenda had been the Akani,<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-847"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-847""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-461"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-847"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>6</sup></a></span> but they are no longer mentioned there in the 1690s. In 1691 the principal merchants at Komenda were from Twifo ('Quiffera' etc.), to the north (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-266#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-848"">no.263</a>); but this trade was interrupted by the Dutch-Komenda war, in which the Twifo initially took the side of the Dutch, in whose interest they attacked Eguafo in 1695. Perhaps in consequence, in 1695 the Komenda authorities negotiated with Adom ('Adoome'), to the north-west, to open a trade (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-335#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1028"">no.332</a>); but Adom in turn then allied with the Dutch, to attack Eguafo in 1696. During the period of relative peace which followed, trading links with the interior were restored: by 1697, traders were again coming to Komenda from both Twifo and Adom (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-387#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1140"">no.384</a>), and gold was also coming from Denkyira ('Dankara', 'Dancra'), in the remoter interior (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-392#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1152"">no.389</a>). Slaves were evidently as yet only of secondary importance in trade at Komenda, although in 1695, following local fighting, significant numbers were offered for sale (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-336#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1030"">333–5</a>).</p></div>

Pray lett Capt. Piles take in what bricks he can to bring with the shells. If the canoe can bring any bricks with the boards pray let her, for they will be wanting. Wee want three walling hammers &amp; two trowells. The seaven which have been here since we first took possession want their pay. I know not what their pay is or from what tyme they must be paid, &amp; these which came last I know not what method to take to have them provided of, provision being verry scarce. These two days I have given them la a day to buy cankey, &amp; soe I must doe till I receive your further orders, &amp; that is verry short for working slaves in this place.

I have secured them all and examined very strictly, I have threatened them very severely, and I believe they have played the rogue with the goods they had in her, and I find them all in severall stories, and I hope shall make them confess somthing, for I find some likelyhood of it, but all as I can gett out of them they say they came ashore at the Dutch landing place, and before said to windward of our Castle, and that they believe the Dutch has the goods, whereupon I sent to see, but they own nothing of itt, but I hope to find it other ways, for two I have whip'd at the gunn but cannot make them confess anything to the purpose, but hope shall by inflicting punishment on the rest, which by the next shall acquaint you more at large.

Pray send at least 100 lb shott, for these lead barrs will the best [ms. 'beast'] part be given away to the blacks. At tymes I have desired bandilears, wee have but three collers in the fort.

Then I sent to tell him I was about my masters business, but by and by should be at leasure, and would meet him anywhere out of his Castle, so wee mett betweene the Castles. He asked me if your Worshipps had told the Generall of the Mina that you would settle againe at this place. I told him that was not my business to enquire affter. He said he thought the Dutch and English was friends. Yes, said I, and it may be best to keepe soe, and with a few words wee parted, but understand he is displeased and doe write to the Mine this night. About four this affternoone, the King came hither with a great guard. He came to me and then went to the Dutch Castle, but did not tarry above a quarter of an houre, then came to our side, where wee had a long palaver to that purpose, that he did promise your Worshipps that his people should help to build the Castle, which he will doe, and tarry here himselfe alwayes, if your Worshipps will please to goe about it presently, and send workmen and souldiers, and great gunns to defend the place, because he heard that some of the Anntar people did say, if any Englishman came to settle here, they would kill every man, but if your Worshipps will please to send men and gunns aforesaid, he would take care of all pallavers, that none should interupt the building, and say he love no roagues pallavers, if he did he would goe to the Dutch.

<p>Yours of the 6<sup>th</sup> instant by Cape Coast Tom I received, wherein I find it's myselfe must beare the blame, though others in the fault. It is true I have severall times writt you that I had all the assurance could well be required of these peoples fidelity to the English, they haveing taken feteeches thereon, and made all the protestations imaginable, sufficient to have deceived a more experienced person than I am, notwithstanding all which if they will play the rogue, can I help it? In my last I advised that 2 or 3 of the Cabo Corsoe soldiers had a quarrell with a man or two belonging to one of our Cabbosheers about panyareing a fowle, the former thereupon giveing one of the others a small cutt over the shoulder, which I knew nothing of till done, and that I see the people leaving the town, a very ill thing of them after their late pallaver, and positively contrary to one of the articles therein contained, not to make me acquainted therewith, but immediately thereon to leave their habitation. Nevertheless by sending some people to stopp &amp; lett them know I was not sensible thereof, but if they were abused would cause satisfaction to be given them, they stayed a while, when after two or three houres I sent for the Cabbosheer whose man was cutt in order thereto, which he by means of another person (whome I had allways been very kind to), who is the author of all this stirr, refused and withall sent some of his people away, a thing not sufferable in these parts, to have any person liveing under a Fort not to go thereto when required, without some great reason to the contrary, which observing and hearing his answer, I sent some slaves to stay them the second time, otherwise to bring him or some of them to the Castle, when againe I see others goeing in like manner, whereupon sent our black soldiers to keep them in, upon which one fellow lay in a bush shott Quomina and all fledd, some through guilt and others through fear. It is a thing common amongst these people to leave their dwellings in a time when they are not afraid of any enemy, haveing done soe both from Butteroe and Occaday since my being here. You see that wee have the wrong, which the bearer can satisfie you in, the pallaver not concerning me. Some of them will come of their own accord, and beg pardon. You tax me with breach of your orders, which I have always observed. I fear not Ashrevy &amp; all Anta together, the sea being att my command, wherefore since we are amongst an unfaithful I &amp; forsworne people, your orders are very strict for the preservation of the fort, whereby I am disabled to disarme or harme such as I find to be our enemies, but must harbor snakes in my own bosome, which, haveing an advantage when they please to give the first blow, may occasion the loss of all. I am oblidged to defend the Companys interest, when you are on our enemies side, soe that I fear to doe any thing therefore, and fear not to doe, for if any thing happens amiss, the same must be thrown on me, whereby I may be ruined, upon which consideration, and that you have them more capable to manage this place than myselfe, intending alsoe to goe for <span id=""page38"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-266"">pg 38</span></span>England in the next shipping, if you send a person in my roome shall freely resign what you were pleased to bestow upon me.</p>

<p>Yours of yesterdays date per the great canoe with what sent per her have received. We must stay for lyme, we always putt more swish than lyme, that you have now sent will only serve tomorrow. If we had lyme we should raise the fort verry fast. I sent downe one of the carpenters yesterday, &amp; he tells me he doe not see any timber fitting for the timbers of this flanckers when it is up. At Annamaboe there is severall peices fitt for nothing else, and will doe our bussiness very well. The Dutch last night came ashore with all their boaths [= boats], and by force landed their men just against the fort; they leaped out of their boates and gott up the rocks at least thirty whiteman &amp; three Blacks which swam before to show them the way, &amp; just now came ashore &amp; landed many casck of provisions at the same place, the Blacks continually fireing at them but had not the hart to advance to hinder it, the shott flying verry thick from the Castle and ships, and boats. One of our women slave goeing down to fetch the lyme as they began to fire came a shot from the ships, broacke her crew all to peices in her hand. Severall shott from the Castle &amp; ships has flew'd directly over our fort. Here is now a fresh talk of Quiferas coming this weak, but I hope they will be frustrated. Pray lett the canoes come both as soon as possible loaded with lyme, and Capt. Piles bring a good quantity, for the rains is at hand and here is not covering for the men. I have given John Cabess one barrell of powder you have now sent &amp; keep the other two, so that I have five barrells &amp; I cannot keep less. He is much disturbed to be so scarce of powder.

So I dranck to the man in a dram, as being a white man, &amp; soe was going from him. He still urged me that I would speake to the blacks to lett their slaves goe and come in quiet, I told him wee had no pallaver neither with whites or blacks, and I had nothing to say in it, neither would it be prudent in me to meddle or make up, the people being exasperated against them, that they were the Kings people, strangers to mee, whom I had never seen in my life before, and that he had better redress [= address] himself to John Cabess. Why, says the man, is he here? I told him yes.

The Copeman sent two canoes away to the Mine within halfe an hour, I suppose to tell the Generall his answer, and that John Cabess was here, but however <b>I</b> have seen no slaves fetch water. The Copeman when he sent the bold message little thought we were so strong, or that John Cabess was here. His embassador would have eat his words, saying the Copeman only bid him say so but did not intend to doe it. The meaning of my writing to [your] worships is to have your possitive orders, should they attempt any such thing, which I am pretty well assured they dare not.

The Arda slaves are verry much necessit[at]ed for provitions in so much that some of them are fallen sick and others verry weack, scarce able to do any worck. Here is not come or any sort of food to be had for money, so that if they are not supplyed from Cabo Corso with corn or yams they will be in a miserable condition verry shortly. This is but a sickly place at present, so hope you will not lett us want medicines and one skilfull to apply them, here being none that can lett blood if never upon so great occasion. Here is great need of water cask, there being but 6 in the fort, which would not containe water enough to serve us 5 days if besieged. If you please to furnish us with 18 or 20 hogsheads empty, we can gett them fill'd here, but the carpenter must order them better then the others he hath sent, else the water will all be spoyl'd with the beef pi[c]kle. I desire you to send me per next canoe a stone jarr to keep water in, if you do not use that on the battlements it will fitt my purpose. As for the European provisions I shall not be att all lavish of them, but the soldjers have nothing else to live upon, so that had need be well supplyed with all sorts. I desire to be enformed what powder, rum &amp; palme oyle is allowed monthly for the use of the fort. Att this time there is much powder used both by the whitemen and blacks in clearing their armes once or twice a weak, soe that I hope you will pleased during these troublesome tymes to allow something extrodinary on accompt of the powder.

I also to the utmost of my power have examined into the estate of the deceased Mr Thomas Pilkington, and dide find in his trunk (according to certificate of myselfe, ditto Pinck and Mr Charles Hamilton) mkl 2oz 3a 5ta, which again is therein deposited, with addition of 15a ta_ due to him from Thomas Alner, 15a lta from John Story, ozl 0a 6ta from Henry Casey, 4a from John Bird, 4a from Thomas Plummer, 7a paid by Doctor Hamilton, and 14a sent by myselfe for one pair of shoes, one silver spoon weighing oz3 and two small sheep vallued at 9a, which sums in totall doth amount unto mkl 6oz 15a_, being all I believe due to him in these parts, or that I can at present discover. Thomas Plummer and John Bird being extreamly ill and dubious of their recovery, I earnestly according to their desire entreate leave for sending them to Cabo Corso, and that I may bee supplyed with able men in their rooms, which wee shall much want, the remainder being sickly and capable of little service. I finde this place to bee ev[er]y day decaying for want of workmen and materialls to make a progresse therein. I shall doe my endeavour and hope your assistance will not bee wanting therein. As to the effects of Mr Thomas Edwards I must humbly referr you to my next, then hopeing to satisfie you in the particulars thereof. In the mean tyme must crave a supply of powder, haveing but one barrell, soe damnified it is good for little, also some Negroe irons, without which wee cannott secure any slaves in the Fort. You will receive by the returne of the canoe all the deceased concerns, with two men slaves bought by ditto for accompt of the Royall Company, who have this morneing broake a hoale [= hole] through the prison wall, had gone near to have made their escape, all which referr to your consideration.</p>

I used all possible arguments till my soule was weary. Att last I must lett them have one bendy or nothing to be done, which I did unwillingly doe and did not leave my selfe halfe an ounce. This day about twelve or fourteen more went, they say to call more from the croomes. I continually urge them to call their people in a body, for now was the time to gaine the favour of your Worshipps. They always promise well but doe nott performe accordingly.

Dick, to whome you have been toe [= too] civill, more then he ever deserved, is the chieff fomenter of all this buisness. I thought it my duty to advise you of these things since they soe near relate to my masters intrest. Gentlemen, he is a verry foothish [= foolish] fellow &amp; is let [= led] on by the nose by a parcell of rouges, who because they are indepted to Mr Goreing would be allways in pallavers, to keep them out of reach of paying of it. I suppose they being most of them for the Dutch, they [= the Dutch] may sett them to worke. I desire if you thinck it convenient now wee lie in soe ticklish a condition we may have Cabo Corsoe souldiers, that they may assist us in times when we shall have occasion. Wee cannot goe forward with the building because want a carpenter to fix the gurders [= girders] of our flankers, &amp; I doe not question but that we may goe on verry well. We have need, Gentlemen, of a Captain for this place that can keep it[s] people under, &amp; not such [ms.

I also sent to King Badue, but he would not come, but sent me word he and his people would come and build the towne and live here if the pallaver was ended. All they demand is three bendys eighteen angles for the soldiers in the countrey to make them lay downe their armes, and some liquor to drink, but without will not make any pallaver. I hear King Badue gave some pawnes to the countrey people to keep them quiett till the pallaver was over, and that they have brought him his pawnes againe, soe last Munday they panjard 4 of our townes women, and our townes people went out after them, but could not overtake them.

The occasion was through our souldiers panyaring of two fowles, which being refused by the owner, caused one of them to give him a cutt over the shoulder with his sword, which notwithstanding I sent word I knew nothing thereof, and would cause satisfaction to be given to the person, they were resolved thereupon to leave the place, getting together in armes, whereupon sending my people to stop them, and intreat them to stay untill they had a right understanding of the matter, they killed the party above mentioned, whose death his companions in the heat of blood revenged on one of them, which is all I know thereof. I am apt to beleive that, notwithstanding their feteeches and fair promises, they have been corrupted by Ashrevy while he was att Butteroe (whose Copemans boy was here just before the mischief happened), and wanted but a plausable pretence to play the rogue. I shall want two chests of sheets, which please to send me.</p>
<p>PS. Since writeing hereof I received yours of the 2<sup>d</sup> August with the things therein mentioned, save the paper. Jappo is liveing &amp; well att his croome, haveing killed a great many of Ashrevy's army, especially Dickies Cove men. I can have noe certainty of the news, for the Dutch spread abroad false storyes, and endeavour to conceal the truth as much as they can, only I understand he caught them sleeping before break of day, makeing three attempts on them, whom he drove severall times round the Dutch Fort, which fired att him.

<p>Yours of yesterdays date I have received with the men sent per the great canoe.

We stand still for want of lyme, &amp; then pray let the Galley come up with lyme &amp; bricks &amp; four small guns.

Both he and I hope they will not fall againe, and keep our slaves continually att work in getting shell between this and Butteroe, from whence think wee may procure 40 or 50 butts, which shall be sure [to] use to what advantage wee can. I am told their are great quantity of shells about 6 leagues to leward which may more then finish our work and that Mr Pinck hath payed for them, but unless I have a great canoe and halfe a dozen small ones for bringing them hither, shall reap little benefitt of them, the people here being unwilling to goe without extrodinary payment, and then but when they please, not halfe loading their canoes, but if you please to send me such from Cabo Corso or allow me to purchase the latter here for Companys accompt, I have canoe men belonging to me to padle them, who shall wholly imploy in fetching thereof, whereby doubt not in a little time and without much charge to procure lime enough for our building, if some new pallavar of the negroes does not interveen.

What the Cabbasheers are to have at Christmas and at their dancing time in June, be pleased to advise. The coppy of their contract being not with mee, have forgott. Here are abundance of Dankra traders continually baiteing me for goods, who would not lett me rest untill I promised to write for some, which if they come safe, could heartily wish were supplyed with, as well to defray factory charges as to satisfie the tradders, from whom have bought four cows, which if you please to have shall send downe by first opportunity.

Sekondi was destroyed, in 1692, in this fighting between internal factions, rather than by the Adoms (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-185#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-644"">183–4</a>). After a period of eclipse, Asirifi re-emerged, and it was he who destroyed the English fort at Sekondi in June 1694. As related in subsequent correspondence from Dixcove (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-51#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-259"">no.50</a>), the Adoms intervened, once again, in support of Asirifi's enemies in Sekondi. The RAC factors also allege that in this Asirifi was supported by the Dutch at Butri, an aspect which Bosman's account suppresses. The reoccupation of the English fort in 1698 was carried out with the support of Adom, but again opposed by the Ahanta (or a section of them), who were responsible for its destruction, in alliance with 'Little Taggee', an exiled prince of Eguafo to the east, and again allegedly operating at the instigation of the Dutch.</p></div>

<p>According to Mr Gores order I have note of what smiths work is wanting for the use of this Fort. He since told me you called it part knick knacks, I suppose you mean those things mentioned for which I sent a pattern. My reason was because I know the smiths are not acquainted with work belonging to building, nor are they capeable in directing me in my business. I am sure to my knowledge there has not been the worth of a two penny naile converted to any other use then the Royall Companyes interest. I am heartily sorry wee are obliged to trouble your worshipps soe often for bricks. I have been as frugall of them, and all other materialls, as any man could have been, but those we had proved so very bad that above four thousand of them are not worth anything, and I cannot pretend to erect any building firmly without materialls proper for what they are to doe, therefore humbly begg you will be pleased to send two thousand of the best burnt bricks, for wee received not above 700, which have but just finished the arch.

<p>Yours of yesterdays date with what sent by the 11 hand canoe I have received. I am sorry that both canoes are not fitting to come as I may have lyme and bri[c]ks. However, we goe on with another flanker in the mean tyme, and only the outside stones layed in morter, the other swish. I should be glad to have this flancker paved as we may mount the guns on it, which will be of great defence to us. The curtaine walls I raise all with stones because I would use as few bricks as possible, knowing the charge it is to sent them. The Black soldiers I will content as long as I can without any more mony, and when they ask me againe I will pay them according to your order. About two days since all the croomes about us were burnt, and we know not the meaning of it, but thought it to be the Dutch slaves, but this morning I understand that it was some out scouts from the Quiferas army. They will not macke any pretences on us till they have conquered Tagee, if they should it would too plainly show the Generall of the Minas false hart. I wish we may not be molested, if we are I doubt our case will be but bad, but I doe assure you I will not eassely loose possestion. A Cabusheer will be very convenient, if any body of men should apear, to send upon a palavera, for I must [ms. 'naust'] not pretend to face out with them but keepe faire as long as possible &amp; perswade them to our interest, if they are soe to be dealt with all, as to be sure if they conquer Taggee they will pretend the country to be theirs, &amp; soe may say that none shall settle but those that make agrement with them. I wish Taggee may have success, &amp; then need not make noe doubt of all this. I want trucks, &amp; axle trees for the guns &amp; twyne for lynes for the bricklayers &amp; gunners use, &amp; some thred to make cartridges. If you please to send another man in [the] Captains

We have had for these eight days last past such violent rains that one of the flanckers is downe, &amp; the rest I believe will falow [= follow] if the rains hold.

Also Paul Read lyes very sick, and is not expected to recover. By this have returned some broken iron work, not being fitt for use. Also this now received, being so slightly made, will doe us but little service, and are not fitting for that use wee apply them to here, but per the bearer above mentioned, have sent an accompt of iron work much more fiting for breaking of stones for our building and [would] break a great many more (in halfe the time) then such as have received hitherto, and doe a great deale more service, tho' what iron work have already received, if had been well made, would have done much more service then have, and broke stones enough to finish the flanker wee are now about, which for want of stones have been migtily our hinderance, tho' are mightily forward with it, with some part of each curtain walls adjoyning to it, and that if are not hindered as hitherto have been, shall have finished it I hope by Christmas. Therefore humbly desire what iron work have sent an accompt by bearer to be made to order to be made with all expedition, and sent as soone as possible with the bearer, [and] severall other things therein mentioned, advised of by the 4<sup>th</sup> instant, which is here very much wanted.</p>
<p>PS. According to your orders would have sent my accompts to the last October, but not being very well at the beginning of this month, and having had then taken but little money, and considering having great expences this month, and having had since much trouble otherwise in minding and forwarding the building, have not had time to write them out, which humbly desire would be pleased to excuse, which if had not done would not have been as forward as it is, which the same forwardness shall continue till finished, and that this month being near ended will send my accompts to the end of this month, which hope will be time enough and be as well.</p>

<p>The section of the coast east of the River Volta, comprising the Bight of Benin, was often called the 'Slave Coast', although this term was perhaps not yet established in English usage, since it does not occur in the Rawlinson correspondence.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3358"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3358""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1448"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3358"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>1</sup></a></span> The RAC's factory in this region was in the kingdom of Hueda, or 'Whydah' (also 'Widah' etc.), in the modern Republic of Bénin; it was situated at the coastal village of Glehue (modern Ouidah), rather than the royal capital Savi (referred to in these documents as 'the King's town'), 11 km inland.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3359"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3359""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1449"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3359"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>2</sup></a></span> In 1687 the RAC had contracted the Whydah factory out to a former interloper called Petley Wyborne, but after the latter died in 1690 it was again brought under the direct control of the Company.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3360"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3360""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1450"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3360"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>3</sup></a></span> As the name 'Slave Coast' implies, this region was solely important for trade in slaves; Whydah was indeed at this period the main centre of English slave-trading, accounting in the 1690s for over a third of all English purchases.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3361"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3361""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1451"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3361"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>4</sup></a></span> Although the Whydah factory was occupied continuously through the 1690s, relatively few letters from it were recorded at Cape Coast, only fourteen surviving in the Rawlinson corpus for 1691–9.

<p>The Dutch WIC had a factory at Offra. in the neighbouring kingdom of Allada ('Arda'), 30 km east of Whydah; when this was destroyed in a local war early in 1692, they initially attempted to relocate to Whydah, but withdrew soon afterwards (nos <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-1356#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3384"">1343</a>, <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-1358#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3403"">1345–6</a>). The French Guinea Company had a factory in Whydah itself, but this was also destroyed later in 1692, after which the French presence lapsed, leaving the English for a few years as the only European nation with a local establishment.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3366"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3366""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1455"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3366"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>8</sup></a></span> The Dutch WIC, however, established a factory at Whydah in 1698, as recorded in this correspondence (no. <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-1367#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3477"">1354</a>). French trade at Whydah had also resumed by 1698 (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-1367#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3477"">ibid.</a>), although a permanent factory was not re-established until a few years later.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3367"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3367""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1456"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3367"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>9</sup></a></span> Relations among Europeans in Whydah were complicated by the war in Europe between 1689–97, leading the English fort to fire on the French in 1692, which in turn provoked the seizure of the chief of the English factory by the French, and his deportation by the local authorities (nos <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-1356#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3384"">1343-4</a>). This clash also occasioned the fortification of the Whydah factory, which was henceforth regarded as a 'fort'.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3368"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3368""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1457"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3368"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>
<p>The operation of European trade was also affected by local African conflicts which are recorded in this correspondence. During 1690-1 trade had been disrupted by the rebellion of Offra, supported by Whydah, against its overlord Allada, leading to the closure of roads from the interior to the coast.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3369"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3369""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1458"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3369"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>11</sup></a></span> The situation was further complicated by the rise of the new state of Genyi (called 'Little Popo' by Europeans), on the coast 50 km west of Whydah, founded by refugees from the Akwamu conquest of Accra, on which the Rawlinson correspondence provides invaluable documentation.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3370"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3370""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1459"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3370"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>12</sup></a></span> It was forces from Popo, operating in alliance with Allada, which destroyed Offra at the beginning of 1692, and attacked Whydah later in the same year (nos <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-1356#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3384"">1343</a>, <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-1359#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3417"">1346</a>). The correspondence also records subsequent wars between Little Popo and the Adangme ('Allampo'), settled in the Anlo region, further west on the coast, in 1693–5 (nos <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-1362#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3439"">1349</a>, <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-1365#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3460"">1352</a>), and between Whydah and Great Popo, east of Little <span id=""page570"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3371"">pg 570</span></span>Popo, in 1694 (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-1362#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3439"">1349</a>). During this period, the disorders at Whydah, combined with the availability of captives from these wars further west, recurrently diverted European trade from Whydah to Little Popo, but Whydah remained the most important place of trade.</p>

Atta has been with the Queen of Anguinna, who is not yet return'd, and yesterday I sent Atta &amp; my boy to Quanzas to perswade him not to assist the Braffo, which he has promised them he will not. He had sent for the Anguinna bendifoes, who are now here, to have them assist him, but I have perswaded [them], as likwise the Winnebahs, &amp; also Acong (who will not suffer them to pass through his country) to returne. The iron work you sent with the whipsaw &amp; nails have received, butt the nails are much to bigg for our use. Have sent a naile by Atta to show what size we want both for the gate &amp; to floer [= floor] the rooms with. The sawyers are at work in cutting boards, &amp; hope shall quickly dispatch them, therfore desire may have a good supply of nails by first conveyance. I have finished another flanker (haveing no bricks) with stones, &amp; want tarras to finish the other two. I shall endeavor when the Queen arrive, to gett the ground rentt &amp;ca as cheap as I can, but I beleive she will not abate of what I writt, she &amp; the Cabbosheer[s] haveing learn'd too much what is yearly &amp; monthly allowd in Fanteen.</p>
<p>PS. Pray lett me have the chizell, &amp; two files to sharpen the whips sawes. Acong has sent to me to desire you will send him a dashee for refuseing to assist the Braffo, who offer'd him six bendys. I told him I t[h]ought you did him a kindness in advyseing him to the contrary, without any dashee, but he still makes his sutte [= suit]. I sent to Apom &amp; Acong &amp;ca but to no purpose, for I understand the interloper will have come tho' he gives 4a per chest. I have sent 3 women slaves per returne of the great canoe comeing from Accra in lieu of the 3 slaves return'd me. Pray let me have 2 or 3 barrells powder for the fort use, what I have being most expended. I have would have sent come now what I have, but neither canoe can take it in.</p>

<p>Tantumkweri ('Tantum Querry' etc., nowadays Tantum), is 27 km east of Egya (18 km east of Amisa); in the 1690s it was also known as 'Quansa's Croom [Kwansakrom]', after the name of the local ruler. An agent of the RAC did some trade at Tantumkweri in 1682, and left goods there, perhaps with the intention of establishing a factory, but these were evacuated shortly afterwards.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2536"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2536""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1076"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2536"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>1</sup></a></span> However, a claim to the place was maintained; in 1687, when it was reported that the French might try to settle at Tantumkweri, it was claimed that it 'belong[ed] to the Royal Company'.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2537"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2537""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1077"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2537"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>2</sup></a></span> A factory was established there in June 1693, during one of the gaps in the Rawlinson correspondence.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2538"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2538""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1078"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2538"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>3</sup></a></span> Five letters from the factory are recorded from August to October 1693, but it was then abandoned, evidently owing to the disappointing level of trade.

In July 1698, however, an agent of the RAC was posted to 'Quansa's Croom', initially apparently for purposes of intelligence rather than trade, and the factory was formally re-established in the following month; it was still occupied when the Rawlinson correspondence terminates in February 1699.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2540"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2540""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1080"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2540"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>5</sup></a></span> In 1693 trade at Tantumkweri seems to have been anticipated<span id=""page418"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2541"">pg 418</span></span>mainly in gold, though little was in fact obtained; but in 1698 it was initially envisaged rather as a source of corn.</p>

<p>Winneba ('Winnebah' etc.) is 20 km east of Tantumkweri, 62 km east of Cape Coast. The RAC had an establishment here in the 1670s, but this was abandoned in 1679; an attempt to reoccupy it in 1681 was abortive.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2589"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2589""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1101"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2589"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>1</sup></a></span> However, the English claim to the place was maintained: in 1682, when it was thought that the French might attempt to settle there, it was asserted that Winneba was a 'privileged place' for the RAC, and again in 1687 that it 'belong[ed] to the Royall Company'.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2590"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2590""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1102"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2590"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>2</sup></a></span> A factory was re-established in August 1693. References to trade at Winneba in the Rawlinson correspondence in the 1680s relate only to the purchase of slaves, but in the 1690s gold and corn as well as slaves were traded there. The principal hinterland suppliers of gold to Winneba were the Akyem ('Accim', 'Achim' etc.), on whom it was said the factory's trade 'depend[ed] wholly' (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-1137#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2824"">no. 1127</a>). From 1694, however, trade was also opened with the Akani ('Arcany') (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-1093#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2693"">nos 1083</a>, <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-1100#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2719"">1090</a>).</p>
<p>Winneba belonged to the kingdom of Agona ('Anguina' etc.). This was at this time ruled by a Queen, named Tituba ('Tettuba', 'Tutuba', etc.). She is said to have been the widow of the preceding king, and ruled as regent for her son, the heir apparent;<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2591"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2591""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1103"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2591"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>3</sup></a></span> by the 1690s, however, the son was evidently himself adult, and is mentioned as sharing authority with her. with the title 'Prince'.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2592"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2592""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1104"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2592"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>4</sup></a></span> The situation at Winneba was complicated by the competing claims of Agona's neighbours.

An even more powerful player was the kingdom of Akwamu ('Quamboe' etc.), to the northeast, which also controlled Accra. Akwamu had defeated Agona and captured its Queen in 1689;<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2595"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2595""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1106"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2595"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>6</sup></a></span> although she was evidently free again by 1693, Akwamu apparently continued to claim authority over Agona. At any rate, it asserted an interest in the Winneba settlement, and was involved in the negotiations with Agona, Akron and the English about it. Akwamu was generally understood to be opposed to the English establishment, presumably because it might divert trade from Accra. There were recurrent fears that it might send forces to destroy the English factory, but in the event no such attack took place. The Winneba correspondence also reports on events in neighbouring countries, including recurrent tensions between Akyem and Akwamu; the Komenda wars of 1695–6, in which forces from Akron took part (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-1116#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2779"">no.1106</a>); and the Akani-Denkyira war of 1698, in which forces from Agona participated (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-1175#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2912"">no.l165</a>).</p></div>

As for the powder you mention, 'tis nothing but what was allowed Dickies Cove when in no greater posture of defence than this place.

I desire John Ladd may not goe unpunished, for last Saturday he drew his sword on a fellow here, and uttred such words that is not fitting to be put in paper. I put him in prisone, where he shall containow, and he swears nothing shall serve him but my blood for revainge.</p>

Quansa by all appearance is concern'd with him. I have at last agreed with the Anguinna's people for six pease to let the Royall Companys slaves work in their woods, &amp; have set the sawyers &amp; carpenters to work, who have cutt downe severall trees, &amp; the slaves are now building a house to lodg[e] in.

As yett have had but little trade, being the blacks cheifely ask for perpetuanoes &amp; powder. If there be any herba longee gold I desire may have one case of them, two or three caske of two pound pewter basons, &amp; 5 lb if there be any, some brass basons, a case of good pintadoes, powder especially for the forts use, &amp; if can spare any to sell, &amp; tarras, tarr &amp;ca, nails.</p>

The two latter ask 4a per month each, &amp; I offer'd them 2a each, which I thought was verry sufficient, but Prince would not tell me how [much] he would have, but as far as I can gather he expect half as much as the Queen. I desire to know your pleasure per returne of this canoe, &amp; instructions what they must sign to. The Queen &amp; John Le Grand say they will take a fetish in the open market place that none shall be suffered to goe of to interlopers, &amp; if any should gett off will seize on their goods at their returne, and the other three promise the same when you agree with them.</p>

When I came downe from Commenda Mr Jackson gave me a book of letters to deliver to Mr Sheldon, telling me that he had left it behind him when he was last at Cabo Corso about his accompts. I gave him the book of letters, since which time he has been dayly drunk, and told not only all the Commanders of the shipps here that I stole this book of letters out of his roome and carryed it to Cabo Corso Castle to show it your Worshipps on purpose to doe him a diskindness, but hath also reported it to all the Blacks, makeing me as infamous as possible he can among them, and will not allow my servants to come to the fort with any message, but he is alwayes abuseing both me and them, soe that I cannot consult anything to secure the Companyes intrest here at this juncture of affairs, there being two potent armies not farr from us, and noe man knows what the conqueror may doe. The Braffoe stands on his defence, getting what men he can together in the feild, and if he bee doubtfull wee ought to be carefull, and not always drunk and abusive when wee should be upon business of such great consequence. In the next place he withholds slaves from coming to cutt wood according to your Worshipps orders for the burning of lime, they being here but one day, and then he sent but four. Thirdly, he had the impudence to break open the letter Mr Browne sent me,<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2495"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2495""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1055"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2495"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>65</sup></a></span> concerning the Serjeant at Annamaboe, and read it, and then brought it to me himselfe, with that bare excuse he did it before he was mindfull of what he was doeing.

There was with <span id=""page431"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2614"">pg 431</span></span>her three of the prime Cabbosheers, to whome I had no sooner made known the cause of my coming, puting them in mind of their promises both to yourselves by their mesingers as also to me in their many talks, telling them withall you had by reason they were soe pressing to you to settle here taken of the people from other places where the inhabitants would give money for your protection, but they would not give me leave to proceed in what I had to say, the Cabboshers rising from their seats said they were ashamed to hear any further, the Queen bad[e] me not molest my selfe, and that what she had promised should be performed, whereupon she sent one of the Cabbosheers which were with her to ask the Anguinas by whose instigation she had sent so many messengers to Cabo Corso to fetch the whit men, and if they were not ashamed to comence such a plaver now. They would have shuffled it off upon the Kinge of Acroome, but he denyed it as well as they, saying he never desired any thing but a cloth, to which the Queens messenger made answer it was not a time now to speake of that, but when the fort was up and gunns planted thereon, the which I ashured him he need not doubt of, so that one plaver vanished. The Kinge of Acrome rising up gave me his hand that he would speak no more of it, telling me that it was gone wi[th] the wind, to which I replyed that such gusts were able to blow down forts, whereupon all was turned into a laughter, &amp; he promised before all the Cabbosheers that his people should goe to work on Munday to dig the shells and gett them in a readyness, and that on Tuesday I should have them brought to the fort, beging withall a flask of rum to drink with them, the which I readyly consented to, but with this proviso, that they should have no more till such time they settled to worke, which was agreed on by all so that I hope all rubbs<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2615"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2615""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1120"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2615"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>20</sup></a></span> are over, and that our worke will goe on smoothly, for if we can but settle this I reckon the hardest of our worke is compleated. The shells lying at so vast a distance from us, being upwards of three miles, makes the people shun the worke as much as they can. The Queen spares no paines to forward the worke, and is therefore gone this day to the oyster bank, with a resolution as she tells me not to return till she hath accomodated all things, which so soon as is effected and that they bring us shells [I] shall send a canoe with advice. They say it will be on Tuesday, but I have been so often deluded with fair promises that I know not how to trust them. As for wood and stone it lyes nearer to us, so that we shall not want workin[g] on the latter, of which we have a considerable quantity ready at hand and they are bringing dayly, but in a short time we must be forced to goe to the rocks to breack them, for which worke we have not one capable, wherefore the surveyor desires you will let him have Hary the Bomboy, with 5 or 6 slaves which are at Dickes Cove, which said Harry knows are fitting for that work, that we may have some ready broken by such time these are worked up which we find up and down in heaps, so not to have any delay we are resolved to <span id=""page432"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2616"">pg 432</span></span>run up two flankers with all expedition to secure the footing we have, and the rather by reason the Queen informes me the Quamboes are gathering men together, she hath sent out her spyes to hear news.

<p>I have here sent you my February accompts, and have[ing] taken in but little corne, have omitted it in this accompt, and intend to charge it to this month of March. I am promised a great deale, but I find our great talkers is the least doers. Edward Barter is this Monday gone up to the Braffoe, intending to returne this night if possible. Our people here are very backward in opening the ground about the old fort, but noe men more forward to drink up the Companyes liquors. As for news here is none stiring worth takeing notice off, only talk of a great trade speedily, it being very little at present. The ballance of this accompt I have likewise sent, which is 15a 11t. I hope the next will prove better for the good of the Royall Company, whose interest here shall be carefully dealt with by [me].</p>
<p>PS. I want some thread to make the flagg. I cannot gett none here, therefore desire some.</p>

I had 11 perpetuanoes from Coffee, who makes demand of debts owing to him from persons liveing at Cabo Corso, and expects satisfaction before I part with the perpetuanoes, if not he expects the debts to be paid by me.

<p>'Allampo' (nowadays usually rendered 'Adangme') was the name of a people occupying the coastal area between Accra and the River Volta, 90 km to the east. In the seventeenth century, they formed a kingdom, with its capital at Ladoku.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3340"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3340""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1436"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3340"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>1</sup></a></span> Allampo is frequently mentioned in the Rawlinson correspondence as a site of trade. Kpone, 30 km east of Accra, where the Dutch established a factory in 1697, served as a base for trade with it (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-928#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2265"">no.922</a>). According to other contemporary evidence, however, the main place of trade in Allampo was a town called Le ('Lay' etc.), nowadays Leponguno, 25 km further east;<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3341"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3341""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1437"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3341"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>2</sup></a></span> this name does not occur in the Rawlinson corpus, but it is presumed that references to 'Allampo' as a coastal port relate to it.</p>
<p>There was no RAC factory in Allampo in this period. But the Company's agent Edward Barter traveled from Accra to spend several weeks there in August–September 1694, as reported in these two letters, and received proposals for the establishment of a factory, though these were evidently not proceeded with.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3342"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3342""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1438"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3342"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>3</sup></a></span> Allampo was mainly important as a source of slaves, but it was also noted for the raising of cattle, which were traded west to the Gold Coast.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3343"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3343""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1439"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3343"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>4</sup></a></span> Barter, in fact, went there specifically to purchase cattle. However, he also reported on its commercial potential more generally, including the possibility of trading for gold, as well as slaves.</p>
<p>Allampo in this period was dominated by Akwamu ('Quamboe'), which also controlled Accra; hence Barter in 1694 negotiated about the projected factory with Ado ('Addoe'), the co-ruler of Akwamu, as well as with the local authorities.</p></div>

I have alsoo received the articles of agreement of Dickies Cove and Commenda, &amp; when I have finished the same with the Queen &amp; Cabbosheers (which shall endeavour to do as much as in me lies to the Royall Company intrest) shall returne them to you. Since my last with my accompt to you, have disposed of all the carpets I had (saveing 3 or 4 damaged ones), therfore request you will send as soon as possible 300 carpets, here being traders that stay purposely for them, &amp; one cask knives, bras pans &amp;ca. Powder &amp; blue perpetuanoes are verry much wanted, which later at present must be contented withowt. I have per returne of the canoe sent 325 sheets (being as much as the canoemen say they can carry), tho' believe shall soon be in want of them, being in expectation of a verry good trade. The axle trees shall be sent up as soon as can be gott ready. If you please to send a cask shall send up lime, haveing a considerable quantity already burnt.</p>

There is not a ship any where nigh them but that they send off, which I do what in me lies to hinder, but till we have force can do nothing. The Queen promises that when my goods come none shall go off. I am unwilling as yett to have any difference with them, not knowing upon what grounds we stand. If you are designed to withdraw us pray lett me have secrett notice, for I fear they will be unwilling to lett us go and may play the rogue, so that I would send the best of my things away before the Briganteen comes, if that goes forward and [you] can spare the Briganteen to let her lye here 3 or 4 weeks time, it would be for the safegard of the goods you send by her, for by that time I shall find whether their promises be reall or feigned, and whether the money they brag of will come down. I have no rum left to give them that carry stones, therefore if you go forward must send some speedily, for drames must be given to encourage the workmen. They worke with great eagerness since Quo come down, so that if you can make up the breach between Quamboe and Anguina you will have nothing to fear. The Queen presses me to send for more bricklayers, which if they continue as they begin we could employ. I have by the surveyors advise entertained those two Black bricklayers, but cannot gett them under what formerly advised, if that go forward and [you] can spare any workmen for a month or six weeks it may forward the building, for I am afraid in a short time they will have expended that provision they brough[t] with them and then will be returning to fetch more, they say they have enough for 2 or 3 months. A carpenter or two would be very necessary, but the young fellow I sent up knowes no more how to handle an ax then I do. Here is good woods about five miles off where they say there is very large trees, which so soon as have any time intend to go survey, but we must be forced to cutt them to their sizes and square [them] there, for the better bringing them down. In the mean time we shall want them which I wrote for, for the more expeditious covering our first flanker, for the rest shall do my endeavors to provide them here. The Queen was intended to have sent up a Cabbosheer, but afterwards desired to lett Jack go, because he had heard all palavers, and deferrs her going up into the country till such time he comes down againe. This news of Quamboe makes her very vigorous to forward the building. They sent to me just now to intreat you to lett her have more bricklayers, she will see they shall not <span id=""page438"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2640"">pg 438</span></span>want stones nor shells. I wish yould spare us 10 more slaves for fetching water, for the country people will go but once a day. We shall want those slaves from Dickies Cove, for if we go on as we have done shall quickly gett all the stones that are broaken to our worke, so that the Anguinas will have a pretence to be gone. They worke both night and day, when one Cabbosheers men leave off anothers begin. As for the bell I can hear nothing of it. Capt. Jefferyes saith he never sent any canoe thether, and neither he nor Quo knows anythinge of it so, that Mr Bloom must send some better directions.</p>
<p>PS. Jack is sent up by our Queen and is able to give you a perfect accompt of all transactions here, as also whether the King of Quamboes man gives the same palaver to you as he did here.</p>
<p>[PPS] We want 100 the larges[t] spikes that are in the store.</p>

The garders are up and the joyces are layde, soe according to your order I have returned Bastion and all the slaves except 3 which wee cannot be without them, and as soon as possible shall return them all. The old boards about the Forte will not cover our woork, soe humble desire the boards a Munday morning, that the Forte may be repaired at once as it should be, and then it will not want [for] maney years. If not, to put such rotten boards as wee shall be forced to doe will spend the lime and tarries to noe purpose. The roome over the cookroome must likewise be taken up to put in two large joyces which are heare for that purpose, wee hardly dare walk on it. Besides a great maney other places will want boards, to teadious to trouble you, which if I have necessaries the Forte shall be repaired as it ought to be, but if they are not to be had I hope I shall not be blamed heareafter. The carpenter and bricklayers doe not set any time. I told them that you wrote and asked them in what time they judged it would be done, all they told me it would be at the end of the next month, but I will forward them as much as possible. If you cannot possible spare soe maney boards pray send what you can, wee must make the best shift wee can to cover the cookroome.</p>

One is a 13 hand canoe, the other two 11 hand &amp; a 7 hand canoes, the men in all thirty two [ms. 'tow'], six whereof are wounded. They are loaden with empty sheet chests, but cannot as yet tell how many. The canoes as yett lie att a grapling. The men I have in the fort, but am att a great loss to secure them, haveing not one paire of irons to putt them in, soe request you will send twenty or thirty paire as soon as you receive this, else it will be very dangerous either to lett them lye here or send them up, which if you soe doe pray lett the canoe men you send be very well armed. The people that panyard the canoes doe expect some considerable reward, also Acuma, who went in person, one of the Cabbosheers, to gett the Cabbosheers of Barracu assistance their, who sent off their canoes on their approach to assist them, who I presume expect likewise some gratuity. The bussiness is very expensive to me in liquor, which hope may be allowed to be charged, as likewise other expenses. Mr Searles canoe putting in here on her way up, have delivered [to] the canoemen to take this with them, and also have sent the December and January accompts, duplicates whereof will send by next opportunity. I have not taken enough this two las[t] months to defray fort charges, as per accompt appeares, for want of vendable goods, which now, the Fauconberg being arrived, hope may be supplyed with goods following per first opportunity, blue perpetuanoes, sheets, Welch plaines, powder, knives 1 lb basons, herba longees, fine sletias, &amp; ca, a good quantity of each.</p>

In the 1690s this village was also known as 'Quashe's Croom [Kwasikrom]', after the name of its ruler.

<div class=""div2 prelim editorial""><a name=""actrade-9780197263921-div2-599""></a>
<p>Anomabu ('Annimaboe' etc.), 5 km east of Anashan, was the site of one of the principal establishments of the RAC, occupied continuously since the 1670s. The factory was fortified, and known in this period as Charles Fort; it was described in 1694 as 'pretty strong, of about eighteen guns.'<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1577"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1577""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-716"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1577"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>1</sup></a></span> The Dutch West India Company also had a fort (Fort Amsterdam) in this area, at Kormantin ('Cormanteen' etc.; nowadays Kormantse), 5 km east of Anomabu, which is referred to in this correspondence. Anomabu was principally important for the supply of corn, for the provisioning of slave ships: in 1689 it was described as 'the principal granary', from which all English slavers drew their corn.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1578"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1578""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-717"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1578"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>2</sup></a></span> It was also a significant source of gold, although it had a reputation for supplying adulterated gold.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1579"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1579""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-718"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1579"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>3</sup></a></span> Moreover, the supply of gold in this period was subject to recurrent disruption. As in the 1680s, the principal traders from the interior who brought gold to Anomabu were still the Akani ('Arcany'), but Akani access to the coast was threatened in the 1690s by disputes with the state of 'Cabess Terra' (i.e. Etsi), in the immediate hinterland of Fante (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-636#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1640"">630</a>, <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-716#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1797"">710</a>). Perhaps in consequence of this poor condition of the gold trade, there are more frequent allusions than in the 1680s to the purchase of slaves through Anomabu.</p>
<p>Bosman referred to the problematic relations of Charles Fort with the local community, its occupants being 'sometimes even confined to their Fort, not being permitted to stir out', and unpopular Governors suffering deportation, 'nor are the English able to oppose or prevent it, but are obliged to make their peace by a present'.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1580"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1580""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-719"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1580"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>4</sup></a></span> The Rawlinson correspondence confirms this picture. During the 1680s, two successive chiefs of the fort had been forced to be removed, in 1686 <span id=""page278"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1581"">pg 278</span></span>and 1687.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1582"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1582""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-720"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1582"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>5</sup></a></span> As related in this correspondence, a third, John Gregory, was likewise recalled by the Company, in May 1692, after a dispute in which he had first taken hostage several leading local traders, and then fired upon the town, killing and wounding several persons (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-652#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1667"">646–8</a>).</p>
<p>Like Anashan (and Kormantin), Anomabu belonged to the state of Fante ('Fanteen'): hence 'groundrent' and 'customs' for the fort were paid to the central authorities of Fante, the 'Braffo and Corrantiers' (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-618#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1614"">612</a> etc.), and complaints about conditions in Anomabu were addressed to them (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-600#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1583"">594</a> etc.).

The correspondence also documents political divisions within Fante, between the Brafo and other chiefs, which arose in part from differences over these issues of foreign policy, and which led to the deposition of one Brafo in 1697 (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-877#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2130"">871</a> etc.), and to fighting in which another was wounded in 1699 (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-935#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2283"">929</a>, <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-937#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2288"">931</a>).</p></div>

<p>Yours of the 19<sup>th</sup> instant I have received, and according to your orders therein, shall use my utmost endeavours to keep the Dutch from ever settling in these parts. Since my last, I sent Atta to Anguinna, who brought downe all the Cabbasheers with him. whom I examined about the pall[a]ver the Dutch hath been tampering with. They own'd the Copeman of Accra had sent to them concerning the Mine canoe men and also setling of a factory, but said withall they returned him answer that the Dutch were strangers to them, and that the English were settled already, and would suffer no other to settle in this countrey. They likewise confessed they was to blame in not acquainting me of it themselves, and promised for the future if the Dutch send any more errands to them, they will immediately acquaint me of it. With much adoe I made up the breach between Attabo and them, who are all returned friends. They would not be satisfied till I gave them a blue plaine, and ten gallons of mmm I expended amongst them. I have assured them that if they prove true to the English they should not on any occasion want what assistance you can give them, with which they were satisfied. Wee are in great want of bricks and tarris, which request you will send per first opportunity.</p>
<p>PS. This day a Portuguese by name Francis Gonsolous. haveing deserted a Portuguze ship, came hither and desired to be entred for a solder to serve the Royall Company as a souldier for three years, and desires to remaine here in this place, whom I have entertained att 8a 4ta per month, presuming you would not disaprove of itt. here being so few men.</p>
<p>I have sent up by this conveyance eight wood axes to be mended, and desire if you have any new and larger you will send some, these being to small.
There is now a ship to windward towards Apom which I believe is the Fauconberg. If it be I am disappointed both in sending the slaves, timber and canoe.</p>

It had again been re-established, however, by the beginning of 1699. The Anashan factory was not fortified, being described in 1694 only as 'a thatch'd house'.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1415"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1415""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-666"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1415"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>
<p>In this period, Anashan was mainly important as a supplier of corn, to provision slave ships: only small amounts of gold seem to have been obtained, and small numbers of slaves. The hinterland traders supplying gold to Anashan in the 1680s had been the Akani ('Arcany'), and they are still mentioned in this role in 1695 (no. <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-587#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1556"">582</a>). Anashan lay within the country of Fante ('Fanteen'); hence the factory paid 'custom' to the 'Braffo'. the head of the Fante state, as well as to local 'Cabosheers' (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-531#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1456"">526</a> etc.).<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1416"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1416""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-667"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1416"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>4</sup></a></span> The correspondence from Anashan makes some reference to Fante foreign relations, notably a war against 'Cabess Terra' (Etsi), to the north, in 1693–4 (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-554#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1499"">nos 549</a> etc.), and the sending of forces to intervene in the Komenda war of 1695 (no. <a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-590#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-1561"">585</a>).

<p>Yours of the 23 instant I received, and according to your order have agreed with the Anguinna Cabbosheers to pay one bendy per month ground rent from the time the Queene first signed the articles. I have paid them four bendys eight angles in hand for the time past to the time of their signing and takeing fetiches to the articles, vizt 25 instant, which they would not be content without a[t] first demanding from the time I first came here, which was long ere I could beat them of from. For the future they will have it [ms. 'to'] paid to the Queene, who is to give them one halfe. They would not take the fetiches without I gave them an ounce and four gallons rumm, being they said their lives depended on it if they broak the fetich, which they published by their Chitchee in the market place that they will punish all offenders. They likewise would not take the fetishee without I paid them 12 angles more for the sawyers workeing in their woods, six peize they said was not enough for all Anguinna, soe was forced to comply with [ms.

<p>The Cabbosheers both of Anguinna and this place all assure me there is a faire correspondance between them and Aquamboe, and the messengers from Aquamboe have told me the same, who are now along with Quansa att Tamtumquerry, soe shall have noe more allarums from thence. The Accroomes are the only people now that are likely to breed disturbance. The fetiches have been newly taken that they should not trouble this place. Two of the slaves I bought being makeing of swish, through the bomboys carelessness, who whent away and left them to themselves, they broak of their irons and run away, whom since have heard are in the Accrom country, who [= the Accroms] will in noe wise lett me have them, tho' have offerd 10a for each.

By the ship will likewise return the 5 hand canoe.</p>
<p>Att Ata's arrivall I sent for Attabo to mak the pallaver here, who immediately came downe, to whom I laid the palaver Mr Searle acquainted me with, in presence of Capt.

He hath againe taken a fetish to be true to the English Company, and also Prince, who says that the same was utterly unknown to him.

This I thought needfull to acquaint you with, tho the canoemen are safe aboard. I have not any lime to spare, haveing none but the Mine canoemen to fetch shells these five weeks, and what they have fetched are all used, except enough for one small kiln unburnt, and cannot expect any quantity till the raines have broke open the salt pond.

For bricklayers, considering your necessities, shall not press, only desire that when the dry times come in you would lett one that is a workeman come downe for 10 dayes to looke upon the flankers, which I formerly advised you was afraid had received damage. As for Johnson whome I sent up, being lame, he may doe very well where there is other workemen, but wants as much directions as any blackman here, wherefore cannot rely on his judgement, and if I had my desire should rather have his roome than his company, he being such a quarrelsome fellow [to] both whites &amp; blacks. By this conveyance you will receive my accompts, which I have moderated as much as in me lyes, but doubt not in two months or three to bring them lower, for which reason I have discharged one of the free bricklayers, being but one indifferent workeman and very lazy. I assure you it would be much to my satisfaction could I find out any way to lessen the Company charge, knowing very well it would redound to my creditt, which in this world is the cheif staff I rely on, but the many countrys I have to please and withall the ill principalls [= principles] of the inhabitants considered, may I hope be a sufficient reason of my non abillity. It hath and doth give me noe small trouble to keep a union amongst them, for should they fall out and the Acroms joyne with the Aquomboers, which said [i.e. Aquomboe] King hath tryed all ways to effect, the Aquomboers would attempt to beate us from hence. The Anguina &amp; Wynnebah Cabbosheers are prepareing to go up to Acrom to take their fetich to be true to them and assist one another against all enimies. The Acromes have been here and taken theirs. They are desirous I should goe along with them, but I have putt it off and shall only send Captain Quo and one anchor of rumm. Soe soon as I can gett the carpenters worke finished shall runne up the front and two flankers and cover them with all expedition, which being effected shall not fear any of their palavers, it affording sufficient lodging for all our white men,

I will get what I possible can, and when the ship taketh the slaves shall put every chest I have aboard, but I beleive that will be very little, for I am dayly in hopes of more slaves.

When he came he begged pardon, and said it was only words between boyes. However the Coapman confined him to the Castle, till I should be gone home, at which a mollotta named Brinee armed himselfe and tenn of his slaves, with one Amba, resolving to waylay me goeing home, and murder me, butt Briny by perswations and force of a Cabbosheer went home with his slaves. Nevertheless Amba still resolved on his bloody designe, which [I] knew nothing on till I was got about halfe way home, where in a cross path, the grass as high almost as himselfe, I met the villaine, which plainly appears had he not been frusterated of his consort, they would have endeavoured to have effected their designe, and nevertheless would this Amba [have done so], had not I had four armes with me, for there he stood with his peice ready, cartooch box by his side and a shot in his mouth.

Besides the slaves were sent here before Mr Searle left the place, which cann prove by Mr Coopers notes to him, and he did not deliver command of the factory to me till he tooke his leave at the gates, so that damage lies rather more on him then me. I give you a more particular accompt because Mr Searle told our Doctor that since they were left in my custody, [I] was oblig'd to macke them good, but that in my judgment is an error. Had they all died I presume it is on the Companys accompt &amp; not mine. In the roome of the slaves you return'd belonging to me have sent another woman that I bought of Mr Gudge, because I would not be at the trouble of altring my accompts, haveing already entred them in my books. I hope Mr Cooper will do the like without any further trouble, haveing also given him credit in my accompts for five women. I received by the canoe one hundred perpetuanoes. Just as the canoe came to shoare the seas run so high that fill'd her with water and the perpetuanoes were verry wett. I have opened &amp; dried them all, so hope they'l sell for not less.

Captain Hansicoe &amp; Amoe, who departed from hence this morning, can informe you of the whole, to whome referr. Though they were detarded some tyme it was not wholy mispent, for I sent for the chiefe Cabbosheer of Accroom, one who hath more power then the King, and made up all palavers with him, who hath promised to bee down on Munday with his people to bring shells. I shall not trouble you with any further advices, expecting the Briggantyne down dayly with those necessaries formerly wrote for, which are what wee have occasion for. I hope our building will now goe on to your content, which shall bee my utmost care to forward.

<p>Our Cabbosheers have been very importunate with me concerning their customes, they refuseing to take whatt Mr Brownes advice to me specifies, which is three boysadoes instead of five ginghams, and two Welch plaines. They tell me they are noe women to wear boysadoes, I tell them againe that though they doe nott wear itt yett they doe sell itt, being a vendable commodity of this country, and likewise the trade of either money or corne is nott soe great or soe much furthered by any of them, thatt they should be soe scrupleous of takeing their customes. All that I can say of them is this, if any money be stiring tis carryed aboard shipp, and if have any soe badd thatt the shipps will nott take itt, tis brought to the factory, and as for corne they bring just as much as they cannot help bringing when there is noe ship here, and thatt they want goods as may bee seen by my accompt. Besides an affront I lately received by one belonging to Aqua, which I will not now trouble your Worshipps with untill I see thatt justice shall be done me here.

<p>Yours of the 17<sup>th</sup> ultimo by the Briganteen have received, with the goods &amp; necessaryes therein mentioned, and ane addition of three guns, in such a condition [they] are almost unserviceable, [they] want both smiths &amp; carpenters work, which I am ill provided to supply them, besides there is neither shott, powder nor any thing belonging to a gun, which makes me presume the press of business diverted them out of your memory, not having any advice of them in your letter. I was in expectation by said conveyance to have received some deal boards for scaffolding, haveing informed you soe largely of my wants, but I find you are not pleased to give any encouragement to the worke, otherwise you would not have suffered me to be here soe long without a board. Pardon me that I am thus plaine in expressing myself, but it is come now to that push that I cannot avoyd it, being forced to lett the worke stand still, and only provide [blank] shells and stone against such time you can supply me. On Saturday last I had like to have spoiled two of the Companys slaves through the weakness of our scaffolds, being for the most part say case boards, with old rotten canoes, with which I have run the worke to that height, being now in the lowest place up to the first story, and all the back near six foot higher. So soon as deals come that I can cover any flankers, I shall have sufficient lodging for my white men in them, and doe intend to reserve one for my goods, being timorous of having soe great concernes under a thatch cover, for which work must desire you to supply me with some bricks. The bomboy was much to blame to reckon 5000 more than he sent, which the surveyor &amp; all the workemen can testifie to be true, with which now I could [have] made shift for the present. If you could spare the surveyor and with him what carpenters you have to come downe &amp; lay the beams and fix the joices, you might have them returned in a small time, and then we might carry up our worke regular, and besides would forward us very much, for in a small time wee shall worke as farr as we can goe till this be done, soe that the bricklayers must stand still and look on the carpenters. Be pleased to consider, at whatsoever time it is done, must have a carpenter or two from you, <span id=""page450"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2694"">pg 450</span></span>and hope it may suite with your conveniences to spare them now. Will is a very willing fellow, and when is well doth not grumble at his worke, but he must have somebody to direct him. He is now laid up with wormes, as also five or six slaves more. By the great canoe wherein went Capt. Jeffreyes went up Grande Quacou, he haveing been sick ever since I brought him downe. I had told Abraham he should goe up by the first opportunity, which made him put him in without further acquainting me, by which means I did not advise you sooner, which I hope you will excuse. If he is not in a condition to come downe I desire might have Tom in his roome, who I left behind, [he] being gone with Captain Hansicoe. His woman is here, who importunes me every day to write to you for him. I have had all the Anguina Cabbosheers downe here for these twenty days, which hath putt me to a great expence of liquor, all my rumme being expended, and what is more could not content them, their demands being soe unreasonable. They brought downe with them three quarteirs of young men of between 30 or 40 each.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2695"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2695""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1165"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2695"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>65</sup></a></span> which worked very well for 10 dayes, but when I came to press the Cabbosheers to hasten downe the next quarteires they told me they must see what I would doe, and before any of them should come downe they expected every one a cloth, which were upwards of twenty, telling me what I had already given was too little for all Anguina. I find if we have any assistance from them it will cost more than it is worth, neither can I give any thing with safety, having had large promises when I gave the last money that noe more should be demanded, now they pretend that was only to one division, which is 3 quarteirs. When they found I would not comply with them they endeavoured what they could to persuade the Queen to goe up, but instead of prevailing with her she rise up in a passion, and told them if they had noe shame she had, and since she had sent &amp; fetcht downe white men [she] would not leave the place till she had performed what promised, and sworne by her fathers head [she] would eate new corne &amp; yamms here, and to show it was her intention hired the Winnebah to roasar for her, which they have done considerably, and with that left them, who imediately departed to their habitations in the country. What the event of this will be I know not. I have been with her since to know what we shall doe, she bids me let it alone to her and I shall see she will bring them downe, and in the mean time hath sent her own slaves to come with all expedition, with whom, the Barricus &amp; Mamfords [= Mumfords] I shall make shift, having some stone left, but must desire you to send me 2 or 3 quarter casks of rumme, as also some brandy for the Queen, who drinks noe rumme.

By these their unjust dealing you may perceive what troble I have with them, they not being like the rest of the Negroes, who after they have once made up a palaver stands to what they have done.

About three weeks agoe I had a hole cutt in my thacht of my house, &amp; lost six halfe firkins of tallow, apon which I called the Winnebah Cabbosheers and Queen, demanding satisfaction. The Queen proposed to send up to Anguina for a fetche to be taken by foure boys, one for Anguina, one for Acroomes, one for Winnebah, and one for Fanteene,<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2739"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2739""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1188"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2739"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>88</sup></a></span> on which it fell the countrye to make satisfaction both for these tallow as allsoe some goates and sheep I had lost.

The Winnebah, Accroomes [and] Quansoe being likewise come, whent to her and told her it lay now apon her to look owt the theives and make the white men satisfaction. Her answer was she had sent to Anguina about it, and if she could not heare of them she would goe up and let the white men returne to Cabo Corso Castle, [by] which answer you may perceive I am not likely to have satisfaction withowt the theives are found out or force be used, which latter course as it can be taken at any time shall at presant let alone, for fear of putting a stop to the woorke. Quansoe was very plaine with, her and told her it was a revenge apon the Anguinas but noe satisfaction to the white men, and as she had sent for them she ought to protect them and see noe harme came to them. They are now expecting the return of them sent in search¡ who if bring noe news, and that she holds her resolution of goeing up, shall accomodate the business as well as I can, &amp; dissemble my intention untell such time as I have force able to compell them to a compliance, for if she goes up through sham[e] of looseing her good name and esteem amongst the whitemen, which is her pretence, though I beleve it is the least occasion, the truth being to prevent makeing satisfaction, all concurring she ought to doe, what will not shame and revenge prompt that sex to do or act? I desier your speedy advice in the matter, and if you think fitt a more rougher course best, desier to you would sent down Captain Hansicoe immediatly to demand satisfaction in your names. If she comes away on Munday wee may gett her before the Cabbosheers parte, most of whome are against the Queen &amp; Anguinas. Hear is and will be by Munday night most of the great men of Acroome and Anguina to meet Quansoe. I shall not trouble you further at present, if any novellitye happens shall advise.</p>
<p>PS, I have sent two negroe men slaves. Pray order the Bomboy to send downe the Negroes irons I sent with the former men slaves.</p>

<p>Of the sayes I have disposed of since my being here, I have had at least five hundred turned by reason of the wormholes.

<p>Accra, nowadays the capital of Ghana, is 110 km east of Cape Coast. The RAC's establishment here, James Fort, had been founded in the 1670s and occupied continuously since then. Accra had been conquered by the inland kingdom of Akwamu ('Quamboe', etc.) in 1680, and remained subject to the latter through the 1690s.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2959"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2959""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1273"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2959"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>1</sup></a></span> The king who had effected this conquest. Ansa Sasraku ('Ahenisah'), had died in 1689, and Akwamu was now ruled jointly by his brother, called 'Basua' or 'Bansiar' in Dutch and Danish sources (this name occurring in the correspondence from James Fort in the form 'Bonisha' or 'Bonishee'),<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2960"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2960""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1274"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2960"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>2</sup></a></span> and his heir apparent, Ado ('Addo').<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2961"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2961""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1275"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2961"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>3</sup></a></span> There were also a Dutch fort (Fort Crèvecoeur) and a Danish fort (Christiansborg) in Accra, to which reference is made in this correspondence. The Danish fort was seized by Akwamu forces in 1693, but ransomed back to the Danes a year later; the seizure occurred during a hiatus in the Rawlinson correspondence, but its restoration to the Danes (in June 1694) is noted (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-1254#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3126"">no.1243</a>).</p>
<p>Accra supplied both gold and slaves (and also corn and oystershells). In the early 1680s, the main supply of gold to Accra came from Akani and Akyem ('Akim' etc.), in the interior beyond Akwamu, but by the 1690s Akani traders were no longer coming to Accra,<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2962"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2962""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1276"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2962"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>4</sup></a></span> and trade from Akyem was also frequently disrupted by disputes with Akwamu.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2963"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2963""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1277"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2963"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>5</sup></a></span> The supply of slaves, on the other hand, derived mainly from Akwamu's own military operations, and was therefore more secure; in this period Accra was thought to be supplying as many slaves <span id=""page506"" class=""page-break""><span id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2964"">pg 506</span></span>as the rest of the Gold Coast combined.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2965"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2965""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1278"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2965"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>6</sup></a></span> However, the operation of the trade was subject to the vicissitudes of King Basua's policy, with frequent interdictions of dealings with the European forts.<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2966"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2966""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1279"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2966"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>7</sup></a></span> The correspondence alludes to internal tensions within Akwamu, between its two co-rulers, which on one occasion, in 1693, came to the brink of civil war (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-1233#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3071"">no.1222</a>). It also refers to Akwamu's continuing military enterprises against neighbouring countries. Repeatedly during the 1690s, forces were dispatched to fight 'to leeward', i.e. along the coast to the east. Most of these campaigns seem to have been directed against the Adangme ('Allampo'), between Accra and the River Volta;<span class=""fragment-marker work-legend"" data-type=""fragment-marker"" sortable-milestone=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2967"" id=""legend-actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2967""><a href=""#paratextdiv-actrade-9780197263921-note-1280"" id=""actrade-9780197263921-milestone-2967"" class=""milestoneText marker""><sup>8</sup></a></span> but on other occasions Akwamu forces operated east of the Volta, in alliance with the rising power of 'Little Popo', in 1692–3 against Whydah (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-1216#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3017"">nos 1205</a> etc.), and in 1695 apparently against Anlo (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-1305#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3221"">no.1294</a>). The correspondence also documents a campaign against Kyerepon ('Accrippoone'), in the interior to the east of Akwamu in 1697 (<a href=""/view/10.1093/actrade/9780197263921.book.1/actrade-9780197263921-div2-1328#actrade-9780197263921-milestone-3282"">no.1317</a>).
