Whatever your honour is pleased to conclude on for the rebuilding I desire your honour will se nd a fitt person who may survey the charge the Company will be att either for building or rebuilding , as likewise to contrive what may be done and att the least charge and best convenience for the Royall Companys interest, that in this case I may be blameless for any extravagan .cies of charge, for I am resolv 'd not to extend the limitts of your honours order.

The 3 persons Ahenesa sent down to us tould us he designed noe harme against us, onely demanded his owne, of which at present wee are unsensible, and besides bid us beware of the Dutch, for they were all rogues and lyers. September the 2nd Ahenesas sonn Bobie came hither and made his palavora with us to say as fol.loweth: That Ahenesa hath noe demands against Mr Wendover for lying with Boque hiswife, neither did hee take any great notice of itt when wee tould his soon Bobie ofitt, onely ditto Bobie tould us his father Ahenesa demanded his due to him one[=on] his monthly saJlery, and that the Company , Mr Wendover or any in the Com.pany service should [n]ever be troubled in the least about his wife Boque. 17 To allthis Ahenesas sonn Bob ie tooke the fetish, and that hee would bring downe a trade,and wee to procure the same tooke the fetish that Ahenesas son or any hee sent to our fort should by us have and receive all civilllity whatsoever. September the 3rd Ahenesas sonn Bobie went away, with whome wee sent the aforesaid Black namedBa: Como with our orders to give Ahe nesa an account of our proceedings and whatfetish his soon Bobie hath taken in his behalfc , and that also wee desired dittoAhenesa to con.firm the same. September the 9th The aforesaid Ba: Conto returned from Ahenesa with 3 of his men whome sent usworde hee had not the least pretention either against Mr Wendover or any in thisfort, and that hee approved of the fetish his soon Bobie had taken in his behalfe andpromised allwaycs to confinn the same, and that hee had not nor never would havethe least quarrel I against the English here, and whatever stories wee heard from theDutch, blacks or any other wee should not beleivc them. Hee did assure us that ifwee would procur e him good bright musketts, powder and other goods, wee shouldnot want either for slaves, or gold, but wee should have a constant trade.

Att present all manner of trade is soe dead that at all the fo1ts here has not this two months taken 4 ounces. The reason is Ahenesa hath been out against the Arcanies and Akims, soe not any traders from any parts dare adventu re to come downe, but this day news came that he had taken the Taffo country with some few slaves, the major part of the people fled for succour to the Akims.31 This day 3 slaves was brought, 2 woemen and I man, but I bought them not by reaso n to great a price, which was 9 musquetts apeece, which in my apprehension is extravigant rates for my Masters proffitt. If Alhenesa is conquered this will certainly be a place of good and considerable trade, if not he will suffer noe Arcanie nor Akim to buy any thing here but what comes through his hands, which he makes double proffitt off, soe expect what the events will be and in the meane time hope for the best. [I] shall also foflow your Honours order in demandin g satisfaction of Ahenesa for the 100 rnusquetts.32 Also inquiied of the soulders here what man had the 50 musquetts, and theGunner Thomas Barrett inform'd me it was Quobing, and that he delivered them himselfe, which shall likewise be demanded.

I leave all the relation of affaires to his information.I have found all goods right that has bee under his management which has been allhere, but this month I found a musquett under one of the Arda's bedds, and whipthim severely for it. He confest his crime and likewise charged a free black, Ashumaone of the black souldiers, to have been in confederacy with him in stealing 9 more,which he mistrusting run away the day before, but if I can catch him I will send himaway on the Company account ,33 also 6 bares of iron which is now wanting and 1blew narrow baft which he threw over the wall when he went to turne them as theywere drying, which wee here doe by reason of a damp warehouse every month.

Imprimis, Ahenesa after his returne from con.quest did desire mee to come up and agree for slaves, which I wrote your Honour 7 and was denyed, and my not goeing there caused severall strangling4 slaves to a quantity to Tishee, where many ships have gott many slaves and gives greate rates alsoe for gold.

He demanded of mee custom ever since I was here, to which I responded I had not taken soe much money in my time, and itt was agreed hee should be paid on these conditions, that hee with his people should come downe and trade here att this fort only, and that hee should not hinder any other up country people from comeing downe. I tould him likewise that hee had been IOmonths out of his country and that l had [)Qt seen any of his people, and what reason or with what face could hee demand a bendy a month thus. He answers bee was now return'd and would performe whatever hee had promised, provided hee might be supply'd att this fort with such goods as hee wanted, which I answered as far forth as Cape Coast could supply bee should not want if I saw he fail' d not of his word. Then wee proceeded to prizes of goods and slaves, hee demanded a bendy a head for a man and 6 pezos for a woemen. I tould him I would give itt him provided bee would allow mee my prizes for goods, vizt powder 7 pezos a barrell, 5 pezos for say's, 12a for perpettuano's, 3a for brawls, 3a carpetts, 9a fine sletias, Sa course ditto, and other goods to any amount per rates.

First, as you are all men of reason what pleasure could you immagine I could take in soe unpleasant and tedious journey when itt hath been the death of one factor already, of which I had caution. Secondly, what delight could any man unless a prodigall receive in spending whatever hee had in the company of unknowne people, and such a one I am not, haveing not wherewithall to be lavish of, and likewise I went up to open the way that traiders might come to the forte and that none of his people should goe on board of ships to buy any goods nor any one for them, which I doe verry well J<now there doth, which in plaine is the mine of all these forts.

But I shall endeavour to make you sincible of the contrary,and giveyou an account of a more honourable a designe than you may or are aware of, andl doubt notmay if not neglectedprovevery advantagiousto my masters the RoyallCompany in whose service I am, and should be heartily glad and as willing asanyone to venture for their advantagemy person, as far as my life and health willpcrmitt me, under God etc. In January last past it was your pleasure to send me Cheife to Guidah on thecoast ofArda, anddid alsodeliver me a letterforMr RalphHassellCheife ofAccra,which it seemes was not delivered,39 upon which neglect your Worshipthought fillto withdrawme, andto that intentdid send MrJohn Smith, to placeMr John Winder in my stead, and me returne with Mr John Smith to Cape Coast per first oppertunity of the canoe, and also did order me to deliver whatt concernes I had of U1e Royall Company: which was soone done, for haveing nothing I could deliver nothing, but only 8 damaged barrells of powder which Captain Lawrance left, because Captain Wyborne would not buy them, those they had according to your Honours com.mands. This hard dealing is enough to breake the hearts of any one, and bath been almost tile breaking of mine in this case, and doubt not but your tllougbts are as mine, for a burnt child dreads the fire. I humbly beg your pardons, Gentlemen. The letter you are all very sincible that twas particularly about my own business, twas to order Mr Ralph Hassell to take the produce of what goods I had to dispose of tllere, for account of the Company, and although I did not deliver the Jetter, neither did I on tile other hand take the least thing to the vallue of one cracra, but left all as they were. There is neither Mr Hassell nor Mr Pley, nor any one can say I did, soe that hope this may in part give your Worship some satisfaction. I should not have doubted nor have had any feare in mee but would bave gladly delivered the letter, but having a knave to deale with all and the blanketts sticking in Mr Hassells throat,40 that I could scarce gett a word from him nor a good looke, nor victualls nor drinke, that I did expect no other, butt all the ill usualls imaginable as could be owne to a man, which was the reale cause and is the truth and notiling but the truth (as God shall helpe me). Now being put out of all imployments, and having notiling to doe but walking from place to place and spending my time in idleness, which life was a burtilen to me, and being often at Cricry [var. Guidah],41 for generally there was tile most company, always one Commander or another begging of Cap.tain Wyborne his assistance to furnish them witll slaves, for goods and gold, whoe always was ready to imbrace tlleir desires with his promises in great measure, and indeed to speake the truth was commonly as good as his word, being tilere I made a very neare inquiry into all matters; and understanding that there was a place to leward called Appa from whence he gotta great many slaves, some coming by land others by sea, made me admire that men should see their own goods goeing to this place and bring slaves for the produce, when tiley might as well tilemselves send their boats and purchase them tllemselves, for I believe if a canoe may goe a boat may doe the same (I am sure their ships wil I not faile them), but they doe soe deale on this place Guidah and Ophra that they thinke slaves are not to be hand past [var. below) these places. Then tllere is imother dependence, Captain Wyborne being there they cannot faile, wboe getting their goods into his hands makes his owne advantage, a benda a head the least price for all sorts, men, women, boys and girles. That men of reason and of understanding should see themselves soe bubled,42 I am sure tis much to the disadvantage of the Royall Company and owners, I shall instance in several particulars by and by. Seeing how causes went and nothing to do, I desired the favour of Captain Wyborne that I might goe to Appa per the next canoe, which he readily granted mee, telling me the canoe would returne in 10 days, which time I thought would not be long, and knowing that Mr Smith would not goe this month, I did adventure at which place I an1 now, of which I shall give you the following account and the great advantage that may be made on all accounts whatsoever. Appa is about 30 or 40 leagues at the most from Guidah and is very remarkab le for ships to find, there being a single cocarnutt tree standing in the middle of a small bay, and a flag staff by that one [= on] which they hang up an old clout, itt makes off to sea very woody for it is a woody place, but I shall advise the Phidalgoe to make a new St Georges flagg. The Phidalgoes towne is about 3 miles from the sea, which is incompassed round with water and small riverlett issuing from the great river, and is mightily full of ba[m]boo trees which afford wine much like unto palme wyne, of which baboos they build all their houses. There is also a very famous river that goes to Boneen,43 from whence comes all sorts of cloathes and are sold cheap for any sorts of goods. Boneen is 2 dayes journey from this place per land, all goods that comes to this place are conveyed to the Phidalgoes towne by water, they having canoes of 40, 50 and 60 foot in length. There is noe need of anyones taking care of goods when ashoare as to watch them, for the people are so just that they may be trusted with unsold gold, their honesty is to admiration, and the Phidalgoe takes all the care upon himselfe. Here is good conveniency of wooding and watering just by the seaside. These people never goe to sea in their canoes, for the river being soe large and affording very much fish as mullitts and there is one sort of fish that is large as a good handsome hoge, eats much like our sturgeon and is as good in my judge.ment, for that if any vessell intends for this place they must be prov ided with a canoe and men, which said canoe may returne fraighted with Boneen cloathes (and other sorts as tJ1e place can afford, which may be much to the advantage of tl1e Royall Company my masters. It is also the chiefest markett for slaves (or the fairo as the blacks call it),44 from whence me people of Guidah and Ophra are furnisht. Assinah voulgarly called Ardau Grandy45 and other ajacent places from whence comes most slaves are ajacent to this place, soe that slaves cannot be wanting and are not, and to be bought for a more reasonable rate then either at Guidah or Ophra; of rates shall give you an account how I have seen them bought. The Phidalgoe is very desirous of a trade and also the people. Once in 15 or 20 days you shall see the river full of canoes and like unto the River of Thames, some with slaves others with clouts, others with sheap, goats, henns, others with come etc. The Phidalgoe is a very good man, and lives in great splendour and much honoured by all his people -your trade is wholly with him and noe man elce, he takeing charge of all, soe the trouble is but small. The Cappusheers are a very good honest people, very labor ious alwayes, and for the Phidalgoe or else themselves, their business is cheife ly in building, which they doe very famously and very large houses, and as for the common people they seldome or never trouble you, for they come not within the Kin gs Court, but they are generally honest, which thing is a rarity amongst them: tis not soe at Guidah, them knaves are alwayes stealing and bringing troublesome palavoras to their King, which is not here. Goods bringing from the Appraye 46 very reasonably with abun.dance of care, and delivered safe into your house. As for the base exacting of custome as Lhe King of Guidah doth demand, I doe not as yett understand that they desire any, and I shall not make enquiry for feare of putting them in mind of such an evill habuit , but I doe believe the Phidalgo e doth expect something, and also the Cabbisheers, which will not be much . I can assure your Worship this that slaves are not wanting at this place, and could the Phidalgoe have any encouragement and his people they would make it their business to turne the trade. Also the people of Assimah or Uper Arda and several! neighbouring Phidalgoes have been with me, and beg heartily that ships may come, for it is soe far for them to go 1.0Guidah, and likewise they run I.he hazard of being panjard and robed of their goods and slaves (which are all very good reasons in my opinion). And as for the injuries done to the Royall Company, I shall instance in these particulars; Captain Thomas Woodfine, Commander of the Sarah Bonadve nture, sold the 3 peices of scarlett cloath to Captain Wyborne for 9 slaves, and also 3 pieces perpenuanoes and 1 piece of say for one, which 3 pieces of scarlett cloatb I saw sold for 22 by one Cocarham, a person that belongs to Captain Wyborne, and his [= is] brother Lo Hansco, a very honest fellow, and very willingly would be imployed in the Companys serice; and also Captain John [Woodfine] of the John Bonadventure and Daniell Gates, Com.mander of the Allapeen, sold sundry pieces of silks to Captain Wyborne, they being somewhat damaged, which the other person sold as followeth , 1 piece of yellow sarcinett slite and damaged containing 48 yards. for 5 slaves, one piece of green very slite containing 37 yards. for 4, one piece ofpinke colour and 1 piece cherry containing 37 yards for 5, one piece of skie sarcinett slite but a pleasant colour and good containing 39 yards . for 5, 1 piece of flowered colour and good containing 13[.] yards47 for 2 slaves-which goods at Guidah where blowne upon and slited as if they had cost nothing, nay upon the scarlett cloath the King spit upon it, for nae booges nae slaves, without you will pay the lwice the worth of them in othergoods . Tis otherwise here, for anything goes off, booges not coveted, but good richsilkes, and all sorts of linnins, noe one sort excepted as 1know of unless il be ironbarrs, and they shall not stick ahand, neither any other thing rather then not trade,the peop le are soe willing. And having now made you sincible of my goeing to Appa and upon whataccount, which was noe other then to see what manner of place it was and what sortof people, also if that the plac e were a place for trade or not, which were my cheiefeintentions, and noe othe r ends in the least but to make the strictest enquiry aspossibly I could, that I might be capable of givei ng account of a place that may soemuch to Lhe advantage of the Royall Company, which is the truth (as God will helpme), having given U1is accounl l sha ll leave it to your wise and prudent considera.tions and sha ll remaine here untill your furUler answer and make whal inspectionpossible I can into Uletrade; and accordingly shall act and doe as you advice. [PS] I must acquaint your worship that I have had two tedious fitts of sickness sincel have been here, which have much weakened me, but I thank God am very wellrecovered, and in a good way to gaine my strength againe. The Phidalgoe was mydocter, for every day he makes me one thing or another to take, but what it was Ican never lell, also water to gargal in my mouth, and would alwayes see me takethem before he would goe . rn perusal! of yours by Mr John Smith I understand thatMr Ralph Hassell should say that the oath which I did take upon the account of theblanketts that I was forced to doe the same, but I must be so bo ld with him as to tellhim that he is a base knave and a most horrible notorious Iyer, for all the time thatI was at Accra last I scarce changed one word with him, for he would not speake to me. And likewise Mr Pley doth confi rme the same, be knowes to the contrary, butI pilty him, he dirst doe nae other wayes. For Mr Hassells part tis like him, tis the real effects of his heart and minds, also his maxims of advice to all to deny itt and confirme it with oaths, but 1would have Mr Hassell to know that I understand myselfe better then to be made a knight of the past, or to be forced to sweare upon anyaccount whatsoever. He may sweare by the eternal! God if that he pleaseth, he never bought any blanketts from Captain John How, and Mr Pley may also sweare he never had them in possession. According lo the the oath that I did take, which I didvoluntarily , I say that Ralph Hassell Chiefe of Accra did buy from Captain John How I 02 blanketts au 3a per blankett, whoe lay at anchor off Lague, Olis was the 2nd day of Octob er ([ 16]81), and brought them ashoar e and pul them into thewarehouse in Accra fort;48 which is truth as God shall help and the whole truth etc.Being at anchor at Wyamba Caplain John How came aboard Captain ThomasWoodfine49 and saluted me per Ole salutation of informer, for Mr Hassell had acquainted him how squares had gone; and I suppose delivered the blanketts back againe, for he told me that he was fully satisfied.

I doe believe that Welch plaines would sell well here, by reason they make all their rich cloathes of them,51 soe that care must be had to u-ie severall sorts of colours, red, green, yellow, blew, purple and orange, and the Phidalg oe gave me a cl oath made of Welch pl aine which is very handsome.

Firstly: All his first comeing here from Ophra to this place, not well consider.ing the interest of your Honours in study ing and consulting the humours and dis.positions of these people, whoc will neither be slighted by a high and lofty carridgeor abused by bad language, in both of which gave too much liberty to his selfe, bywhich hee hath for ever lost the love and good will of these people, although thebreach for the present be seemingly made up, there being not one upon the placefrom the King to the poorest can afford or give him a good word.2ndly: By his becomeing debtor to one Captaine Bebc 53 for 15 slaves whichwas a long time before paid and then not to his [= Bebe's] satisfaction, I doepresume might be a great part (and by the disgust the blacks had before takenagainst him) of his being panyard, and for whatt hec may possibly say of my selfebeing concerned therein, ill was soe farr from mee that when heard itt [IJ didendeavour and partly effected the composeing of the business, and now must giveyour Honours an accompt of his suspistious asperscons cast upon mee.

Seeing hee was like to leave the place [I] did tell him if mighthave my monyes [I] would trye and endeavour to compose his business, which didendeavour and partly by my meanes itl was effected, and to what other callamnyshee may loade mee with, as seeing interlopers and the like, I doe here declare thecontrary, but can bring with good proofe the same thing upon himselfe, whicbhereunder in short shall give your Honours an account of in three articles.1st. Upon the 14th day of August past, here being in port an interloper calledLblank], one Fullwood Commander, whoe wanting some assistance, Captain Wy.borne not being here, Mr Winder did him what kindness lay in his power, by firstof all in paying his customes to the King , which was paid out of your Honourswarehouse in 9 lb of boogees and 9 yards of silke, which contracted the familliaritybetwixt them (things not here going to his satisfaction), that bee agreed to put 40slaves on board of him and soc leave your honours factory here, 8 of which was puton board, in which time Captain North came in hither with some goods for yourhonours account [and] the business was made up and declined.2ndly.

John Thorne Ophra in Arda, 28 Jan. 1682/365 ","February the 12th 1681/2Mr John Winder in the night came to Ophra and the next morning showed me your Worships order, the which I most willingly complyed with, and he forthwithdesired that the Phidalgoe mighthave notice ofit, that your Worshipand Gentlemenof the Councill had U10ughtfitt to make him Chiefe factor on the Coast of Arda, and (he] desir'd he might have bis residence here at Ophra and to be secured, otherwise Mr John Smith would have him to Guidah, he [= Smith] being the only man he was to suspect, as haveing notice of it before from Mr Spurvay.A letter of the 14thcame to Mr John Winder from the said Mr John Smith to desire Mr Winder to looke after the debts which is owing to the Royall Company,unto whomeI gave a particular account of all. The 22nd came another letter fromMr John Smith to Mr Winderintemating that Captain ThomasWoodfine had altered his mind and was resolved to take in his complement of slaves at Guidah, and wished Mr Winder to neglect noe lime but come away as soon as possible mightbe.Mr Winderhaving received this letter makes all the meanesthat might be to the Phidalgoe, telling him that Mr Smith had sent for him to Guidah with an intentto withdrawthis factory, and therefore desired he might beprotected byhim, which being granted by lhe PhidalgoeMr Winder then writes to Mr Smilhlhat he was retain'd by the Phidalgoe and could not possibly come to Guidah. MrSmith sent severall letters to him to come to Guidah and at last came himself, butwas forcedto goe back without him. I asked the reason of his being soe unwillingto goe with Mr Smith, he told me Mr Smithhad a mind to keepehim at Guidah andcome to settle herehimselfe, and that he had receivedseverallabuses by whitemenatt Guidah a11dheld il not a place fttt for a factory, in regard theyhad soe raised theprices of slaves to 25 per cent dearer then they are at Ophra.66 Mr Smith notsatisffiedwith Mr Winders staying at Ophra, lhinking the Phidalgoe had kept himby forcecontrary to his owne will, wasresolvedto fetchhim away in the night, thewhichresolution he put into practice and came to Ophra in the night with a sparehammack and men arm'd, and being without sent Francis Capell to the factory toacquaintMr Winder with his designe, anddesired Mr Winder to come to him withall speed.Mr Winder haveing receivedthis messagewentalongwithFrancis Capetlto Mr Smith, and as he went acquaintedsome of the Phidalgoes people which layatthegate (asthey doe every night)thatMr Smithwascometo fetchhim to Guidah.This notice beinggiven the townewas soone up in arms, whichMr Smith found tohls cost, and seeing he could not gett Mr Winder away return'd to Guidah againeand began comake preparation to goe to Cape Coast, which after some time pro.ceeded on his voyage. He being gone Captain Shepheard arrived about the 20th ofJune in Guidah Road, and goeing on shoarc there was forc't to send for his goods,for the Blacks would not suffer him to goe on board againebefore he had began totrade with them. Captain Shepheard then sent Mr Winder your Worships letters,which haveing received [Winder] sent Robert Chapman in a canoe on board to desire Captain Shepheard to bring his ship into Ophra road, where he would beready to dochim all the servicehe could asper order fromyour Worship,but wherehe was he could not assist him in any thing, besides if he could come might do theRoyall Company great service in it, forhere was 30 slaves owing to the Companywhich would be shipt on boardhim, or if his goods should fallshortmight be madegood byiron barrs, which with his other goods would be put off and not otherwise,but Captain Shepheard being on shoare beforeMr Winders letters came could notcomply with his desires, but writthim a Jetterand sent it by Robert Chapman whowas then on board that in regard he could not comply with what Mr Winder hadwrite him of, nevertheless he would send him his remaines to Ophra if he wouldsend the said Robert Chapman for them, and withall order him to give a receipt forwhat he received, and it would be as well as if he had did it himselfe. Mr Winderhaveingreceived Captain Shepheardsletter waswillingto goe on boardof hfm, and desired me to speake lo lhe Phidalgoe for him, but when the Phidalgoe heard he wouldgoe on board a ship in Guidah road began to be doubtfull of his returne and refer'd his answer till another lime, but Mr Winder being urgent wilh the Phidalgoe made him the more distrustfull of his comeing againe, which l told Mr Winder of but he LOldme that if I could gell leave of the Phidalgoe for him, he would become bound to me in a 200 pound bond,67and likewise would give the Phidalgoe 60 slaves, that is the 30 that he owes the Royall Company and 30 more in iron, if he returned not againe but went Oil shoare at Guidah. On these considerations the Phidalgoe granted leave with my engagemenLtogether. He went Oil board and haveingbeen on board 2 dayes but the King of Guidah heard of it, and told Captain Shepheardifhe wouldbringhim on shoarehe would givehim a slave forhis pain es, the which Captain Shepheardsoone put into practice and gott him on shoare, to the great loss of the Royall Company,for as soone as this Pbidalgoe heard of it he sent for his 30 slaves in iron, which I kept him from for severalI months and told him did believeMr Winder would come againe, and had kept them yet in the factory had not Mr Armitage sold 500 bars to the French Merchant68 and he comeing to demand them the Phidalgoe said he would be paid first the 30 slaves due to him which Mr Winder contracted, and soc forc't me to pay the 30 slaves in iron. He being paid I refused to give the French Merchant the barrs Mr Armitage had sold him till further order from your Worship. I often desired Mr Winder to take some care for my departure from this place buthe put me of from time to time, and told me would waite yourWorships further order,he not findingme guilty of any thing of what was laid to my charge. The letter that came to your Worship in Andrew Crosbies name is false, he denyes it and saith he never writ any. Mr Smith and Mr Winder both questioned him about it and had his answer. When Mr Winder was gott to Guidah I often moved my willingness to be discharged and to goe home according to your Worships order. I also desired him to take some care to send booges downc to maintaine the factory,[he] have[ing] then soe many in his hands, and not let the Companys barrs be sold at soe pi ti full a price as 3 lbs of boogesper barr,69 butneitherMrWindernor Mr Armitage would give me a:nyansweare to what I wrill, thoughseverall desired, and might have had my passage in a Dutch ship if it had not been both thcire neglects. I have been ever willing your Worships orders should be obeyed in things soe far as ever I was capable, for I hold it as great a crime to disobey lawfull authority as to take part in any unlawfull authority.My humble request to take some consideration of this place, either by sending some releife or by olber meanes to withdraw it. If it be your Worships pleasure to with.draw it, send but some goods that is vendible here to put of this iron and you mayhave the slaves sent to Guidah or elsewhere. I have sent your Worship the coppy of Mr Winders contracts made to the Phid algoe and my selfe. [Inclosure) A copy of the contract Mr John Winder made the Phidal goe of Ophra:On consideration that the Phidalgoe hath promised me to goe on board CaptainRichard Sheppards ship the St George, I doe promise not to goe on shoare atGuidah , but after some small stay on board the ship to return againe to Ophra ; and if I shall act any thing contrary to my promise , doe hereby oblige myselfe to thesaid Phidalgoe in the debt of 30 slaves, and doe give him free liberty to take thesame in iron if I shall faile to returne, in witnes s whereof have hereunto sett myhand dated this 27th day of June (1682).

8_Offra_Whydah_Vol_I_p216_258.txt,"493. John Wincler70 Guyclah, 15 March 1682/3 ","Wherea s John Thorne in his letter of the 28th January last accuseth me of thefollowing misclemeanours: lstly. That upon my arrivall at Ophra the 12th day ofFebuary 1681/2 I desired thePhidal goe that I might reside in his country and that he would protect me from MrSmith, whome I pretended was my enemy and would have me to Guidah; of which(he saith) I had advice before from Mr Spurvay.2ndly. That I received a letter from Mr John Smith the 22nd following wherein Iwas desired by him, to make all possible hast to Guidah, did acquaint the Phida Igoe that Mr Smith had sent for me with an intent to withdraw the factory from Ophra,and that I againe desir'd his protection, which being granted, he saith I wrote to MrSmith that I was detained by the Phidalgoc and could not possibly come to Guidah.3rdly. Being demanded by the said John Thorne , why I was so unwilling to goe with MrSmith when return'd to Guidah from Ophra, I answered Mr Smith had a mind to keepe me at Guidah, and come to settle at Ophra himselfe, that I had received severall abuses from whitemen at Guidah and that I thought it not a place fill for a factory, in regard the prices of slaves was exhaurted to 25 per cent more then at Ophra. 4thly. That Mr Smith came to Ophra in the night with a spare hammack, and being without sent Francis Capell to the factory, acquainting me with his designe and desireing me to come to him, which (he saith) I did, and as I went acquainted some of the Phidalgoes peop le therewith, whereupon the towne was up in arms and Mr Smith forct to goe without me. Sthly. That Captain Richard Shepheard being arrived at Guidah I desired John Thorne to speake to the Phidalgoe to lett me goe on board him, but he being doubtfull of my returne was unwilling to Jett me goe, upon which he saith I prof .fered him a bond of 100£,71 and another to the Phidalgoe of 60 slaves to be forfeited à if I did not returne, upon which consideration leave was granted to me. 6thly. That the said John Thorne did often solicite me to take care for his departure from Ophra and that I would send him booges to maintaine the factory, and not lett the Companys barrs be sold at soe pittifull a price as 3 pound of booges, to which (he saith) I never returned him an answer. To which particulars I returne these answers: To the 1st. I acknowledge I arrived at Ophra around the time John Thorne mentions , but that I had any intention to reside there I utterly deny; neither did I ever request the Phidalgoe to protect me from Mr Smith, having no other intention but to returne to Guidah as soone as I had completed my business, and acquainted the Phidalgoe with the Agent Generalls and Councills instructions; and as to what he saith that I had notice from Mr Spurvay of Mr Smiths ill intentions towards me, I call God to wittness I never received any letter from him in my life; neither doe I remember I ever soe much as mentioned his name to John Thorne. To the 2nd. I acknowledge that I wrote to Mr Smith in answer to his of 22nd February that the PhidaJgoe did detaine me, and that I had soe great a watch over me that I could not possib ly make my escape, but that it was my owne contrivance, I againe call God to wittness, tis a most notorious lye, and I hope not to be credited; since Thorne doth attest in the 5th article, that I went on shoare at Guidah, and forfeited bonds I had given for my returne. To the 3rd. I acknowledge I did often say that I thought Ophra more convenient for the Companys factory then Guidah, by reason of the cheapness of carrying goods to the factory from the waterside was not soe great, and that slaves were to be had there at a far lower rate. As to what he saith that I told him of Mr Smiths designe to keep me at Guidah and settle himself at Ophra, I doe attest that the said John Thorne did endeavour to perswade me Mr Smith bad such a designe, which I never credited, knowing he did it on purpose, to alienate my affections from the said MrSmith. 72To the 4th. l can safely take my corporall oath, that when I went out oftlle factoryto Mr SmiUl, I did it with as real a designe to make my escape with him to Guidahas ever I did any thing in my life, and might have gon away had not Thorne sent theBlacks to panyare us. To the 5th. I acknowledge il true, and that I did give a bond of l 00£ to John Thorneand of 30 Slaves to the Phidalgoe for my returne to Ophra, without which I couldnot possibly escape, and here I des ire John Thornes roguery may be taken noticeof, for ifhe had noe designe to prevent my goeing away, why did be make me givehim a bond to assure him of my returne.To the 6th. I confess rnever sent John Thorne any booges, it being contrary to myorders to send any goods or any person there till he was gon off. ",,1,493

John Winder Guydah, 24 June 1683 ","Your severa ll letters of the 17th and 19th of Apr ill, with those of the 10th and 12thof May, lyes now before mee, haveing in pursuance to your orders therein specified,don my utmost endeavour for the dispatch of the Royall Companys ships that are lately gon from hence, and should have ere now dispatcht the canoe with advicehad the weather been a little more favourable, but the canoemen have been forct to stay some time to repaire the canoe, muc h damag'd by her often oversetting in theseboysterous seas . I am most heartily sorry 1 am Foret to give you account of theunhappy misfortune befaJlen the Royall Company by Captain Lowe and Woolli.fords ships being taken, as also per the loss of the Blessing. I shall forbeare totrouble you with every particular circumstance hereof, because itt is largely ex.press'd in the inclosed from Cap tain Lowe to theAgent, 73 and only acquaint you inthe gcnerall that the 16th ultimo in the evening the two pyrates mentioned in yourletter of the 12th ditto came downe to this roade, and tooke Captain Lowe, whoemade some smaJI resistance. Captain Rickards people cult their cable and went outof the roade, but before the ship came ashoare tooke the gold out and left her, which[ship] is lost, and not anything saved out of her. The mens intent was to run awaywith the gold, in order whereunto they gott aboard the Dutchmen in Ophra roade,but by U1e endeavour of Captain Rickard and myselfe and some small matter giventhe Phidalgoe for his assistance (whoe I must needs say was verry helpfuH to us)part of itt is recovered, and one bulse containing 28 marks, 3 ounces and 7 anglessent the Royall Company by Captain Woolliford. The rest Captain Rickards hascarried with him in the Merchants Bon adventure, whoe departed this roade 5 dayessince. Captai n WooJlifords men left the ship, which the pyrates tooke the next morning with all the gold in her, they pretended they would have fought but that 12 of their guns were in the hould, which was the occasion of their flight.74 Perhaps ill may be immagined that itt was my fault hee was not gon off with his complement before, but I call God to wittness I did my utmost endeavour, as Captain Lowe and Rickard will justifie to the Royall Company, and doe affirme that would hee have been ruled by mee hee might have been dispatcht. Att my arrival! with him, I found the trade much altered in my absence, the people craveing to have the measure for booges altered, and the price of slaves in many goods to be advanc'd, which I refused to doe, ill being your express order to depress the price, and not to advance itt,75 by which meanes I bought but SOslaves in 3 weekes, but when I had brought the _people to their former customes and they were content to sell their slaves att the old rate, Captain Woolliford came ashoare, and in a great passion tooke the business out ofmy hands76 and immediatly chang'd the measure and brought up a custome of shakeing itt, whereby ilt is become neare 90 pounds, and farther gave 3 fine sletias and halfe, which was never before more then 3, the like in allejars halfe a peece more then usuall,77 whereupon I demanded the cargoe ashoare which you were pleased to consigne mee per bill of loading, but in the presence of Captain Lowe and Captain Rickard, hee absolutely refused to deliver itt to mee, saying that haveing possession hee had 11 points of the law, and that hee would make use of that pa.rt of itt which was most ready to buy Negroes, the rest bee would deliver mee when hee had his complement, since which the pyrates came downe, by whome he says he was plundered and the goods lost, though I can prove that pa.rt of the ca.rgoe consign'd to mee was sent to windward in his boate without my approval!, which was sunk per the pyrates, and for anything I know, might be a greate occasion the ships were taken, for the people in the boate inform'd the pyrates in what posture the ships lay, with their yards and topmasts downe, and many of their men on shoare. 1 have acquainted the Royall Company all large herewith78and have given them cop pie of his bill of loading for the goods, with bills of lioading for the slaves bee said he had aboard, and those aboard Captain Lowe, the same you will receive enclosed, and have likewise sent others to the Royall Companys factors in the West lndias according to your order. I found Mr Armitage ready and willing to comply with your order in all things, and doubt not would have been verry helpefull to mee had hee lived, hee departed this life the LSthultimo, baveing laine sick above 10 days, and by mee and others often advised to settle his estate, and make up his accounts with the Company, which hee neglected to doe, however after his decease in the presence of scverall English men, I inventory'dwhat concerns of his was in the factory, and have taken itt into my possessio n, ofwhich the Roy all Company and his freinds in England shall have a just accompt. [have now no person with mee whom I dare trust (excep t William Belwood), have.ing sent Mr Still to Ophra, and the rest that came downe with mee rfind to be suchsottish fellowes, that I dare not be out of the fact0ry an houre unless I leave Belwoodatt home, for which reason I most humbley intreate your favourable constructionfor my non complyance with your order in sending him up, for I ca n at present aswell spare my right hand as him. Captain Quow hath been au Ophra, being orderedby mee to proceed according to your instruction, hee will give you an account ofthe Phidalgo's answer to his pallavora. I likewise desired Captain Rickard to ac.quaint him with every circumstance of your order, and hee tells me that the PhidaJ.goe replyed that the first ship of the Companys that goes thither shall hav e Thorneaboard, provided they will carry him to England and not to Cabo Corsoe, and thathce will comply with all your demands whensoever the Company begins to con.tinue their trade with him. Ifl might advise, I think ill would not bee amiss to order one ship thither for tryall, and accordingly tbe Royall Company may pr oceed withthese people. Mr Windover continues still at Appa about 15 leagues to leward ofthis place.79 I have informed Captain Wyborne according to your order. that hee [=Wendover] is considerab ly in the Companys debt and that ifhedetaines him itt willbe att his own perrill, to which hee returned that hee was not anywise imployed byhim, and promised mee to use his endeavour to gett him heither, when he doth Ishall comply with your order in sending him to Cabo Corsoe. The present you werepleased to send the King of Guydal1 was thankfully received per him, with many promises of continuing a faire correspondence with the Royall Company, but ifmasters of ships have liberty to give what they please for their slaves and spoyletrade au their pleasure, the endeavours of the factors they have will be frustrate,and this place in short time of noe advantage to them. Andrew Crosbie went off inCaptain Churchey, and Robert Chapman is dead. Captain Wyburne is lately re.turned from a place called Abree, about 16leagues to windward of Guydah , where hee hath been about 6 weekcs buying slaves for Captain Booth, an interloper. 80 Iunderstand iu is a good place for slaves, and doe know that Wyburne intends to settle a Whiteman there, but had I your order I would prevent him, or au leastwise share the trade of that place by hoysting a flagg there for the Royall Company. The cheife goods they covett are booges, tapsells, allejars and pintado's. I have enclosed return 'd your letter to Captain Waugh, who was gon off the coast before the pyrates came downe. I heare he gotthis slaves att Quitto, a place about 5 leagues to leward of the River ofVallta. 82 Hee came not downe to Guydah, but I am credibly inform'd hee sent mee a letter which Captain Woolliford intercepted and never came to my hands, soe can give you noe further accoun t of him. Captain Lumley arrived here two dayes since, whoe I doubt not may have his comp lement in 10 dayes, he givei ng the same rates that others have don before him, without whic h nothing is to be don, unless these people see that wee can send our ships to Ophra. Had I a good supply of booges, I might probablely, when ships are absent, bring them to the old rate, and I am sure, could in 10 dayes time, noe sh ips being here, purchase a good parcell of slaves for the next ship that came . The goods most in request att present are booges, corrall, white baftas, broad pintado 's, white ground, allejars, sletias, white pautkaes, and brass panns. If your Worship would be pleased to entrust me with a small parcel! of each, itt shaJI be my greate cMe to imploy them to the utmost advantage of the Royall Compa ny, and desire that I may have a proportionable part in booges, for without halfe in halfe noe slaves are to be had, and I doe hereby reiterate the promise I made to you att Cabo Corsoe of being faithfu l\ to my masters and not to convert their stock to the use of interlopers. 495 . Petly Wyborne Guydah, 26 June 1683 Yom letters of the 30th December and 23d March I have received, which binds me soe much to serve you that I shall never be able to performe my duty, but will to my power. l have never refused the Companys service nor I never will, but truely without a verry great loss I cannot leave this place in a little time, not soe soon as to have oppertunily to waite upon you au Cabo Corsoe before you goe, if you goe when your first three yeares is out. In what I can be serviceable to the Company here, I will and doe itt faithfully, The Dutch are seUeing a factory att Popoe, which they have had formerly, ill is 8 leagues from this place.83 I have an acquaintance about 8 leagues to windward of itt.84 The cheife people have obliged themselves to mee, I know itt is a place that in a short time would be verry convenient for the Company, being well managed, there is noe gold but there is aggree85 and slaves, come always is plenty; I have some trade with them, I send from Guydah to this place by river.86 If I can serve the Company in setUeing a factory for them and you are pleased to send a quallified man or two for that purpose, I will not question the doeing of itt.

The admirall clapt our ship aboard and after fireing many broad sides and valleys of small shott supprized our ship, the slaves on the deck 150 and my caske to c1eare my hold. Come with the King's jack, ensigne and pennant, wounded 7 of my men, although they made no resistance. Entered 150 men. My mate cutt the cable, upon which hee cutt his and then laid her aboard upon the luff, att which time my people yeilded the ship. Captain Rickards his people cutt their cable and loosed the fore topsaile and put to the shoare, but before shee came ashoare, quited the ship, tooke out the gold and lett the ship and slaves drive ashoare, the which is lost and not one thing saved out of her. Captai n Woollifords men quited their ship and left their gold aboard, the which the pyrates found all the next morning and an English woeman and the cooke. Att this action Captain Rickards, Woolliford and my selfe in the country purchaseing our slaves, which Woolliford might have had his slaves long before but much disobliged the blacks, though hee raised the price of booges att least IO pounds in a slave, and told the Blacks that I was comeing downe which made them keepe their slaves for mee, which I had 150 aboard and 150 ashoare, but not goods ashoare to pay for them, and I was to be dispatcht in 9 dayes more had this not happened , but now my ship is soe much disabled that I feare shall hardly carry her to the lndias, all my low masts shott, soe that all the fishes and provisions I can make will hardly hould, all but 3 shrouds on one mast and 5 on the other gon, my foremast shott; [they have] taken all my sailes, good provisions, cordage, arrnes and powder with aJI my cl oaths, gold and what was proper for them as they thought of the Company goods, as allejars, chercolees, pintado's, attlases, muzlin; and what booges on my deck and in my boate to goe ashoare, which was 6 caske, [they) throwes overboard. The next day they seized all my officers to the gunnell to shoote to death to confess for more gold, but only shott my gunners mate to death, and the other which was prevented by the English pyrates that was aboard, otherwise all the rest had dyed. Captain Rickards hath used much dilligence in looking after his gold, which was carried by his men and boate to Ofra aboard the Flemings, but broake open and greate part of itt divided amongst them, and on the news to the Flemings two of them weighed and most of his men gon with them. Hee hath gotten part of it againe and 28 marks sent home to the Company per Captain Woolliford, who sailed 2 dayes since. I have now 423 slaves on board on the Companys account and 25 on my mens account , for when the pyrate had quited the ship and had watered his ship out of her, my men desired him to give them something towards their loss , upon which bee gave them my ship, goods and slaves for their owne proper use, and ordered them that if I agreed to itt they should fire 7 gunns, if not att 8 the next morning hee would come aboard and burne her, upon which the next morning they demanded my ship, goods and slaves and to gett her to St Thoma and sell her and divide the money. I answered that itt was not in my power to give nor theirs to receive, but if they would goe about their business and refitt the ship I would find out some way to consider their loss, upon which I told them I would gett creditor for 25 slaves and send for the Factor off, whoe should allow itt and give the Company an account , and that I beleeved 25 slaves would make good all their, loss and desired them to consider whether or noe that was not a safer way, then to be like the pyrates , upon which after many disputes they fired 7 guns, and after the man of warr weighed after haveing been here 4 dayes, soe that I sent for Mr Winder aboard and satisfied him of the thing and hee told them hee would assist them with a letter to the Company to that purpose, upon which they went to worke and in 12 day's time I gott my ship in a pretty good condition and went ashoare againe. In which time Captain Woolliford bought all his slaves but how many I cannot tell. His ship was only taken by 3 prisoners which the pyrate sent aboard and brought the White woeman and the cooke and all the gold aboard. Hee saith hee hath Jost greate quantity of goods, but I am sure he hath much abused Mr Winder and pretends all that goods that you sent downe to his factory is lost, and had not Captain Rickards and my brother Woolman left him [= Winder] something could not have supported. Hee hath been veny dilligent in getting part of Captain Rickards gold and my slaves, and now recovered of his sickness very serviceable to the Company. The people of this place are verry kind to him and hee obliges them well, but itt is my opinion that if you doe not send for the time forward as many ships to Ophra as this place the Companys trade will be spoyled, for after our loss when wee brought the remaines of goods ashoare the blacks plundered as well as the pyrates and could gett no satisfaction of them, and the people of Ophra att this time doe promise that if you will send ships there wee shall have a good trade, and I well know there the prizes are settled and 20 per cent less then here, for they grow upon every ship here, soe that if you think convenient to Jett Mr Winder goe there and order a seacond or more to that factory and 2 or 3 to this, the two places will strive to outvey the one the other. Your advice to us came 12 houres after our ships was taken, and they stayed by the way att a place called Abrew, some 18 leagues to windward of this place, where Captain Wyborne was getting of slaves for Captain Booth, 103 and that they went on board Captain Booths ship, which gave the pyrate notice that they were a canoe for advice , upon which the pyrate weighed after them and outsailed, otherwise might have had 24 houres notice, for itt was the 17th day of May they came down and your letter of 5 dayes date. If my brother Thompson and brother Collins be with you pray remember my love to them and tell them I would have them goe home, for their ship and goods is given to the merchant of the greate Fleming the pyrate tooke, and about 2,000 pounds worth of goods more, and that the merchant promis'd mee to goe for Holland and that he would send the ship and her concerns for England to the owners.

I told them that the goods were none of mine and that I could not give them away, but I seeing that here was about a l 00 people upon the island that was come over from the maine in a small time, fear'd that they would goe and take the vessell, there being noe more then my mate and one man and a boy aboard .

About a week since there came Yankee from his croom with all his men in arms and other Antea Cabusheers with there men in arms all to Succondee town, bringing a great complaint to Captain Assum that the Cheife of Sbumab 87 had been up Shumah river88 into the ldooms cuntrey and had carryd two canoes loaded with powder and shott and arms for the ldooms to come down to destroy the Antea people, upon which they went up in a pallaver to the Dutch Cheife who gave them many fine words and perswaded them it was noe such thing, so after they had been with him they came to me to know if we would assist them and to desire me to write for more gunns, to which 1gave them many faire promises , which very well sattisfied them, but in two dayes affter there came one !doom man down and told them all the pallaver was falce, be said the Cheife of Shumah was there but he came to sell those goods, and that the Idooms had panyard them and would not pay him for them, upon which they were all sattisfied and went to their crooms. Now whether it might be policy of the Dutch to sent that man down I know not, nor yett can I give credditt to the blacks, but the occasion of my writeing is to know whether if at any time such a thing should suddenly happen your worship would have me side with the upland people, or watterside people, or whether to resist either of them, for although we live among the Antea people yett the upland people are our merrchants. I also desire your worships advice about letting the Antea people in our Castle, which I understand they all depend upon, if wars should happen, whjch I fear would be very ill convenient without it were two or three of the old Capusheers, for the Dutch will certainly side with !dooms and tbese being a sordid rugged people ifwe should lett them all into our forte and the Dutch resist them they would overpower us and fire at the Dutch from our forte, and although I cannot credclitt any such thing, yet least it should unexpectedly happen I humbly desire your worships advice in itt.

Accordingly as you wrote me I have endeavored to sell barrs at 22 per bendy, but have not sold one nor cannott, which is a great hinderance in the sale of other goods. I could have sold a quantity of barrs at 24, whereas now the Dutch has the mony , so pray your answer. [PS] Just now the enclosed letter arrived in my hands. 69 ",1687-07-15 00:00:00.000000,2,539

7_Charles_Fort_Anomabu_Vol_II_p192_237.txt,"541. Ralph Hassell Anamaboe , 27 July 1687 ","Whereas on Satterday last, being the 23th of this instant July, the Cappusheers of Anamaboe (I then being Chief there) demanded a case of brandy as an accustoma1y dashee at their new year as they called it, that is at their cutting of their small com, which at first I denyed to them, and that I know no such custome and that I would be satisfyed first from you whether it wou ld be allowable , by reason I would give no ill presidents [= precedents ] for the time to come, their answer was that ifit was not accustomary and allowed ofby my predecessors and fo1111erAgents and if not by you they would pay for it, and on consideracon of which I did deliver them a case of rume, with which they went out of the gates seemingly well contented. Some small time after they were out of the gate they sent for me to render thanks for the same, and as it was their new year all Chiefs did use to drink with them. Not in the least imagining they had any design or prejudice of ill against me, I did go out. I had not gone six yards from the Castle wall without the gates but presently unsuspectedly a great number of Blacks interveened me and the gate on purpose to hinder mee from returning again, as I since found true. I then went to the Cappusheers, which satt under the wall about 7 or 8 yards farther, they desired me to sitt down, which I did, then they began long storyes, saying that at my going there I promised to be kind to them. I replyed, I never was otherwise. They answered that I would not take cracra mony as others had done before me, and that I would take no pawnes nor trnst them, 70 and that the English men were not so kind to them as the Dutch, for that wee [i.e. English] all loved the Fetuers better than the Ffanteeners, and that the Ffetuers were their enemyes, and that they [i.e. the English] might be better aided at Cabo Corso than at Anamaboe, and that J should not tarry there no longer; to which Jmade this answer, that I had orders not to take their cracra mony, it was so bad, and if I should take it it would occasion more bad mony to be made and brought to me, which I must make good, and that it behooved me to take none but what was good, and what others had done should not be a president for me. I told them likewise that I could not take pawns, knowing that they do not care to redeem them , and that for severa!l years Mr Thelwall had pawnes from severall of them and that time the Royall Companyes mony lay dead, and so they would do again ifl took any pawnes , and as for trusting of them I had to my losse done to much, which I have made good to the Royall Company, and as to the Dutch loving them better than the English, replyed they bad more reason for they were ever treacherous to us, as instance their selling Conuantine from us to the Dutch, 71 and as for being more kind to the Fetuers, though their enemyes, [they] were more faithfull ever than they, yett for their mony they might be supplyed as as well as they , for they have nothing without money , and what had I done that should so much incense them to that height. They still persisted in the same story, and that I should not go into the Castle again but I should instantly go to Cabo Corso, and that they would strip me naked and beat me as they had Mr Nightingale, unlesse I would send for an anchor ofrume. I well knowing that their crue lty infinitely transcends humane apprehensions, condescended to save myself impunified, and that I might go into the Castle again, which they would not permitt unlesse I left Mr Walker behind me as a pawn and that severall of them might enter with me. This was all done under the Castle walls where no damage could be done to them by any gunns, the fort being so ill contrived and so weakly manned that they esteemed it invallid. This I humbly offer to your consideracons and will averr to be truth, which is the only reason of my returning to Cabo Corso. Withall that their resolves are that I shall never return to Anamaboe to reside there. To all tlhat is above and within writt , I attest to be nothing but what is truth.

[1685] 6 ","This accompanys Captain Henry Wood in the George Sloop, who I perceive was not ordered here, but by necessity of the badness of his rudder come to an anchor to have some iron work made for the safe gaurd thereof, but be that was ordered to call here, which was Mr Obery, 7 was so well fitted to serve the Company that either he had nothing or could or would not spare us any thing, soe that if the Company ffactoryes be in never soe much distress, they are not to supply or assist us, by reason of breach of orders. If they had belong to any other nation or place eke I might I beleive a gott something out of them. It bath been a custome in former times and I think alwaies till now, and am sure tis alwaies expedient that when a vessel I of the Companys is orderd for the Madearahs for wine, to France for brandy, or to Barbadoes for rum, that soon affter the arrivall of such liquors all the ffacloryes use'd to be supplyd with a stock according to their expence, some a butt some more, at the Companys price. Now that I beleive and am inform'd that your Honour is alwayes in action and therfore your head taken up with many other of the Companys concern es and troublesome bussiness; but I am almost certaine that their is some other heads about you that should be ease to you, are more taken up with pot, boul [= bowl] or glass concemes than anything of the Companys business, and if they can but swill their gutts , will care for none eke, therefore tis my advice when next His Excellency as they call it knights them againe it may be Sir Tymothy Dolittle, Sir Roger Doe Nothing , Sir Andrew Love Nobody, and soe forth and with this addition, (but drink). Had they been Orambarrowes [sic: = ?], l would have excused it. Here for our necessary expense have been forced to give two slaves an ancor for brandy , and canot have enough [even] so, and I think tis reason that these before mentioned knights should pay for this extravagant charge , it being not the Company fault but theirs, for not mentioning such a expedient to your Honour. 0 fine brave councellors, you know that the ffactory was burnt and great part of the Companys goods , 8 and noe ship hath been here since that had a sufficient cargo to leave any remaynes; and that I am at great charge in building, 9 and twi ll be affine creditt for the Company, that l must be fforc'd to borrow goods to supply our wants of the Ffrench ffactory or worse of Captain Wybwàne, which I must doe ifl canot perswade Mr Obery or Mr Wood to put some oftbeircargo ashore, which I am affraid they will not, it being a breach of orders, because I am not a Boneen or Bit 10 Negroe &ca., JI though without orders I adventure to supp ly the Company ships with any neces saryes or assistance that I can. I remember before I came out of England and since it was the generall discow-se of Comanders that they cou ld not be supply' d with any thing from the Companys factors, but from Captain Wyburue, which was true enough, but now it is quite contrary, I want no supp ly for ships but have allready, but I want some from them. Captain Wilcox and Captain MinghamI 2 dyed here , the ffirst the 28th of March, the other the zd August 1685. Captain Lowder and Captain Rickard had great sickness here, particularly Captain Lowder and lay a long time here from the 22 April to the 26 July, Negroes then being very scarse, by reason of some pallaver up in the cuntrey, 13 but now are very plentifull againe, for the ffirst day I went up to the kings town 14 to mark Negroes for Captain Mingham I mark'd 59 slaves, 51 men and 8 wome n, but Captain Lowder and Captain Rickards went both we ll away, but shorte of their comple.ment of Negroes considerab ly by reason of short cargoes_ Is By reason of the death of John Mingham here is bad news that the doctor 16 with GabrilJ Cloise, Captain Woods mate, is run away with the ship and 170 Negroes of the Company without signing bills of load ing. 17 The doctor, who commands , saith they designe to be honest , and deliver the Companys Negroes at tbe Companys ffactors at Jamaico, but whethe r they will or not I canot say, but I fear they are and will be rouge s, if U1ey can conveniently. Affter the death of the commander Tadvised them to goe up to Cabo Corso as you may se by this inclosed paper , whicb I sent to them by Mr Wortley , 18 who read it aboard and [they] seemed to be all well sattisfied. In order thereunto [I] put Negroes on board and was making all the dispatch J could my selfe, when Mr Obrey came down and ashore , for 2 or 3 days could not gett a canoe of, in which time they had seduced Charles Langli 9 and got him aboard and con:find him, and then with resolution the ships company declared they would keep him and proceed on their voyage to the West India according to charter party , but affter some time Charles Langly got away from them on board the Jacob Pink againe , where he continues . Then the doctor declared himselfe able, and said be could carry the ship himselfe to Jamaica , and desired bis bills of loading to sign, which I writ and sent aboard, but before he had signed them Captain Wood came to an anchor and came ashore to gett his iron work done for his rudder, and the same afftemone being the 15th September his mat e Gabriell Cloyse went aboard and 10 the clock that night they weighed and went away without signing. Captain Wood ordered if they offered to sayle to ffire at them, and accordingly that they did 2 guns with shott , and Doctor Thomas Byre , who bares the command of the Jonas , fired l gun with shott at them againe and went away. The winner hath liberty to laugh, the loosser to speak, the agrcived to complayn, therefore I hope you will not be angrey at my just complaint, since I am much agreived . [PS] The Company surely thinks I have a great stock by me, or eke they would not mention in their charter partyes as if their ffactors here might hav e 3 or 400 Negroes ready to put on board every ship, it being worded after this manner, that if our factors at Ardra 20 shall have your complement of negroes reddy to put on board , then you shall deliver him your cargoe ashore , and it can not be possible , that I can purchase soe many slaves , without goods 21 and you will perceive by the inclosed account that I had not much left last June , and unless your Honour contrive some conveniency I canot possible gett a letter carried up more than once a year .22 Therefore 1 ought to have a sufficient supply of all things , by[ = but] all ships that comes here are so pillaged at Cabo Corso that they bring nothing with them . Captain Low der complayned of the coast [= cost] for se lling his brandy at la per gallon, but here would not spare any for 2a per gallon nor 4a per [gallon] , and Captain Rickard would have bought brandy here if it were to be sold. I am very angrey with the severall swill gutts that your Honour hath about you that have dnmk up all the ships stock and stores. For above twelve months time, noe ship hath brought brandy, sugar, wine and all complayn it went away at Cabo Corso. If you please to send Captain Wood down here with sutiable goods, whose ship will be able to carry up slaves and cloth23 and turne up along shore in 3 weeks time in all probabi lity, especially between this and the month March, being the best time of the year, 24 and I beleive her voyage may turne to as good account as where she can be sent. I had not given any consent to come to Ardra but the Company promised me a packet vessell to be constantly sent between Cabo Corso and this place, and although she be not fitt for it by reason of the defects of Captain Benda lls judgement ,25 that is noe sure arguement that I shall have none, but ley here to starve or be fforced to shift for myselfe. Ifl could have a vessell down here, and goods and advice beforehand, I could have slaves and cloths ready to put on board without staying her longer than takeing them in.

John Carter Whidab, 1 March 1686 ","Yours by the 4 hand canoe were all received and they were speedy in their passage, but they would not returne in [so] small a canoe but stay' d for mine and Quashee, that Captain Low hired at Annamaboe, 30 which now goes in company together. I likewise received all yours, I suppose, by severall ships; but could not answer them reddily by reason the ships did not return to Cabo Corso, for their has been 110 opertunity that I could here of or procure butt I have writ up since the l 0th of March last twelve months past, though I have endeavour'd and profferd good encourage.ment, yet could I not perswade any canoemen to goe up, baveing been well supply'd and furnish'd with necessaryes, [and a] canoe for that purpose, and within two months I hired 30 canoemen , that our own ships brought down, to goe up, and on a suddain for noe reason that I know the most of them ran away, and disperced them selves amongst the Mine canoes. 31 Therefore unless you can here [= hire] and oblige a gang of canoe men to come down and reh1rne imediately, it is allmost impossible to perswade them to goe up at any other time than about the hennitan time, 32 and this I beleive is not unknown to Mr Winder. Notwithstanding you seem to admire in severall of your letters that you here not from me, but indeed (I] have the gratist cause of admiration , first that the Company at my request and desire should buy a small vessell and send her out on purpose and purely for an advice boat from Cabo Corso to this place and to pass and repass , as occasion required and time would pennitt, for the better settlement and government of this factory , but since the time I came here niether shee nor any other vessell have sent, though I have been inforrn'd by severall, that somtimes one vessell was designed to be sent down and other times another , [so] that I did still live in hopes. Now there is three reasons for such a vessell to be sent, first because the Company did order it; secondly because the destruction by fire did request it; thirdly because you did not here from us in soe long time. Twas requested a vessell should have been sent to se in what condition we were in, I mean the factory was in, which might very well be thought to be bad enough after such distraction [sic] by fire and no house to put our heads in but ai1 ioterloper. 33 Before I came out of Eng land I told the Company we could send advice home with more certainty at some times of the year than to Cabo Corso, therefore desired the said vessell and they granted it. The last letter that Mr Winder wrot to Cabo Corso to Agent Greenhill I saw when l was there, 34 wherein he advised the Agent that 500 iron bars was proper to be sent down in a cargo , and since that time very few ships have brought out any and then but few in a cargo, which must of necessity make them a commodity. Notwithstanding all this Mr Winder hath advised those ships that had any to dispose of them before they came here. The last he so advised was Mr Elwes ,35 who by reason of that advice sold all his bars to windward , and did not bring one here, as if purposely he[= Winder] designed to doe us all the ingury he can, which 1admire att. l doe admire that the Affrican Merchant, the Company[ s] one [= own] ship comeing to tbe Company[s] own factory , should be stint'd to a short cargo and with a great quantity of large bouges , soe much behinde merchantable, that it was IO slave loss to her cargo in slaves ,36 and J admire the said ships cargo was not 37 Iconsign'd to me, the reason for it would be as wellcome to meas a markofgold. am shure you must allow my expences here to be greater than any mans on the Coast , and (excepting the Agent) my sallery and security greater than any persons than on the Coast, as [IJ imagaine , but for these and other favours from you Gentlemen at Cabo Corso I thank you for, as sending down liquors for factoryes expences , and a convenient supply of goods and the great conveniency of the advice boate. The last letter l sent you by the canoe was the 10th of Ma rch last, and that and the former gave you an account that I wanted goods, and you have sent me none since but a little in Captain Lowder. I have no goods of the Companyes, but am forc'd to make use of the estate of deceas'd persons and my own to maintain the factory, therefore canot make up my account till I am supplyd . I hope shall not be distress'd like Deans to pawn the factory,38 therefore I request you will be please to order down by a speedy conveyance, and [sic] a large stock of goods, that I may be furnished to purchase a quantity of Negroes reddy against any ships arrivall; and the good I desire are, vizt I 000 iron barrs; 20 barrells bougees; 100 long cloths; l 00 white bafts; 100 allejars; I 00 pintadoes, white ground; 600 pautkeis; 6 pieces of scarlett cloth; 2 pieces redd cloth; 40 red perpetuanoes; cmnll [= coral], if any; good rangoes, if any; lemmons past, white and purple, as big as pease; large christall; christoll stripd white; sletias, if any. If the George sloope be arrived at Cabo Corso, as I hope she may, 1 request your Honour will please to order her down, with what goods you please to send downe, and if you can furnish her with 6 or 8 oars for rowing, 1 will [put] 20 or 30 stout slaves one [= on] board, who will quickly be entstrnckt'd to row, which may be a great help to her comeing up. If soe accomplished I would not in the least doubt of getting up in her in 14 or 20 days time, and and I long to se Cabo Corso, therefore hope there will be none soe unkind as to putt a stop, or delay any means, that may tend to soe reasonable happiness. Gentlemen I came out of England in good equipage as to security sallery and great promises from the Company, with a small vessell, called a smack, which was brought and sent out purposely for my use, as Cheife of this factory, well knowing the necessity of such an expedient at this place, now depriv'd of the conveniency of the own[= one] and my expectation being wholly frustrated in the performance of the other, pray doe not mock at my misfortunes , because I am not soe happy as to be at Cabo Corso, where some have had the advantage of rising to greater preferment than they came out for. You will doe me a great favour if you will give me your sentement what you think the Company designd when they sent out a vessell and call 'd her the advice boat or packett vessell for Whiddah. Captain Bridges is now arrivd the 4ç' March , and in your letter by him you tell me of severall Mine canoes come up, which I beleive to be true, but they doe nott goe of from hence but from Pickaninee Popo , 39 [so] that I am not acquainted with their departure, but ifl were, I should not have write by them by reason I have at the same time been sending up my own canoe, which now is above 3 months past and so long delayd by reason of the roguishness of the canoemen, that I had spoake to and hired, a list of their names and places here send inclosed. I have at all times of the year indeavour'd to gett canoe men and profer'd them any cano they would take, and 7 and 8 cloths a man to goe up, but could not prevaile till now [with] those canoemen that comes up, and all the reason I can gather is that the Comanders are put to hire canoemen themselves, and by that means the canomen think themse lves noe waies relayted to the Company; but when the Commanders discharges them think themselves abused by me, I suppose, because they have not the canoe given them, though at the same ti.me I offer them a canoe if they will goe, but they will be sole masters thereof, for the canomen generall[y] importune the Comander to give them thee canoe when the ship is slaved, which the Commanders for the most part grant upon their good behaviour, which is but seldom. 40 Now by reasons they gett not the canoe J suppose they impute it to my fault, of all which I pray informe your selfe of Mr Wortley and Unguah, who comes up by this canoe. It may be you may think 1 am passionate, but I am sattisfied 1 have just reason to complaine, but to conclude I hope you will by first conveyance be pleas' d to answer my request as far as the Castle affords , and if the George sloop doe not arrive time enough, then by some other convenient vessell, that she may returne up with account of what state we are in. I am in great want of white men, haveing only my selfe, Mr Wo1i ley and Mr Smith, and here should be 6 at least. If you please to send any down lett them be good men that will not dey [= die] with laziness. I here Samuell Chambers was comeing, I think he may doe well for own[ = one]; since the writeing I have an ill ca1Tccter of Samuell Chambers. What I cant think ofto write Mr Wortley will give your Honour to understand. What goods wilJ be sent down, if any is not packt up I desire they may be put up in sheet chests, and will pay the warehouse keeper for them if they are at the accustomed price, which was halfe an angle per chest, then if their be 40 or 50 chests I shall gladly pay for them. Captain Woodfine41 is above halfe slaved and doubt not but he will be compleated in less than ten dayes more. The Orange Tree is arriv' d and I hope will be dispatcht in a month or 5 weeks time at farthest, but he also hath a shorte cargo. I should be glad to se Mr Winders computement of the cargo of these two ships that are the Company[s] own, for I can not understand how he makes it outt. I want to se Caho Corso my selfe to discourse fully of mine own business, which I hope shall accomplish some small time . In the intrim refer you to Mr Wortley and to your own serious consideration of what I have write. PS . Since now you may perceive I cannot send up but once a year , if you have not the conveniency of sending down a small vessell please to order down canomen with positive comands to return , that you may have a better account ofaffaires here .

TheFfrench hath brought a great quantity of iron barrs , therefore advise the ship not to bring to many , but if the quantity before mentioned for the factory I shall have the longer time to put them of, and they will not damnifie.

If these goods bee wanting, or if nott, twill be convenient to putt some good goods that will sell well for gold, and the gold will bee as good as bouges and purchase slaves att a more reasonable rate, and all men too, both with the whites and blacks, and this Ile make good halfe her quantite of slaves and more in good men, may bee had al 6 pease per head .soThe canoe now will follow very speedelye, which I could nott perswade to goe before.

John Carter Whiddah, 22 Nov. 1686 I wrote you very lately by the Dutch sloope, which was out of sight ofland before my cano could gett on board him, [so] that 1had noe time to coppie the letter, but think the substance was the same I shall now confirme , being in answer to your last concerning the accommodating the Affrican Pinck with men slaves without bougees , which may be easily be accomplished in the same manner I before mentioned . Affter the major part of his Arda cargo is proposed in suitable goods, haveing not bougcs, put a convenient quant ity of sallab\e goods that will purchase gold as she is coming and comeing down, and the produce of those goods will accomplish good men slaves, haveing already discoursed the point here with the king and the whiteman, and the gold will be brought ashore with much less charge and loss then bouges by 4 or 5 slaves in the quantity ofbooges such a ship requires . lftbe Pinck should not come down this advise will be good for any other ship that comes from England, if they come with short quantityes of bouges as now they doe, they cannot doe amis in disposeing of any goods unless tJ1esemost proper goods I now shall mention: rangoes long cloths, bafts, currall, pintadoes broad, pautkeis. Any other goods they may venture to dispose of for gold, and the gold will doe bettertben the goods [omission?] quantity of goods and produce in gold. I have here in closed sent up my last years account , I cou ld not make it up at the halfe years end as accustomary by reason 1had not goods to baUance before that came in Captain Woodfine, and now you may see what was remayuing some months past and at Christmas. Un less a supply comes down I shall bee ashamed to make up the halfe years account. Since this account have put IO slaves aboard Walker 15 slaves aboard Brand.fill and several! other small parcelis, besides factorys expence and building. There.fore I intreat your Honour and the Gen[t] lemeo of the Councill will consider and send down a sufficient supply, for every ship comes short cargoed, and rake [?= take) what they can from me. I have some times 12, 14 or 20 white men a shore, all maLntained at the factory and out of my store. Pray amoungst goods for me send more scarlett and red perpetuanoes , but they are not proper in a ships cargo by reason the king is urueasendable [= unreasonalble) in the demands of such goods, and tis not the king nor Cabusbeers that buy them. I have been so extreamly abussed by the Company that I am almost ashamed to think how I have written to you but much more to them, 52 though I have just grounds to complayn by reason my reputation is abused and myself slighted and every thing quite contrary to what was promised me in England. I gave 1000£ security, and am allowed also double sallery, and that I shall not be trusted with balfe soe much value as my security amounts to is verry hard, besides halfe a thousand inconveniences and tenn times the hazard ofmy life as any where on the Coast. Wittnese loss of a great many goods, Comma nders and all our people, and although it bath pleased Almighty God to spare my life yett I have very often a privatt whisper in my ears that I am threatened to be destroyd, one time by poyson and anothe r time otheiwise, which makes me look about me and call all my wilts together and almighty God to protect me. One time I travell with a g[u)ard and wel I armed and another time with an antidote in my pockett, and alwaies discourse the point to the king and Cabushers, but they deny any such intention and seem to be verry true and loveing , God knows their hearts . I doubt not but by the providentiall hand of God to whether all. I thank God am pretty well in health at present, and now to oblige the king and Capusheers am building a small house at the kings town. 53 I shall[ = send) here inclosed a list of the dead and living. A proper Arda cargo is bougees; currall; rangoes; long cloths and sallempores; bafts; white pintados; allejars; pautkeis ; brass neptunes ; iron barrs; paper sletias, if good; any fine white luinen; beads, purple , white, lemon culler, green, all round and as bigg almost as a horse beane. [PS] Here inclosed also send the severall bills for the shipp[s] have been here since my last. There is the value of a bendy of gold I payed to Say and Ned, two of Captain Thomass Woodfines canomen, which J intreat you will to pay into your own hands for me. Here was an accident happened on a Cormanteen man named Quacco, an antiant inhabitant bere, who was murthered by a Mind [= Mine] man named Andaoma , who stabd the said Quacco severall times with a knife [so] that he dyed two or 3 bowers affter. The said mallafactor made his escape up to Poppo but was seiz'd there and brought down here. He confesed the ffact and said that another Mind man named Wooradoe sent him to Quacco to receive a debt, being tbe value ofa slave, and the said Wooradoo bid said Andaoma kill Quacco ifhe did not pay him, which be did, and was by the king and all the white men and all other the blacks here ajudg' d worthy of death. Accordingly his head was cut off in presence of Captain Poston, Mr Soomes, myself and several! others, also the Cabushers of the cuntrey . This attestation the freinds of Quacco desires me to write, by reason Quaccos brother now lives with the GeneralJ of the Mind , as they tell me. Also Griffin is related to him also. [PPS] I could not possible perswade the canomen to come up soon after the departure oftbe Sarah Bondaventure, nither indeed was it tben weather. You may be assured what ever the canomen say or pretend, I never did soe nor will hinder their goeing but alwaies contrary posted them away with what speede I can, for I could send every month if possible if it were a marke of gold a year out of my own pockett for the conveniency. [PPPS, in margin] Pray order all ships that comes down not to trade at any of the places between the River Volto and this place, for it doth but encourage a parcell of runaway rouges that harbour there at Kitto .54 They destroyed Captain Payne and 7 of his people and endeavourd the boat also,55 and at Popo they joined with the slaves on board the Charlton sloope and rum [= run] here ashore, killd tbe Commander and all they could and took all the gold and slaves. 56 l hear you have a great many doctors on this coast and that doctor Walber is there.

John Carter Whiddah, 6 Jan. 1686/7 ","There hath been no opportunity that I could find or make since I came here, but 1 have wrote to Cabo Corso, and I have always by gifts and promises and threats endeavoured to perswade or force the canoomen to retwàne speedily , and oflate in particular Say and them that came in Captain Thomas Woodfine, but by no means would they goe till the hermitan. Now whatever excuse they or any other make or say to the contrary are lyes, and Tdesire you to believe the certain truth . When Say with the rest of the canoomen that went last up departed from hence , I made them promise and swear that they would not stay above 2 or 3 days at Popo , but notwithstanding they stayed above 3 weekes, and alJ tbe reason I could hear was because one Mind canooman that was amongst them would not goe any sooner and then when he did goe it was to serve the Dutch, for the Dutch Chiefe at Offrah paniard a man that stole their flagg and sent him up to Popo to goe for the Mine 59 and the whitemen finding no Minde canoe there forced our canoomen to take him in and carry him to their General!, which they readily obeyed without order or knowledge from me, and I believe the fear of displeasing the Generali of the Mine made them post away with the Negroe , so soon as they tooke him in. They said they had no room for any Negroes here by reason they had 4 shipp canoomen to goe up in their two canoes . All which I leave to your examination why the Cabo Corso canoomen hould stand in fear of the Dutch and be always governed by the Mine canoomcn. If there be but one Mine canooman amongst 11 or 15 I have always observed that he shall govern the rest. Captain Nanter arrived here the 26 December and hath 230 slaves on board from hence, and all the rest are in the Factory with 40 more if occasion served. His cargoe falls short and the more short by reason 6 barrels of his booges proved bigg, whereby was 6 slaves and more lost I tbinke. To help him a little what slaves he bas are very good and about 4 men to one woman , which will be welcome at Barbados. 60 God send him well there and his Negroes in as good plight as they goe aboard, and I am sure they are worth 21 £ sterling per head round , I am so confident in the goodne se. In my letters by canoes and by the George Sloope have requested some goods down, ffor I shall be ashamed to make up this last halfe years account. Per the canoes did send up a 12 months account , since which is now halfe a years expcnce charge and 40 slaves , and now more put on board the shipp here, and I suppose it will sound best in England that this Factory, where more slaves is shipt of then ffrom any one place in the world, 61 should be maintained by the Royall Company, it being theirs; ffor now am sure l have but a bare ffactory, and I thinke it great pity it should be so empty, for I believe tis the largest factory of accommodation both for the Companys servants and slaves on the Coast of Guyney, I mean of a house,62 and withal more convenient and secure. I can entertaine 5 or 6 ships cargoes, 6 or 800 slaves &ca, and secure all from thieves and fire in all probability, and the Factory is at the same expence as if all the shipps were consigned to the Factory. You write to know how Captain Walke r went away, and I answer very well from hence , and I put two slaves aboard him for the Companys account. I hope he may be well arrived in Jamaica afore this. Likewise the goods I received safely by Captain Thomas Woodfine, and I request the favour you will not charge me with neglect when tis as impossible for me to doe more than I have done in that particular, I mean oftener sending advise, as tis for me to traveU to England by land from this place, unless you can order the canoomen att a better rate or had not cutt the !eggs the Company gave me when I came out.63 My grief is sufficient, there needs no aggravation, and thank God for a good heart.

I have [sent] up for the letter by reason one of Captain Nanters bills of loading is [blank]. Sometimes the canomen will not go till such a time, and sometimes they will goe from hence and stay a month or two at Poppo, which is a great vexation to me and have been ever since I came here , and your letters have been like Jobs comfo1ters. I give you this relation that you may not think any negligence in mee . It was debated in England by the Company whether I, as being then ordered Cheife for this place, should have a dependance from Cabo Corso Castle or not , and twas conc luded l shou ld. The reasons given me, that in case of want of any supply I could have spedier recours to Cabo Corso than to England, both by the advice boat was sent with me and the often returning of canoes, wh ich was sattisfactory reason. But now I perceive I sbalJ have no supp l yes, not such as may maintain Factory expence. Where the fault lyeth , I know not I am sure tis not in me. If the Company hath given orders to the contrary, tis but just Tshould know of it. For all the loss of Iives, for a II the unnecessessary ex pence, if any, tis occasiond by the Company, for I did not move the Company to come here, only to spend their mony; but it was otherwise proposed to me, and for that reason the Company required a double security of a private Factor, and allowed me double the sallery, with a promis of advance. lam at the same expence , as if all the ships were consigned to my selfe, except the brandy for expending in buying of slaves, and that often lyeth parte upon mee too . Gentl emen , by the i.nclosed account you may perceive what quantity of goods remayn in the Factory, and that I have just cause to complayne; and if you will not please to send me no more I will doe my best endeavour to maintain the honour of the Royall Companys Factory here with what goods I have ofmy one[= own] and other peop les in my hands till I depart hence, which I hope in God may not be long, my three years being past considerable. 68 I will ask only God almighty's blessing for a fair opertunity and his good providence to protect me safe from th.is fataU and unfortunat e place of Ardra. Now Captain Briston [= Bristow] is an-ived but himselfe and Doctor very ill, but hope they may recover. They came ashore iU and went directly up to the IGngs Town, and lay one night, but was ill very bad, after that they went both on board againe. I perceive by the strangness of Coom1anders two of the las test when they first came here, that rhave some straog( e] i 11report spread of me, 69 which hath caused me to make a Little inquie1y, and I am informed that Say sho11ld tell some of the Counc ill of Cabo Corso goeing up to the Mine or at sometime that Captain Thomas Woodfinc and I bad a falling out and that he went sick aboard; such a thing might have been and I not to blame , but on the contrary we had no faUing out as I remember , and he went ve1y well on board and was so two dayes , if not more , before he sickened, and truely till the day he dyed I did not think him otherwise sick than with vexing at thee miscarridges of the cano kickatevoing 70 almost eve ry day, and drownding several! slaves, for we were told that every morning he stood on tbe quarter deck with his prospective[ = perspective] glass freeting and vex ing himselfe that the slaves could not be gott on board, for if it had pleased God the sea would have pennitted he had had all hi slaves on board and reddy to sayle by the time he first fell sick. 1 told him at his comeing fust ashore that if please God weather permitted he should have his slaves in 10 or 12 dayes at farthest. He was but one or two nights ashore in all and he was so much my frei.nd that he had been 200 if occasion had required . His welfare and hea lth was so esteemed by me that I would have hazard my health and life to have preserved bis. Gentlemen, beleive me to be so much a Christian that I abhor tbe thoughts of doeing or suffering any injury to be done by to my freind. It is more then I would have done to the worst enimy I have. If any such words have been utterd l beleive my man Unguah, who is kindred to Say, hath been the occasion , by reason I will not have him come down againe , hath wrought this forregery. I doe beleive formerly when our house was green, being now [= new] built, it might be a little unwbolsome, but now as it is I am confident tis as wholesome as any house in the cuntrey , and as convenient and as moderate drinking. Captain Walker went well away Captain Branfill, the same Captain Poston the same Captain Somes the same Captain Hobs tbe same Mr Hereford the same Captain Nanter the same Captain Gilbert the same Captain Hosea the same Captain Crookshanks the same Captain Daile I suppose never well.71 These went all well away, God be praysed, and lay all their time at our house, except Crookshanks lay 2 nights at the Kings towne. I cannot gain say or argue against the providence of almighty God, but thank God my contience is clear from willfuJI ingury to any man in the world, and as Agent Bradly use to say if any man wishes or endeavours any injury to any man liveing, may the same misfortune happen to himselfe. [PS] I am troubled 1 am continually constrained to write such epistles not tending to business. Here inclosed comes my last account to Christmas last, and if! have no more goods shall be trobled to write no more accouts, so shall be eased of that troble . AJso comes here 3 bills of loading from Captain Gilbert , Captain Hosea and Captain Crooskshanks . I have all along furnished the canomen with brandy and tobacco and palm oyle, and most commonly cables and anchors, and never bad one returned againe. That graplin you sent by Captain Thomas Woodfine , Mr Attwell 72 wrote me word he sent it by Say and one for themselves to, but they keept both. These canomen now l furnish with brandy, tobacco, palm oyle, wood and some other little necessaryes, as stockfish, beef, pease &ca. If you send the said Say of[ = off] a slave you will doe a Christian act and justice to the deceased Captain Woodfine , for his canoman were all strangers here but Say, and Captain Woodfines whole dependa nce was on bis abillity and care, but after Captain Woodfine went on board he [ = Say] neve r would stirr off in the cano but stand ashore and se the cano kickativoo, and when Mr Attwell, who was there for he went alwaies to the waterside, saw the miscarr idgcs and scolded at Say for not goeing off, Say laughed at him. Then Attwell told me and I threttened him and designed to have fully acquainted Thomas Woodfine and likewise write to you, but he took little notice off itt. He is so great a rouge that if you doe not send him off, I will ifhe comes here while I am here. I have strove much to perswade these cano men to goe off hence and now I se their store of flower all is not above a sheet chest full, which they have cheaper at Popo by about l. [lbs] bouges or 2 lb at most, and that they should goe and go there a month to save that is strange to me. It trobles me that you should have so Little Christianity as to think me guilty of the least thought of such villaney. I never gott but one ring, that was at one Commanders buriall, I think my namesake, but have lost, I think, by all, especially by Thomas Woodfine . Had he lived it had been 20£ short in my way, but lam not so mersenary as to vallue that equall to the life and enjoyment of my freind which was honest Thomas Woodfine , whose death I now lament and all that have dyed at this place. I conclude with this scripture phraise, the Lord doe so and more to one [= me] ifl have done or know of any such injury done to any person since I came to Whiddah, neither doe I beleive any such thing have been done unless twere to Doctor Gates, Edward Hill and my selfe when we were at warrs with these peop le.73 [PPS) March the 23d 1686/7.

10_Whydah_Law_Vol_II_p322_347.txt,"825. John Carter Wbiddah, 10 May 1687 ","Since my last to you by Occammy 74 I have been at Litle Poppo, and the towne where the canoos used to depart from is called Attome, being a few houses (or rather beehives only larger) standing on the sand by the sea side.75 There I saw Annomab the canooman, which gave me my letters aga ine which I have now sent. At this towne of Attome I with Mounsieur Couerden the French Chiefe , 76 who went with me, were received by Mounsieur John Poeselwitt, ffactor for the Branderburgh, 77 who hath dispatcbt two of their shipps from thence but wi ll no more I suppose. Mr Poeselwitt in respect to us put up his flagg, intending to make us as welcome as he could, and that day we went to see Offerry Grandy, the kjng of Accraa , who recides about halfe a myle ffrom thence, 78 and whyle we were there the blacks at the said towne tooke down Mr Poeselwitts fflagg and put up a Dutch fflagg, at which affront to our ffriend we returned immediately from the town and pulled down the Dutch fflagg, intending the Branderburgs ffiagg up againe, but soon after another Dutch fflagg was up, noe Dutch men ever reciding there, onely by now perceive them all Mine people , or at least the rulers. 79 Whi le we were arguing the reason with the Captain of the towne, Dutch fflaggs were put up at severall houses to the number of six. We had no pretence to the place, but immediately tooke our things and departed with our canoes to Offeryes, the king, and I lay their that night. The next day went to Sofferyes or Offery Occammyes , that is about 2 or 3 myles more windward, we generally call him Sofferry Pickaninnee, who is the Generali of the Accraes and lives in much more &,>Tandeiur than the king, having all ways a good strength of soJdjers at his command, and the river comes up to his croom, having 5 times the houses thatt is att the towne of Attome, and lives in the midway betweene the sea and the river, and the sea is about a quarter of a myle .80 He proffered me, ifl would send the canoes to take their departure at hjs place , he will hall over the canoes to the sea and furnish them with all necessaryes for their voyage and always speed them away. He is a person much afore the king for wisdome, valour &ca, very solid and very honest by all report. I thought him a :fittperson to secure, and have now sent a canoe to fetch him down to take a fetish to serve the Royall Company only, and shall give him a Companyes fflagg and a letter to any of the Companyes ships that shall have an occasion to stop there, and they shall apply thems.elves to him and not to the Mine people. They always abuse the English, twas these Attome people that got all the Charletoon sloops gold, or else we had gott some of that againe. 81 lf l can secure this Saffery Pickaninny , be is more than all the peop le of those parts and can do as he pleases. He shews a respect to the king of Accraa, but the king is nothing without him and they are as brothers. 82 The rest J leave the canoomen to informe. Just after l bad wrote this I was told tbat the Generali of the Mine had sent the said Soffery Pickaninnee a letter about 3 weeks afore, and that the letter was sent by Soffery to the Chief at Offrah , who invited Soffery down to him, 83 the truth of which I have now sent up my boy Cuffee to know, and whether he will be tme to our Company. Ifsoe I will ingagc him as firm as I can, for we stand in need of him (I now perceive) on the account of our canoomen, ffor if the Dutch gett him, there is no passage out of the river but by this man and the Attome people; and the pride and insolency of the Dutcb is not pleasant and the Mine blacks take after the Dutch , they have all along stopped our canoes and our canoomen will nott or dare not complaine . I herewith send 5 bills of lading of the last shipps that went away, all having quick dispatch some 14 days , 15 and the longest 20 days. The succeeding Comander of the Lucitania 84 notwithstanding I furnished him with a canoe to slave him, by reason bis canoe was too long and not so ready to goe of here, at his going away sold his canoe to the interloper without speaking the least word to me of selling itt. When I heard of it I told him twas unkind not to offer me the refusall , since I had lent him a canoe to slave his shipp gratis, so at last he sold her to me, and now the canoomen having no canoo fitting to carry them up I lent them this 9 hand canoe to carry them up, and request your honour will please to order her downe againe by the I st conveyance, she being mighty convenient for the river here . Quavoo hath promised me to take care of her but I cannot depend on that. Here is few canoomen here and no canoes to depend upon. We have now no goods in the Factory of the Companyes , however I will not be wanting to dis[c]harge my duty to them . If it be possible that the canooman Say hath spoken words to that high degree of mischiefe , I request so much Christian justice (if heathenism doth not predominate at Caho Corso Castle above Christianity , for ought I can bear great creditt is given to the single report or whisper of a heathen rascall) I request the àaid Say may be punished according to his desarts and sent off or down here . The villany is to hard for me to bear, that such report shall be forged and I cannot come to give better satisfaction . How many times have I requested a vessel down here to come up and cannot be granted , and I will not be a boy to come up in a canoe. God bless all people from such hard fate .

Captain Hobs and Captain Nanter being both very heavy dull sailors, had long and tedious passage, and which was worse, both ships happen 'd to be much vissit'd with the small pox, which with the fflux, the usual! distemper of a long voyage, carrid of nigh ninty of the Negroes per Captain Hobs, and nigh half of those of Captain N anter. 3 The few that were left in both ships were most of them in low condition, so yeilded but a low price. Those per Captain Hobbs, by you stild good Gold Coast Negroes, we here found not to be so, but of severall nations and languages, as Alampo , the worst of Negroes, Papas and some of unknown parts, and few right Gold Coast Negroes amongst them, which are here presently now discern'd by every planter or inhabitant of this island from any other sort of Negroes. 4 The generallity of people here haveing of late years sufficiently paid for such their knowledge are no longer to be deceiv'd theirin. We also observe you send some old Negroes , gray headed, and some very small chilldren , nither of which will here scarce yeild the freight to be pai.d for or what their passage amounts to. It were better to lett you know, that the like may be avoyd'd for the future. According to your desire we have here assist'd and furnished Captain Hobs with all nessessarys request'd for his return to you. The ship hath cost a great deal more mony and took up much longer time to reffit than could be immagind , amounts to 343£: 10s: lld sterling as per the inclosed account, which is £9: 4s for eight barrels of beeff which the ships company are to make good to you.

We have orderd the rum cask to be made less than those now sent on Captain Hobbs , and had you mention'd the size you would have them of they should have been so made. We could gett but two hogsheads of white sugar ready for Captain Hobbs , the other two hogshead are very goodMusco(vado] sugar, which we are told will sell well with you.

This serves cheifly to accompany the Affrican Marchant , Captain George Nanter Comander, who has spent much time and expended much mony in refitting his ship, the perticulars of all which you will find in his inclosed and account of his disburstments , of the justice of which you will be better able to judge then wee, especially in what relates to the seamens wages, and his expences and disburstments at Princes, of which we know nothing but as he informes us, and therefore could take noe other measures in furnishing him with monys but as he demanded it. We hope the ship will doe the Company considerable servis, and so answer the cost has been expended on her. What allowance the Captain is to have for the victualling his ship here we know not, not being privy to what contract you have made with him about it, and therefore must refer that also to your consideration, and adjustment. According to your desires we have shipt the sugar and rum you write for on the Company account, as appears per the inclos'd invoyce and bill of loading, all which we hope will come safe and in good condition to you, being excellen t good in their kinds and as well put in good caskes as is possible to be done, which we hope will encourage you to write to the Company to order considerable supplyes of mm to be sent you from this place, we being told per them that has had large experience of it, that it sells to the natives as redily and for as much as brandy , which if it doe must be of great proffitto the Company to make use ofit rather then brandy, since it cost not much above a third part of what brandy stands them. 5 ln all the convenience we shall have by it, is to advance the Company intrest, and to help make returns to them, it being now very difficult to make large and good returns, from hence to England. 6 Yours of the twentieth of Ffebruary per the Orangtree, and of the ffirst of March per the Mary are now with us, those two ships arriveing here the twenty ninth past , haveing had great mortallity among their negroes, each ship haveing lost about one hundred of what they took in. The rest have had the flux and are in very poor and mean condition, the small pox also being very much on board the Mary, which will binder their sales, and we fear make them come out at very low rates, ifwe can sell them at all, this island haveing for eighteen months last past paid very dear for pocky Negroes, import'd here by an interloper, in the loss of many thousand slaves, besides abundance of our white people, to the great weakening and impoverish of our island, soe that we are in great streight what we shall doe with the Marys Negroes, and indeed them per the Orangetree are so poor and bad that nobody rares [ sic: =dares?] to goe on board to buy any. We therefore earnestly recomend it to you for the future , as one of the greatest services can be done the Company, that you will send us as many good Gold Coast and Cormanteen Negroes 7 as possible can be gott, those comeing alwaies in good condition , also well accepted here, but we pray you by noe means to send Allampoes , for they are so bad and so well known here that, let them come in what condition they will, they will scarce sell at any price. Wee observe what you write concerning Mr Bayly and Mr Standleys imbeazleing goods on board the prizes taken per Captain Bridges, and would be glad we could return any thing from them for the Company, but Bayly is dead , and Standly utterly denies that ever it was in his power to imbezle anything , for that he was never imployd but in one ship, that bad noe goods on board but a little iron and red wood, which he deliverd at Cabo Corso as he receiv'd it, and dares averr that Agent Nurse nor any of the Councill ever chargd him with any such misdemeanor, and seams to be much surpris'd to meet with this account and carrecter ofhimselfe here. We have not further to add but referr matters of news to Mr Elwaies , who is an intelligent man and to whome we have given liberty to take on board such reffreshments ofwynes and other things as Agent Nurse orderd him to procure for him, and we have also permitted some tokens to be put on board the ship, which some people have sent to their relations on the Coast for refreshment, which are not much, besides what are sent to Mr Carter 8 for houshold stuff, house keeping and refreshment.

Your not giving me any encouragement to returne Captain Nanter to you, and the Company thinking the last repairing of her was very costly, though the greatest part of the money was for seamens wages, which must have been paid if she had not been sent to you, I shall therefore follow their orders about that shipp, in disposing of her here the best I can, for I find she will cost more money to fitt her for another Guinea voyage than did last time, and though the Coast Friggatt has cost now in repayres about one hundred and fifty pounds, besides other insidents and wages due, amounting to in the whole three hundred, twenty and four pounds , ten shilling and six pence, halfpenny, as per the inclosed accompt appears, yet I hope, God sending her safe to you, her service will pay her charge with good proffitt to the Company. By her I send you invoyce and bi II of loading for fifty two puncheons , twelve hogsheads and twenty four tierces of rumrn, and though it exceeds what you writt for in quantity, yet considering the freight cost nothing, and that every one that comes thence assures me it is a very proffitable comodity for the Company on all the Coast, and being now very good, and at a moderate price, though growing very deare, I was willing to take this oppertunuty of shewing my diligence and care in the Companyes service, and I hope they and you will account it so in this particular. Captain Wood carried himself very well in this voyage, and I hope at his returne to you, will deserve the continuance of your favour to him, and if you see no objection against him, I conceive if you retume the the shipp with slaves he may be fitly trusted with that charge, if you find any error in his accompts, as to seamens wages or otherw ise, you will be better able rectifie it, by your books, than I cou.ld here, though I hope there is no error in it, though I have by me the papers you sent me thereto relating.

Yesterday my drummer run away to Com1antin, being indebted two hundred gilders att home and aboard ship, occasioned by that the General off the Mine was pleased to invite him to the Companyes service, as your worship will see by the inclosed coppie off the letter writen by the Generali of the Mine to the foresaid dnimmer. Today I have written a letter to Mr Jo'el[?] Smith at Cormantin, 18 who sayes that tomorrow I shall have ane answer, according to which I intend to take my measures. I remain infinitly thankfull to your worship for all kyndnesses, hoping to find a tyme wherein I can recompente them . In the mean tyme I wish your worship all desired happiness ",,2,994

The same day wee received advice from our Comess at Succondee , whoe confirmes the same that the two Succondee canomen reported upon the 13/23. In all this doubt tis my oppinion that the same little ship which Mynheer Verdyke said was English Companys ship, is the same little pyrate which took away the negroes from Succondee and Axim , soe much the more, because upon the 25th instant shee went from Succondee, and past by Commenda and this place, almost out of sight in the sea, and likewise yesterday in the evening our people of. Cormanteen se a ship passing by at sea, which by appearance is the same shipp. If in case your worship hath any shipp which is called the St John, whereof the Captains name is John Rocet, then will my supposition be false, and that which is written by our Comess Mynheer Verdyke true, which I humbly desire your worship will be pleased to lett mee know, for my further information. I knew no better but that your worship was informed of every thing thus farr , especially because your worships ship departed yesterday night for Comenda. ",1687-05-17 00:00:00.000000,2,995

Agreement was eventually reached in 1688, whereby the English renounced their claim to Christiansborg but kept Frederixborg. 26 It may be noted that at least two other letters were received in this period from the Danish Director-Genera l, perhaps on the same subject, which are alluded to in the Rawlinson conespond ence, but were not copied into the Cape Coast letter-books. 27 ",,2,996

Taccabas brothertos did owe him omething, but how much hee could not tell me, for that Mr Edwards on his comeing from Cabo Corsoe tooke the paper from him, and imployed Mr Rives therein. As to the former the Copeman of Butteroe hath panyard him for mee, whose money when I receive shall give you an accompt off, and for the two boys Kinney and Benney released by Mr Pilkington Captain Dickie (as himselfe and the Cabbosheers doe testify) did pay oz2 4a to ditto Pilkington for their re)ea ement. Dickie also promises that that if he cannott gett the boy Will, which run away, to Succondee himselfe by fair meanes, he will paniar some of Occady people on his heade and bring lbem to mee for satisfaction. Hee hath importuned mee for a cane which Mr Pilkington promised you would send him. Alsoe the rest of the Cabbosheers doe expect dasshees for Christmas, wherefore I desire you wil1please to lett me know what customes or dashees these people are allowed, that I may governe myselfe accordingly. Per the Briganteene bee pleased to supply mee with some Guinea cloat(b]s and with powder on accompt of the Royall African Company. If ships arrive l desire to know whether I shall send downe the packett or not. In my last I committed an error in forgetting to send money for Mr Pilkingtons case, which J had taken to myselfe, and did disigne then to bee accomptable for itt. As for pewter I thought it bad been putt in the canoe, but have since is noe more then one small dish, 3 old plates, l tankard and spoone remaining,understood that his boy Jack carried away two plates and a spoon, soe that there which being worth little, Mr Pilkington had them into the bargaine of other things bee bought of Mr Edward[s], wherefore for them and the case have sent inclosed Sa, being what they are worth. As for what goods you doe not finde disposed in bis books, I cannot discover anything of them, wherefore with many thanks for your late favors, I shall conclude. Dickies Cove, 25 Jan. 1693/4 ",,3,36

Capt. Richard Bradshaw in the Swallow Briganteene arrived here last night. In your last letter I am ordered to cult a great quantity of timber, which by reason of our carpenters lameness, who hath not been able to stand upon his leggs these IOdayes, as also two more of our slaves, I cannott effect, nevertheless shall send what I can gett ready, and I must needs say Mr Pilkington was very much overseen 108 in chuseing out of 35 slaves which were here such sorry ones for to continue at this factory, two of them being boys and one old fellow of little or noe service, whereas considering the work wee have in hand to finish the fort, as also that of cutting tymber, wee ought to have able slaves, as also a greater number, with more workmen, otherwise I fear wee shall not finish our work before the raines, the floors of all our roomes being yett unlaid, our walls not pointed, our curtaine walls and ports upon our battlements not raised, as also them not tarrased, our hall not covered other then with thatch, besides a small tower (which it will be necessary for us to have) not built, as also several! doors and windows to make, all which shall referr to your consideration what tyme our carpenter and bricklayer with 3 or 4 slaves will bee a finishing, for which wee shall want a great quantity of deels [=deals], with nails, with hinges both for doors and windows; therefore if upon arrival! of the shipps you please to order them to put on shore such d[e]ales and other things as wee want, as also if you would please to spare us the surveyor for two or 3 weeks, with more slaves and workmen, it would mightily forward us, for indeed if the slaves which Mr Pilkington sent downe were here, they would not want irnployment.

Our slaves being few in number, and them none the best, have had work enough, notwithstanding the assistance they have had from the Townes people, in bringing on shore the goods, shells and bricks abovementioned, and it is more then they can doe to bring wood and water to the Fort for our owne use, wood to bume our lyme with, water for mixing it, beside s working it with swish, 109 and makeing it fitt for use, alsoe a great deale of other worke, which they are every day about, wherefore unless you will please to send 6 lusty slaves more to abide here, I can make but very little progress towards finishing our Fort, much more be able to cutt the tymber & wood you expect, for I must needs say there is now almost as much occasion for the slaves you sent for from hence as ever, the country people beeing a rowsawing, 110 and therefore not able to give us that encouragement, it being a great while since they have had anything given them more than a little liquor, which they doe not vallue, wherefore I desire you will please to furnish mee with a piece of red or blew [=blue] cloth that I may give to such as I finde dcserveing and promoters of the Royall Companyes interest.

I beleive if and procured whatyou sent encouragement to Jappo, Ashrevys enemy,150 people you can to joine with him, you might soon have an army to retake Succondee and severely revenge the murther of Mr Johnson, which if you doe not doe and that Blacks perceive you soe little vallue the lives of your Factors, in a short time more it will grow to a common practice and yourselves may not be altogether free. You will never advantage the Company by not punishing the murthercrs of their servants, but day by day you will find their interest decrease thereby. The warrs between the Dankeraes and Awomweyes [continue?], 151 and indeed soe much that some of the former have been downe att Butteroe, one of which came hither and bought what perpetuanoes I had remaining, and told me from the others that there were a great many traders come downe to lmpoho country,' 52 which upon their second returne should be to Dickies Cove, and [would have] been then but for want of (a] way to be cutt through the bushes leading hither, which our Cabbosheers have promised Logoe about on this side if they will doe the like on the other.

Thoma s Buckerid ge Yours of the 13th instant with the necessaries at the foot thereof have received, also 10 new muskitts (5 old ones being wholly unserviceable are herewith returned), and what last wrote for, 12 slitt dales, 4 small gimblett s, with threed and needles more for the surveyor, 1000 ten peny oailes, 3 plaines and plaine irons, a fore plaine, a jack plaine, a joynt er, a broad axe, a gudge [=gouge) and a firmer.230 The ladles you sent are to large for our gunns, and for the fuses (our Gunner not knowing how to fitt and fix them) am little the better. l shall endeavour to put of the damnified goods, to what advantage am able, & must desire you to putt a small price upon the sayes, which otherwise, being no commodity in this countrey, will lie untill they are worth nothing. I believe att 12a each may in a short time dispose of them. The chest of beads can also sell but not att six taccoes per pound, wherefore if you will suffer me to vend at a lesser rate I doubt not to make a considerable sayle thereof. What I wrote in my last concerning the fort was what I experienced when here before, and have great cause still to feare, the walls which tumbled being built of the same or little better stuff. The surveyor according to my judgement hath done and daily uses his endeavour , which without materialls can but little availe. Both he and I hope they will not fall againe, and keep our slaves continually att work in getting shell between this and Butteroe, from whence think wee may procure 40 or 50 butts, which shall be sure (to) use to what advantage wee can. I am told their are great quantity of shells about 6 leagues to leward which may more then finish our work and that Mr Pinck hath payed for them, but unle s I have a great canoe and halfe a dozen small ones for bringing them hither, shaJJ reap little benefitt of them, the people here being unwilling to goe without extrodina1y payment, and then but when they please, not halfe loading their canoes, but if you please to send me such from Cabo Corso or allow me to purchase the latter here for Companys accompt , I have canoe men belonging to me to padle them, who shall wholly imploy in fetching thereof, whereby doubt not in a little time and without much charge to procure lime enough for our building , if some new pallavar of the negroes does not interveen. The timber for the cook roome, 4 planckes for gunn carridges and peices for axle trees, lyes ready for sending. Captain Dickie and Cabbasheers demand their Chistmas dashees according to contract made with me formerly, which Mr Pinck hath not payed. The former desireth his cloth to be blue, which if you please to send me one or two more for such Cabbesseers as may be servisable it will not be amiss. What the Cabbasheers are to have at Christmas and at their dancing time in June, be pleased to advi e. The coppy of their contract being not with mee, have forgott. Here are abundance of Dankra traders continually baiteing me for goods, who would not lett me rest until[ I promised to write for some, which if they come safe, could heartily wish were supplyed with, as well to defray factory charges as to sati fie the tradder , from whom have bought four cows, which if you please to have shall send downe by first opportunjty. I believe this will prove a place of gr at trade and in some time will fully repay the Companys charg[e) of building with interest, if new warrs do not brake forth. I here the Taggees have fought, upon which have various reports, wherefore hope it may be for the Companeys interest.231 I lost in comeing Mr Mellross note of debts,232 which desire to have a coppy of per next, also some flints, haveing none that are good in the fort , with corkers [=caulkers] tools for the surveyor. Asherrey hath lately been at Succond e panyaring his brother Mensa's women, and i now within two miles of us at a Cabbasheers croome named Conconoco with some force, pretending he is going to Axhim. I have bought some snappans [= snaphances], which designe to keep in the fort for use thereof, that if any disturbance should happen the Companys blacks and others belonging to mee may be armed for our defence, the rnuskitts l have not being sufficient for halfe our people neither so ready as the former, wherefore desire they may be allowed in my first accomp t. PS.Jam in great want of a small vise[= vice]233 for cleaning our arms. Please to send some swords and bandileers.

The Cabbasheers here want to goe for Cabo Corso againe, seeing they have no pallaver to make.236 Wee have burnt one kiln of lime, and thatchl the hall, and now most of the slaves must stand still, they not being suffered to goe into the woods, which with the continuaU raines wee have and have had (ere[= ever] since the surveyor arrived) shall proceed very slowly toward repaireing the Fo11.

The daminner 241 his wife and a lusty young man are pawne for the powder and bans 242 that I trusted the Addoomes, the five which I took for the perpetuanoe are Atoo, Coffe, the man that is sick, the boy that has a gold feitich about his neck, and the tall young man. The other a little boy I kept for better satisfaction of the other five. I humbly de ire the 3 pawnes of Dickies to be returned me when the shipp comes, except Dickie will send the money, which is 4oz 4a 6ta, Mr Pinson can satisfie you which,243 and the fiv[e] pawned for the perpetuanoe . Two of our townes people are panyard in the bu hes and will not be delivered till the pallaver is made up.

I have a very hard welling in my belly and stopage in my tomach, that I cannot fetch my breath without great paine, which makes almost incapable of any bussiness. Just now King Badue sent to me to know your answer, and also was very urgent for the souldiers money, saying he had given pawnes for it. I presume if the money was paid would be a great insight to me, to ee their reallity of performing their promise , and should know how far they de erve more. ",,3,108

According to your orders thought fitt to tru t none. Seeing he could not be keept off us, according to your comm.ands I gave him orders to retire, which they tooke no notice on. According to your orders that I am to trust none, thought fitt in defence of myself to fire at him, to keep him off by fireing at him. They came into the towne where our people formerly lived and sett itt on fire. Wee then soone engaged them. with all our force , notwithstanding their attempts were soe bold to sett our slaves houses, come houses &ca on fire about us, which much endangered the Fort, in soe much that there was not a window about us but were filled with shott, they being soe lowe, wee haveing but seven men, three of them being wounded at the first engagement, we had then little assistance. I have Jost abundance of my owne people, two of the Companyes slaves wounded, I doe not know whether they be dead or noe, being in haste, neither can I in reallity say whether I can at this maintaine the Fort or no, but there shall be nothing wanting in me. People that were with me in my roome and warehouse were wounded, shotts comeing thro both. I was forced to come to a parley, most of my people being wounded and the rest out of heart. Soone after came the Dutchman my neighbour , who soon after came here, nothing discommended the blowing of the flagg and the couradge of the people, saying they had the flagg by orders. Sirs, I allways advised you that he was an enimy Lo us and [there was] noe trusting of him. Take what the present offers, being in great danger att this time. I had the luck to have Mr Barter , who has behaved himself very valliantly, who after John Pinck was wounded was everywhere his presence was necessary. Our granadoe shells, which wee soe much wanted, were not worth that name, scarce three of them being filled. I have lost all my sheep, goats & provisions, and I have nothing left wherewith to keep me & my men, but must starve without your immediate supply.

I went ashore, they sent for Ringoo, King of the Doomes.96 The Cabbosheers was earnest to have the flagg hoysted, which I did as soone as possible. The Dutch Coapman sent his cane to me three times before l had done. The fourth time he sent to demand of me the reason I did not come to him, he sending so often, for all palavers must be made in his Castle. Then I sent to tell him I was about my masters business, but by and by should be at leasure, and would meet him anywhere out of his Castle, so wee mett betweene the Castles. He asked me if your Worshipps had told the Generali of the Mina that you would settle againe at this place. I told him that was not my business to enquire affter. He said he thought the Dutch and English was friends. Yes, said 1,and it may be best to keepe soe, and with a few words wee parted, but understand he is displeased and doe write to the Mine this night. About four this affternoone, the King came hither with a great guard. He came to me and then went to the Dutch Castle, but did not tarry above a quarter of an houre, then came to our side, where wee had a long palaver to that purpose, that he did promise your Worshipps that his people should help to build the Castle, which he will doe, and tarry here himselfe alwayes, if your Worshipps will please to goe about it presently, and send workmen and souldiers, and great gunns to defend the place, because he heard that some of the Anntar people did say, if any Englishman came to settle here, they would kill every man, but if your Worshipps will please to send men and gunns aforesaid, he would take care of all pallavers, that none should interupt the building, and say he love no roagues pallavers, if he did he would goe to the Dutch. He added that when the Dankeryes fought the Doomes, that some of em went to Cabo Corso for shelter, and the Admirall delivered him [= them] to their enemies,97 and if the English would doe so any more, I should tell him off it, for he did not love to be deceived, to which I told him be need not feare, but your Worshipps would be reall to him in all you promised, [and he said] that when be sent heads by his cozen to Cabo Corso when he fought the Antas and beat them,98 and Mr Ronan put him in irons, which he took very ill, and that he would have Adoe taken out of the ring [which] he understood by Addico he had on, and that he would not have Amuffoe, which killed Mr Johnson,99 come here any more, but desire your Worshipps would send him to Barbadoes, or to the Royall Company in England, and tell them that was the man that killed one of their Cheifs at Succondee. If your Worshipps cannot doe one of these, he cannot live with the English more. He desires your Worshipps will write to the Generall of the Mina, that you have taken possession of the fort at Succondee.

So soon as I was ashore I di patched a messenger to the King of Aquafoe to acquaint him of my arrivall, who ent downe his people to bid me welcome and verry earnestly requested workeman to goe on with the Forte, which he expected I had b[r]ought with me, and understanding to the contrary, said that if the Dutch had halfe the palaveras they would have had guns upon their fort ere this tyme, and that I hould dispatch a canoe purpo ely to acquaint you that he is verry earnest to have us fortifie our selves , that we may be in defence against all the friends of the Dutch. John Cabess and the rest of the Cabbosheers were verry earnest with me on the same account, and that they will assist you with stones or any thing they can, and as I understand by them they are doubtfull 39 of the Quiferas , the Dutch endeavouring to bring them downe to tume us out. I question not, if you can suply us with men and materialls, but before the rains to raise the fort of defence against any Negroes that shall asault us. If in very few days we have not workman the natives will be verry much disatisfied, and those that would be our f1iends may be forced to fay le us for fear of the Dulch. The timber for the lower floor I under tand you have ready framed, and for the upper floor I beleive here is almost uficeint here, which if this [is] raised would stop the mouthe of the Blacks, we could better fortifie our selfes, and I hope tomorrow night or a Munday morning you will send men and materialls, that we may not slip any opportunity, for all the people are verry much disatisfied that I did not bring workmen with me. I have sent a broken maul and desire three maulls , two crewes [=crows], two pick axe , for the breaking of tone. Alsoe I have sent a man slave which has been blind a Jong time, and I humble desire more slaves, Ju ty men for the breaking of tone, 38 T""I. and the free people will bring them [i.e. stones] to the fort, I supose for some small dashes , but as yet have made no [ms.

I desire a table, a cott and a great chest which is in the possession of Mr Salmon40 by first canoe, of which I stand in great need of, here being only row [ = raw] wans, the slaves haveing nothing to doe for want of mawles to break stone. John Cabess did as good as tell me yesterday that if did loose possession again it was our owne faulte, and that we _could never have the licke opportunjty. He says all the Blacks say it is he that has brought the Englisch hither, and it has cost him abundance of money and it will be a continuall charge to him till the fort is upp, the meantime he has noe place to fly to for protection , [and that the] Dutch are continua]y offering him dashes and lickewisse the same to Great Taggee to turn us out. The Dutch I under stand has a great trade and most of the people which live with them, could we protect them, would come and build under our fort. Here is not a lock to a dorre [ = door] or any else, I desire if you have any to send two, if not I desire the armorer may macke them. John Cabess is verry desireous to have some blew perpetuanoe s, and if you have any I desire you will send what you can, as alsoe some sheets (if you think convenient). John Cabess says he will live and dye with us, but he hath been in the Dutch fort since this falling out and I bebeve the Dutch will spare noe cost to gett him of their side, soe that we had best make use of the opportunity we have , for he tells me him se)fe they have offerd him whatever he demands to tum us out. I find by him he is not disatisfied at nothing more than at our being so backward to bouild , that we may be able to protect him, which with my respects humbly thanking for placeing me here. ",,3,286

I have cutt all.off in lenglh and squared six or seven load, and sunk a saw pitt and lined it out fitt for sawing, and gave direction s to the slaves to cutt it out in scantling,127 tilt lo be carried on board. I likewise told Capt. Piles what was best to be done with the timber and desired he would lett his carpenters mate or any one white man to see the slaves did what r ordered them aboul the timber , but he would not, and both the Captains 128 sware neither of their men should put a hand in order to getl dowoe the timber lo the sea side. Capt. Pepperell sayed he will carry but very little timber, and especially no heavy peices , he spoke of tarrying there two montbs. Capt Piles did intend to saile thence in eight or tenn dayes, but now he is vexed he must tarry for the other, and say none of his men shall help him. There is a great deale of as good timber as any upon the Coast, of two feet diamiter and downwards, but I doubt unless your worships send more slaves, and some white men to see the timber cut out according to orders, that the shipps will bring away but little, and there is enough cutt close to that which may be gott with little trouble. I have cutt the poles ordered by Capt. Piles. Capt. Pepperell desired me to acquaint your worshipps he expected a seven hand canoa, and if he have none cannot gett his wood on board his boat, for they ride at grapling 129 and cannot gett away att the Brandenburgh Castle. The slaves have no come, nor is there any to be bought in the countrey, else I had bought them some, for they cannot work without it. I came from thence a Fryday in the afternoon, it was late a Saterday night before I gott to Commenda, because of bad weather. Yesterday the raine hindred the canoa from goeing. Our masons have been to extravagant of their taITis in my absence, it is all gone and the tanck is not quite high enough to turne the arch, the bottom is not floored, therefore desire your worshipps would send downe three or four casks as soone as possible, that we may perfect it before the raines damage the walls too much.

He[= Quanza] has been very busie with the Arcany people who has been here some time since, butt they brought then noe money with them, for feare he should have taken it from them, upon which he gave them all assurances imaginable, that if at any time they came downe here to trade, they should not in any manner be molested in body or purse, by himselfe or any one else, the offender soe doeing should forfeit his head. Thereupon they exchanged fettishes together, and with such assureances they returned home in order to fetch downe money. He assures me there will be in a short time here a small trade, which God grant. Corne grows now scarce here, and I find by their mumbling they designe if they can to highten the price of itt. They will take now noe Companys perpetuanoes in baiter for it, pretending they are to deare, and the iron trade is now all over,27 soe if you give me not liberty to lett them have sheets, or what goods else I have by me in lieu of it, I am affraid shall not be able to purchase the 400 chests.

Afterwards gave you the need.fullin one to Mr Platt, but was then so strained for time with the p[a]lavers we had here that must beg your pardon for the rudeness, as also the tautologies therein, hopeing Mr Platt has been so favourable to me that after the perusal! lhe] commited it to the flames.19 l have now a little more leasure to compose myself, although yesterday had a very sharp plavers with the Kinge of Acroms and some of the Anguina Cabbosheers, who sent Quo to me to demand a hundred bendys, without which they said their people should not assist us, which did not a little startle me, to se their fair promises comes to these tennes, but finding the Queen was not among them [I) went imediaty to acquaint her therewith , who l found lying upon a matt and as she said indisposed (which the more rearuJy belived because she had been cupped that day). There was with her three of the prime Cabbosheers, to whome I had no sooner made known the cause of my coming, puting them in mind of their promises both to yourselves by their mesingers as al o to me in their many talks, telling them withall you had by reason they were so pressing to you to settle here taken of the people from other places where the inhabitants would give money for your protection , but they would not give me leave to proceed in what I had to say, the Cabboshers rising from their seats aid they were a hamed to hear any further, the Queen bad[e] me not molest my selfe, and that what she had promised should be pe1formed, whereupon she sent one of the Cabbosheers which were with her to ask the Anguinas by whose instigation he had sent so many messengers to Cabo Corso to fetch the whit men, and if they were not ashamed to comence such a plaver now. They would have huffled it off upon the Kinge of Acroome, but he denyed it a well as they, saying be never de ired any thing but a cloth, to which the Queen me senger made an wer it was not a time now to speake of that, but when the for wa up and gunn planted thereon, the which I ashured h.irn he need not doubt of, so that one plaver vanished. The Kinge of Acrome rising up gave me his hand that he would peak no more of it, telling me that it was gone wi[th] the wind, o which I replyed that such gusts were able to blow down forts, whereupon all was turned into a laughter, & he promi ed before all the Cabbo heers that his people should goe to work on Munday to dig the shell and gett them in a readyness, and that on Tuesday I should have them brought to the fort, beging withal[ a flask of rum to drink with them, the which I readyly consented to, but with this provi o, that they should have no more till such time they settled to worke, which was agreed on by all so that I hope all rubb 20 are over, and that our worke will goe on smoothly, for if we can but settle this I reckon the hardest of our worke is compleated. The shells lying at so vast a distance from us, being upwards of three miles, makes the people shun the worke as much as they can. The Queen pares no paines to forward the worke, and i.s therefore gone thi day to the oyster bank, with a resolution as she tells me not to return till she hath accomodated all things, which so oon as is effected and that they bring u shells [I] shall send a canoe with advice. They say it will be on Tuesday, but I have been so often deluded with fair promises that I know not how to trust them. As for wood and stone it lyes nearer to us, so that we shall not want workin[g] on the latter, of which we have a considerable quantity ready at hand and they are bringing day ly, but in a short time we must be forced to goe to the rocks to breack them, for which worke we have not one capable, wherefore the surveyor desires you will let him have Hary the Bomboy, with 5 or 6 slaves which ar at Dickes Cove, which said Harry knows are fitting for that work, that we may have som ready broken by such time these are worked up which we find up and down in heaps, so not to have any delay we are resolved to run up two flankers with all expedition to secure the footing we have, and the rather by reason the Queen informes me the Quamboes are gatheri ng men together, she hath sent out her spyes to hear news. The surveyor thinks it convenient (with your approbation), both for ornament as also for expedition, to turne the corners and make the windows and doors of brick, for the stone takes them up a great deaJe of time in picking them out and preparing them, wherefore if you like of it would have 50 or sixty thousand sent down with all expedition, for he begins tomorrow to lay the stones, and hopes by next Saterday night to have one flanker three foot above the foundation. He is likewise at a loss for somebody to temper his morter, being forced to put one of the white men to doe it, wherefore desire he may [have] a fellow which they call Guner sent who is at Cabo Corso. Here is a couple of black bricklayers come to offer their servis, one of them was at building of Annamaboe and they say is a good workman, it was them two built Captain Quansoes house.21 I have not as yet made any bargaine with them, refering them to the surveyor for his approbation and your order for their entertainment. We have lime enough for 5 or 6 dayes ready burnt, and if the Acrooms keep their words we shall be able to sett another small kilne on fire either Frid[a]y or Saterday, so that the bricklayers we have will give the more dispatch. I hope in 2 or 3 weeks time to have a flanker capable to bear guns, which makes me desire you will be pleased to order some in a readyness against that time, for it will be both an incouragment to the people here & also a terror to any one who hath a mind to oppose our building. We do not think to run it up to the top but to the first story, that it may be defencable. We shall be extreamly put to it for deal bords, haveing expended the eight Capt. Bradshaw put ashore for a dore, a table and a levell. The necessaryes I wrott for in my last desire you will send per first opportunity, as also 3 iron barrs to make cuntrey hatchets for the people to cutl wood for the burning our shells, some being more desireous of them then our axes here. Here is a smith can gett them made. PS, 11 Sept.

The reason the Queen is so pressing to have these things is because she must goe up to Anguina to adjust some matters between the Accims & her, whjch as am informed is concerning trade. She hath sent the Prince to tell the young men to come to worke, 28 which she leaves to him and her Braffo, to be imployed as I shall direct, & hath desired me to Jett Jack goe along with her,29 that he may hear what palavers she hath.

This news of Quamboe makes her very vigorous to forward the building. They sent to roe just now to intreat you to lett her have more bricklayers , she will see they shall not want stones nor shells. I wish yould spare us 10 more slaves for fetching water, for the country people will go but once a day. We shall want those slaves from Dicl<ies Cove , for if we go on as we have done shall quickly gett all the stones that are broaken to our worke, so that the Anguinas will have a pretence to be gone. They worke both night and day, when one Cabbosheers men leave off anothers begin. As for the bell I can bear nothing of it. Capt. Jefferyes saith he never sent any canoe thether, and neither he nor Quo knows anythinge of it so, that Mr Bloom must send some better directions. PS. Jack is sent up by our Queen and is able to give you a perfect accompt of all transactions here, as also whether the King of Quamboes man gives the same palaver to you as he did here.

Nicholas Buckeridge Wynnebah, 20 Oct. 1693 ","Meeting with soe convenient an opportunity thought fitt to lett you understand of our pr[oc]eedings, which altho' is not according as I could wish must trouble you with it, or being come almost to a full stop without your assistance, for the stones which Capt. Jefferyes & Quo advised you of, after haveing taken of the top, finde them to be soe small and such trash that the surveyor cannott make use of them for the outside of his work, so that we have been forced to pick up stones here and there where wee could finde them, which hath been a great hinderance to us, and wee haveing noe other remedy left but to go to the breakeing, the hardnesse of which and the few or noe hands wee have which understand the said worke makes it very tediou s, wherefore to give you the more expedition desire you would hasten down those stone breaker s which I formerly wrote for, as also the bricks, that wee may bee running up the Fort (I mean onely caseing it) till such tyme wee have stones broake to proceed with our curtaine walls, which I fear will take some tyme to effect by the progresse our slaves make, but indeede they are all novices, which makes mee hope when the old experienced slaves come wee shall make a better hand of it. You may assure yourselves wee will bee as saveing of the b1icks as possible, and if stone bee to bee had will not use a brick. I should have given you this advise sooner but that was in hopes to have found at the bottome of the heaps of stones fitting for our worke, and also rangeing the woods found that which they call the Old Castle, 35 where wee were advised should find vast quantitys, but after clearing of it was very much frustrated, there being nothing but a pittifuH waU of about 2. foote high and 2 thick, and this but on one side , the other being encompassed with a deep dry ditch, which you are very sensible could not afford us much stuffe. Wee have gott up two of our flankers and two of the curtaine walls almost to the first story, and the foundation layd quite round, soe that had wee had stone should have wanted the door cases , which at the foote of this hall have the dementions, that they may come down with the other necessarie , which the sooner you supply us with will bee the better for expedition. I have & will make itt my utmost endeavor to give you as little trnuble as possible, and should bee glad were I able to procure all things here, but when necessity requires hope you will excuse if wee continue breaking of tones. Wee cannott bee without a smith , for this hard stone make both crows and wedges un ervi able without they are new sharpened. I hope our palaver with the King of Quamboe may be near a period, for Captain Hansico and Amo had everything granted them by the Queen which you desired, and hath carried up one of her cozen to take fetiches. Wee hope may bee atysfactory. Shee gave a very fair palaver, and told the Kings man that when the Fort was up she would bee contented with what part of the ground rent his master shold allott her, hee being her uncle, 36 shee would put herselfe wholy into his hands, the which she desired him to acquaint him , but withall desired hee would hasten downe those supply of men which bee promised and that they might bee put into my hands.37 I fear they will bee a more trouble to us then assistance, by reason that in 5 or 6 day's after they come there victualls will be expended, and then if you would have them stay must find them come . The country people grumble very much that I have not dram to give them, in the roome whereof I am forced to give them palme wine . Wee had very bad sickness with our white men, all of them haveing had icknesse, and I feare shall loose evison, hee was taken the day before yesterday with a fever, yesterday was pritty well againe, but this night is taken speechle 'e. I wish you would send down some person to lett them blood, for they all linger extreamly, as also Capt Jeffryes, who is troubled with such a giddines e in his head cannott hardly stand . Mr Bloome sent his linguister hither about the bell , and with much adoe wee found out the person that brought it up, his name is Coffee Ariboy and lives at Lagoos.38 Quo knows the man, but John Le Grand 39 being present when was enquireing after it, told mee the canoe was oversett and the bell Jost, which if the man come hither shall not take as a ufficient answer. l asked John why hee had not told Capt. Jeffereyes of it before, his answer was hee thought the canoe men had done itt, but I finde they neither acquainted Quo nor Capt. Jeffryes with it. PS.

10_Winneba_Law_Volume_III_p427_504.txt,"1083. Nichola s Buckeridge Wynnebah , 12 April 1694 ","Yours of the 17th ultimo by the Briganteen have received , with the good & necessaryes therein mentioned, and ane addition of three guns, in such a condition [they] are almost unserviceable, [they] want both smiths & carpenters work, which I am ill provided to supply them , besides there is neither shott , powder nor any thing belonging to a gun, which makes me presume the press of business diverted them out of your memory, not having any advice of them in your letter. I was in expectation by said conveyance to have received some deal boards for scaffolding, haveing informed you soe largely of my wants, but I find you are not pleased to give any encouragement to the worke, otherwise you would not have suffered me to be here soe long without a board . Pardon me that l am thu plaine in expressing myself, but it is come now to that pu h that I cannot avoyd it, being forced to lett the worke stand still, and only provide [blank] shells and tone against such time you can supply me. On Saturday last I had like to have spoiled two of the Companys slaves through the weakness of our scaffolds, being for the most part say case board , with old rotten canoes , with which I have run the worke to that height , being now in the lowest place up to the fir t story, and all the back near six foot higher. So soon a deals come that I can cover any flanker , I shall bave sufficient lodging for my white men in them, and doe intend to reserve one for my goods, being timorous of having soe great concernes under a thatch cover, for which work must desire you to supply me with some bricks. The bomboy was much to blame to reckon 5000 more than he sent, which the surveyor & all the workemen can te tif:ie to be true, with which now l could [have] made shift for the present. If you could spare the surveyor and with him what carpenters you have to come downe & lay the beams and fix the joices , you might have them returned in a small time , and then we might cany up our worke regular, and besides would forward us very much, for in a small time wee hall worke as farr as we can goe till this be done , soe that the bricklayer mu t tand still and look on the carpenters . Be pleased to consider, at whatsoever time it is done, mu t have a carpenter or two from you , and hope it may suite with your conveniences to spare them now. Will is a very willing fellow, and when is well doth not grumble at his worke, but he must have somebody to direct him. He is now laid up with wormes, as also five or six slaves more. By the great canoe wherein went Capt. Jeffreyes went up Grande Quacou, he haveing been sick ever since I brought him downe. I had told Abraham he should goe up by the first opportunity, which made him put him in without further acquainting me, by which means I did not advise you sooner, which I hope you will excuse. If he is not in a condition to come downe I desire might have Tom in his roome, who I left behind, [he] being gone with Captain Hansicoe. His woman is here, who importunes me every day to write to you for him. I have had all the Anguina Cabbosheers downe here for these twenty days, which hath putt me to a great expence of liquor, all my rumme being expended, and what is more could not content them, their demand s being soe unreasonable. They brought downe with them three quarteirs of young men of between 30 or 40 each,65 which worked very well for 10 dayes, but when I came to press the Cabbosheers to hasten downe the next quarteires they told me they must see what I would doe, and before any of them should come downe they expected every one a cloth , which were upwards of twenty, telling me what I had already given was too little for all Anguina. I find if we have any assistance from them it will cost more than it is worth, neither can I give any thing with safety, having had large promises when I gave the last money that noe more should be demanded, now they pretend that was only to one division, which is 3 quarteirs. When they found I wou ld not comply with them they endeavoured what they could to persuade the Queen to goe up, but instead of prevailing with her she rise up in a passion, and told them if they had noe shame she had, and since she had sent & fetcht downe white men [she] would not leave the place till she had performed what promised, and sworne by her fathers head [she) would eate new come & yamrns here, and to show it was her intention hired the Winnebah to roasar for her, which they have done considerably, and with that left them, who imediately departed to their habitations in the country. What the event of this will be I know not. I have been with her since to know what we shaJl doe, she bids me let it alone to her and I shall see she will bring them downe, and in the mean time hath sent her own slaves to come with all expedition, with whom, the Barricus & Mamfords [ = Mumfords] I shall make shift, having some stone left, but must desire you to send me 2 or 3 quarter casks of rumme , as also some brandy for the Queen, who drinks noe rumme. I wish it were once at an end, for every day b1ings a new charge with itt. The King of Acrom hath likewise plaied the rogue with me, putting a fetech upon the shell,66 for what reason I know not. The Queen hath sent to know the meaning, and suspecting it is for some more dashees hath taken the cloth you gave Prince at Christmas and sent him, soe hope we shall accommodate that bussiness, and in the meane time have some by me, enough to goe to worke when you send me scaffolding. By these their unjust dealing you may perceive what troble I have with them, they not being like the rest of the Negroes, who after they have once made up a palave r stands to what they have done. In Anguina I am plagued with the Cabbosheers, in Acrom the Cabbosheers are all friends and the King only plagues me.67 By my next I hope may give you a better accompt of affairs here. The Queen harps much upon her cloth, and indeed I doe beleive it would not be ill given considering, how firrne [var. 'farr'] she stands for the Companys interest and the great expence she is alt. She claims it as a promise made her man alt Christmas, as also a silver headed cane when the shipps come. 68 The say she sayes was a custome, being for a mourning cloth, which leave to your serious considerations, assureing you there shall be nothing wanting in me to bring the expence off as easy as possib le, acting for the Company as if it were my owne relations concemes. We have had both the Achims & A.rcanyes, the latter are most for English goods, the other requiring powder & arms, but the Dutch inter lopers lying soe constantly in the road doth much hinder me. By my accompts, which at the latter end of the month shall send, you will see what have disposed. In the rneane time if any oppertunity presents lett me have a bale of Welch plaines. I shall not be more large at present, fearing I have presumed too farr upon your patience. PS. Pray lett me have these following necessaries: nails of all sorts, some tarras, deale boards, bricks if possible. I have sent up to be mended or changed 3 crows, 3 wedges, l maull, 1 pick axe, I ades [=adze] , 1 axe. Our axes are most of them very much wome, wherefore be pleased to Jett us have 3 or 4 new ones.

I hope my worke hath not received much damadge, only one flanker, which I fear [I] must be forced to pull downe, the water having made a passage clear through the foundation. I have secured as well as I could the tops of the walJs by thatching, which I doe not think to pull off ti IL I see the weather settled. 70 In the mean time goe to provide stones, wood & shell against wee can worke, of all which doubt not to have sufficient quantities, having made up the palavers with the Acroms and [they] taken the fetich of the shell. Were the weather better, I could not worke, my whitemen being both sick, and the two black bricklayers lame with wormes, with eight other slaves. The Quamboers are up in arms, and we are advised intend to come this way, the Queen hath sent up to know the certainty, whose messenger we expect daily, the raines haveing detarded him, there is soe much water in the way that for these 14 dayes nobody could pass from Anguina to this place.

The fear which these people are in of them furthers me much in providing shell & stone, of both which I hope to have a large stock, that soe soon as the weather breaks up may regaine this lo t time, but wi h you could lett me have a carpenter if it were but only for a month, both to direct as alsoe to assist this black fellow, who is wilJing to worke but hath not that forecast 73 in him to lay the beams and contrive the staircase . For bricklayers, considering your necessities, shaU not press, only desire that when the dry times come in you would lett one that is a workeman come downe for 10 dayes to looke upon the flankers, which I formerly advised you was afraid had received damage. As for Johnson wbome I sent up, being lame, he may doe very well where there is other workemen, but wants as much directions as any blackman here , wherefore cannot rely on his judgement, and if I had my desire should rather have his roome than his company , he being such a quarrel some fellow [to] both whites & blacks. By this conveyance you will receive my accompts , which I have moderated as much as in me lyes, but doubt not in two months or three to bring them lower , for which reason I have discharged one of the free bricklayers, being but one indifferent workeman and very lazy. I assure you it would be much to my satisfaction could I find out any way to lessen the Company charge, knowing very well it would redound to my creditt, which in thi world i the cheif staff I rely on, but the many country I have to please and withal! the ill principalls [=principles] of the inhabitants considered , may I hope be a sufficient reason of my non abillity. It hath and doth give me noe small trouble to keep a union amongst them, for should they fall out and the Acroms joyne with the Aquomboers, which said [i.e. Aquomboe] King hath tryed all ways to effect, the Aquomboers would attempt to beate us from hence. The Anguina & Wynnebah Cabbosheer s are prepareing to go up to Acrom to take their fetich to be true to them and assist one another again t all enimie . The Acromes have been here and taken theirs. They are desirous I should goe along with them, but I have putt it off and shall only send Captain Quo and one anchor of rumrn. Soe soon as I can gett the carpenters worke fini hed shall runne up the front and two flankers and cover them with all expedition, which being effected shall not fear any of their palavers , it affording ufficient lodging for all our white men, were we twenty, and with one or two carpenters more may be finished in two months. You may have your carpenters againe in less time, for after they have laid the first floor this black fellow with their directions I hope may be able to lay the roofe. I have been to see some trees which are to bigg to bring down whole, but would make good joice s had I a two hand saw, and are not soe farr off but that may gett them downe without much troubl e or charge. Soe soon as I have the saw shall sett the sawyers to worke, the weather beginning now to open. I have not a naile in the Factory upon what occasion soever, which pray supply me with by the first opportunity, of severall sorts. The ballance, being 4oz 8a 4t, I send not up by this conveyance, it being a strange canoe, and besides am so plagued with interlopers since the Danes being at Accra, 74 who they say brings a com.mission to take all interlopers of what nation soever , that I know not whether shall take one era era of money before pay day. They sell their sheets to the Negroes att 12 & 13 for 8 angles, and the rest of their goods much att this rate.

I hope my last accompts are to your content. For deducting the eight gallons per month allowed att all Forts where there is noe building, you cannot I thinck look upon it to be lavish, if I have any assistance at all from the country people , and as to the powder you object against I can safely take my oath I have expended more only in answer ing salute s of shipps comeing into the road.

She miscarried about two months before, and never was well after, I cannot hear it was occasioned by any blows, bnt course of nature. Since which have had a worse misfortune, one of the Gambia slaves named Cbacnta, suspecting his womans honesty, after they bad left work tooke a knife & stabbed himself in two places in the belly, and would have done the same to her, had he not been prevented by the rest of the slaves. I sent for Capt. Towres Doctor, 80 who told me he lookt upon them [i.e. the wounds] to be mortal , for the undigested victualls issued out with the blood. However the Winnebah Cabbosheers undertooke the cure, but the next night after ( what frenzy I know not possest him) left his house & never hath been heard of since. I had another Gambia here who was sick att that time, and soe continued till about ten dayes agoe, when he gott up & worked with the rest of the slaves, but Friday night last he ran away, and was taken up at Quanso's croome.

The Queen proposed to send up to Anguina for a fetche to be taken by foure boys, one for Anguina, one for Acroomes, one for Winnebah , and one for Fanteene, 88 on which it fell the countrye to make satisfaction both for the se tallow as allsoe some goates and sheep I had lost. In the meane time [she] desierd me not to write to you [ms. 'y1'] According[ly] [she] dispachted a boy, at whose retume the Winnebahs woold have had her brought[= bring] his said fetches owt into the markett place, but she desierd to make experiment thereof first herselfe privately, which weather she did or not (and found it to fall on the Anguinas, as is suspected) 1 know not, butt [she] would never bring it owt, tho prest [ = pressed] to by the Winnebah, excuseing it that she exspected Quansoe and the Accroomes Cabbosheers hear to meet the Anguana who she had sent for down to woorke, and at there comeing it should be tried before them all, in which time I happened to have two ewes more stollen owt of the Forte where I had locked them upp, and being a raine[y] night traced the footings of them halfe way to Anguina, soe that it was the Anguinas that did it. The Winnebah, Accroomes [and] Quansoe being likewise come, whent to her and told her it lay now apon her to look owt the theives and make the white men satisfaction. Her answer was she had sent to Anguina about it, and if she could not heare of them she would goe up and let the white men retume to Cabo Corso Castle, [by] which answer you may perceive I am not likely to have satisfaction withowt the theives are found out or force be used, which latter course as it can be taken at any time shall at presant let alone, for fear of putting a stop to the woorke. Quansoe was very plaine with, her and told her it was a revenge apon the Anguinas but noe satisfaction to the white men, and as she had sent for them she ought to protect them and see noe harme came to them. They are now expecting the return of them sent in searchj who if bring noe news, and that she holds her resolution of goeing up, shall accomodate the business as well as I can, & dissemble my intention untell such time as I have force able to compell them to a compliance, for if she goes up through sham[e] of looseing her good name and esteem amongst the whitemen, which is her pretence, though I beleve it is the least occasion, the truth being to prevent makeing satisfaction, all concurring she ought to doe, what will not shame and revenge prompt that sex to do or act? I desier your speedy advice in the matter, and if you think fitt a more rougher course best, desier to you would sent down Captain Hansicoe immediatly to demand satisfaction in your names. If she comes away on Munday wee may gett her before the Cabbosheers parte, most of whome are against the Queen & Anguinas. Hear is and will be by Munday night most of the great men of Acroome and Anguina to meet Quansoe. I shall not trouble you further at present, if any novellitye happens shall advise. PS, I have sent two negroe men slaves. Pray order the Bomboy to send downe the Negroes irons I sent with the fonner men slaves. ",1694-10-06 00:00:00.000000,3,1095

The defferance I had with the Queen and the country of Anguina have made up, said Queen & CheifeCabbosbeer havein[g] takein itt upon theire selves, and promised in 14 dayes Ishould be sati[s]fied. After we had adjusted the matter I desiered they wouldconsider of the Forte, and after some small debate they agrede the Muffords should be sent for to comindeal [= commandeer], 90 being 4 quarters, each to be hear seven day[s], then to be released by the Anguinas, and them by the Aqua[n]soe people, 91 and them by the Accoromes [= Accroroes], which if they performe I doubt butt once round will finnish the Forte. One quarter hath bin heer and have woorked the seven dayes very well, the secon d came yesterday and this day fell to woorke, soe that I have and shall have a good parcell of shells and stone beforehand, sence my bricklayers are come to this disaster. Antony Brown I am forced to send up to gitt cured, and Quasso by an accidentia ll fall brook his armes, soe that now I have onely the Black I hiered here and the oldman which I can say are anything of woorkemen, vaggamonions 92 serving onely to fill in, and that with good looking after, to which make butt small redanse [= riddance] 93 in these thick walls, whereof if possible pray supply me with two in there roomes, for I feare these country people, seeing such a quantity of shells & stones ready as there will be in a little time I shall have, will be neglectfull of there woorke, and to bring downe the Cabbosheers againe will create a new charge, which be pleased to take into consideration. This' meeting of the Cabbosheeers have put me to a great expense, which I shall give you in a role [= roll] 94 aparte before I bring it into my accompts, to see what you are pleased to allow, being unwilling to have any more dispute. They all whent away highly contented, and swore to me I should not want stone or shells to finnish the woork, which I am the more induced to beleeve by reason Quonso [= Quanso] and they Anguinas have already sent some come heather to be in a readyness against theire people comes. Likewise I am informed that the Anguinas have allotted which quarters shall come first. If you can help me at this push I doubt not butt to have it finnished by next month a[t) least. You may withdraw some of your woorkmen if these accidents had [not?] happended . I must desierd you to send one downe to instruct these I had in laying the bricks to cover the roof, that I might not have it to do over againe. I could have had a good part of the forte ready to cover, butt I left of woorking on those thine [sic:= thick?] walls, which took soe muc h lime, and [there are] few stone to goe apon the front flanker, which devours more stone, to have as littell lye in f[ull] view of the Maneford [= Mumford], who are afetching stone, as possible can. The carpenter was taken sick two days sence and still keeps his house, complaineing of great paines, soe that now I am quete distitute, and whe re he in perfect health he is not able to keep t[r]acke with the brick[ layers], bes ides wants derectio ns to fite the starecase.

I fear the carpenter will not be able to woorke in a small time, which will be a great disapointement withowt you can supply me with another in his roome . By Satterday night hall have my third flanker ready to cover. The Queen is gone up into her one [=own] countrye. Att her departure 1 thought she would have quarrelJ with me because I would not sati ffye her greedy averice. She sent to acquainte me of her jomey, and withall to know with what I would take my leave of her, whereupon I sent her a piece of perpetuanoe & 3 sheets for her cheife boys, which at the present she seemed to accept very kindly, but at night, I noe [=know) not what possesed her, [she) returned (them], aying it was to littell, which so aggravated me that 1 took them and locked them up, and swore she should have noething more. To afront me stripped her selfe of the cloath she wore, which was that you sent her, and sent it by one of her women, her Cheife boy refu eing to bring itt, with this message that if she had the rest of the things the English had given her [she] would returne them, but when she came into the country would send satisfaction.

The next day [I] a ked her [omission] weather she remember s what she had done to me, or that the Cabbosheers had made herselfe sensable of what affronts she had put apon me I know not, butt she sent her boy, who I sent back with this answer, that I was none of her boy[s] , wherefore he ent the foresaid Cabbosheers to take me by forst [=force] , with whome I whent, where after she had begged parding [=pardon] and owned her faulte he gave me t[w]o potts of wine as an acknowledgement, which I proffered to the Cabbo beer . I thought fitt to give you an accompt , not that I fear any quarrell will insue, butt that you might ee what a perplexety I live in, and that if any quarrell happens you may not attribute to any rashenes of mine but some great provocation , as alsoe to incite [you] to afford me what assistance can of woorkemens, that now I have shells and stones may putt myselfe in a posture of defense.

When I saw him I bid my boys ask him what he did there.

I am apt to beleive that it was a designed thing to fall out with my boy, to cover their roaguery, haveing never had a sillable of difference with either of these fellows, or any in the towne, whicn makes me think they were set on by some Peter Passop, a cheife actor in Succondee tragedy, 160 being then there, who acknowledged he was told of it, but he was drunk and gone to sleep, which was his excuse to me the next day. This narrow escape of my life [I) was forced to be content with, as well for want of souJdiers as officers, which was our ganison well supplyed with the natives durst never offer such affronts, and commit murders as they dayly doe, tho ' ever so much prompted to our by our barbarous neighbours, 161watching and waitingwith patience to come up with these villaines.

Had I been only to bought ( = buy) slaves, I might [have] bought 3 or 4 hundred since I have been here, and I am certaine if I had but good goods I might have taken above one hundred bendeys, for here is a country that lyes near here, between this & Quamboe, that trades with money & has it plenty, but cannot goe to Accra by reason of the Quamboers, and they correspond with noe country nor Cabbosheers without it be with Addoe of Quambo e or their pe-ople, and Addoe hath sent here to me twice & has promised to give pawns with the King of this place which is considerable, either their sons or two hundred bendys, and has promised as soon as answer comes from your Worships he will come down himself. Upon the perusall your Worships will send a flagg by the bearer & a little brandy for a sirrup, if it be but a pint. Here are oyster shells in abundance within half a quarter of a mile of this place, and stones & wood in abundance. They promise they will fetch shells, stones & wood, and help to doe anything the white man your Worships shall plea se to send will command . The people here are very civill, for you may Jett your things lye anywhere [blank], for they worship a white man more than they doe their feteec hes.

I have had great trouble with the goods to putt them off, by reason of their being soe much damaged.

13_Whydah_Law_Volume_III_p568_587.txt,"1344. Edward Jackline Widah, 10 May 169225 ","This accompanie Mr John Anshworth,26 and is to acquaint your Worships of the strange revolutions that have hapned in these parts, for on the 21 Aprill last about 11 aclock at night Mr Wortly, goeing out to the French Factory here, was by the French men pinnyaird and keept prisoner in their house, and presently all the Gold Coa t Negroes here27 gott up in armes, o that we thought they were comeing to take the Factory, for Mr Wortly had panyaird 4 of them some time before and keept them in irons. The next day Mr Worthly sends me ane order to deliver the French men 2 marks gold, the value of 10 slaves in goods and six musquets. I sent him word again that for the gold and goods I would deliver, but I did not think it convenient to deliver the armes to an enemie that threatned to take the Factory, for by that means he might accomplish hi desire. He [i .. the French factor] said he would not have the goods except [= without] the armes, and that he would have them or Factory, so I immediatly acquainted the King what the French had done and what they designed, who ent me word again that I need not fear them, for they should not hurt the Factory, and I knew that without his assistance they could not. Sometime after the King askt him whither Mr Wotthly owed him anything, he said no, but he had been at great charge to gett people to watch and look after his Factory for fear of us, and withall told me what need I trouble myself so long as I had Mr Worthly order, for it was non of mine,for at last they would have taken the 2 mark of gold and 10 slaves in goods without the gunns, but then I would not give it them, I told them so long as he [= Wortley] wa hi prisoner he could make him notice what he pleased. I told the King if he would force me to give it I would, but I told him withal! if he suffredthe French to do so he must not expect us to tay long in his country, so the King told him he should have nothing. The French, seing they could gett nothing out of me, aid I would not give the things becau J would have him (= Wortley) keep there. Mr Answorth can acquaint your worships what I did, who spook very much for Mr Worthly against the French. I told the King he did not do well to suffer the French to do so. At the same ti.me I askt Lhe King why he suffred the French to pinnyajr Mr Worthly, he said it was by [ms. 'be'] his order, because he had correspondence with O.ffree,his enimie, and t.hreatned him that Offree should come and take his country, and for pinnyairing the interlopers canoe and canoemen, and severall other things, and that he would have [had] Mr Worthly out of his house by force before that time if it had not been for fear the rable should have plundr ed the Factory. Yet r indeavoured as much as I could for his inlargement, but all in wain, for they would not suffer me to see him. At last I desired the King to remove him to some other place, which he did, and sett him aboard an interloper, Capt. James Bruser,28 then lying at anchor in this road. I askt the Captain how he could answer carrieing the Companys Factors out of the country, he said the King forced him to do it. I know Mr Worthly and the Captai n had a falling out sometime before , which was the reason I believe he was so willing to carry him off. Whille Mr Worthly Jay at the French house he wrotte a letter to the King promiseing him a great dashee if he would end the pallavour, which he[= the King] forcied me to give him. I askt him why he wou ld take it, seeing he would not suffer Mr Worthly to stay, he said the Dutchmen that arc pinnyaird at Offra had given a great deall more and was neer the better, 29 so f was forcied to comply unlessc I would accompany Mr Worthly. I sec the letter he wrotte to the King (and Tbelieve Mr Answorth did), wherein he promised him 5 slaves, and 2 of them [i.e. 2 more] I was forcied to give him to remove him from the Frenchmans, for that he was keept in irons in a nesty place, so they have had 7 slaves already , and the Cabbosheers are now at me for somethi ng, and then I believe this bussines will be ended . Sometime before this bussinese Mr Worthly had pinnyaird a Gold Coast mans canoe for a debt which another owed, which canoe was brock bringing up to the Factory, so that they would be paid for it and will not take lesse then 2 slaves, and [there was also] one of the interlopers canoemcns hire, for which he [=Wo rtley] received gold and left me to pay them with goods. Perhaps may be some cxpencesse about this unlooky [= unlucky] bussines to gett people to look after the Factory (for we did expec t the French were come ing to take the Factory), and yett as little as possible could be. The King is resolved to have our flanckers [ms. 'planckers' ) down, and becaus I desired him Lostay till we had a shipp here he told me if I did not resolve upon it f should accompany Mr Worthly, but he said at the same time if I broak doun ours the French should break down theirs, who had built one spite of Mr Wortly, who resisted him very much.30 They [ = the Whydah people?] only waite for a French ship and its thought the Chief [sc. of the French factory] will be sent away likewise. They [ = the French] have not had a ship for these 2 years and they are alwayes quar[e)ling amongst themselves, especially the Chief and 2d, who pretends he is equall with the Chief. The 26 April Capt. Butterams mate came here from Little Popo with letters for Mr Wortly,3 1 but not your Worships letter, so I desired the King to Jett me send up to Popo by the river,32 but by no means would he suffer me, for he was affrayed I should send to Offree to come upon the country for what they had done to Mr Wortly, and the mate told me he could not tell me whither the ship would come doun or no. Slaves are very plenty here, for the 2 interlopers were dispatched in a month and carried of bettween them 1000 slaves, they departed hence the 3d instant, by whom I have wrotte to the Company concerning the affairs here.33 After Mr Worthly went off I had liberty to goe to him and carry him his books and papers, which I did, and the inventory, which he well approved of, that on the back side he acknowledged it contained all the goods of the Factory which he could well tell by his accompts. The coppie of the inventory corns i_nclosed, which you will find not taken presently, for we were forcied to stand on our guaird till the bussines was pretty well ended, yet in the mean time nothing was imbazeiled [= embezzled], as he himself accknowl.edgetb, but in the 1st night in presence of all the white men here I opened his chair [ = chest?] and weighed his gold, of which he sayes 2 mark is wanting, but his boy that keept his key is fleed, and I could not gett him again till the ships were gone. Mr Wortly according to his desire took aJl his things with him, and I understand Mr Wortly has left more [orders] with the French for me to deliver goods, if he has it will creat a great dale of trouble, but all I ever could gett sight of I gott. The King [blank] the Facto1y here and the concerns thereof are safe, and my industry shall not be wanting to keep them so. Here is no resisting the country, which was Mr Wortleys ruine, for he depending for Offrees sending him people so could never comply with them. The King sayes that if the white men correspond not with his enemies nor pinnyair his people non shall wrong them, but if they doe he is resolved to serve them the same trick. This country is exterordinaiie fearfull of Offrees comeing, which he will certainly do, for be has gott a great dale arnunition out of a Dutchman for the same purpose. Our King is very angry becaus Capt. Butteram stays at Popo, and yett will not lett me send to him but by sea, which requires so much time, it being again[st) wind and currant, yett I do intend to send to him that way, for I am afrayed he will not come down here, becaus he stays so long. Here is but 2 white men besides my self, and the French has eight, but most of our slaves can handle armes, so there is no fear of the French doeing us any harme. I suppose Capt. Butterams canoe will be goeing from hence in a little time, by them shall inlarge. 34 In the mean time shall be carefull of the Royall Companies concerns here. ",,3,1344

'Whyadh'), 13 Oct. 1692 ","Yours of the first September last have received, and accordingly I acquainted the King that if he suffred us to be affronted by the French or any other, that your Worshipps would withdraw the Factory, upon which he seemed very much troubled, and promised me [I] should not be molested for the future. Capt. Butteram sailled from Little Po Po the 14 May last directly for Barbadoes, which made the King extream angry, he askt why we keept a Factory and our ships slaves at another place. The interlopers when here last told the King the Company was broack, & that no more Companys shipps would come upon the 1stCoast, which the King does believe. When I heard of Capt. Butteram comeing to Po Po, with what vendable goods was in the Factory I purchased 25 slaves for him, but he not comeing I was forced to keep them till ane oppertunity presented to dispose of them. I understand Capt. Butterarn carryed [away] a great many goods, the remains of his cargoe, which would have done very well here, and if the Commanders look no more upon the Factory then they have done its needlesse to keep it. July the 3darrived here the Pondare, Capt. Compree, a French ship of 36 guns.35 At Ashenee he took a small Dutch interloper, 36 and at Po Po he meet Capt. Bell & after 7 houers dispute took him, most of Bells men being ashore and took[= taken], but the French minding the plunder more then minding the ship lett her run ashore so soon as they had taken her, it being night.37 Several! of the Englishmen that were left aboard were drounded. He brought the Captain and 16 men here, 7 of which were put ashore, whom I was forced to intertain, or elce they might have been starved. Heres not been a ship here except the French ship since Mr Wortly went away, all staying at Po Po. Offree put tricks upon all of them, for when Capt. Bell came to anchor there he promis'd to slave him in 10 dayes, but after Offree had got some goods and white men ashoree he lay there 3 weeks without getting on[e] slave, if he had come down hee had been dispatched before the French came, and when Capt. Parish38 came he did the same with him, for after he had gotta sedane and some other things which Parish had brought for the King,39 he made him pay 30 slaves for the diet of some of Capt. Bells men, and Parish fearing he might do him more rnischeife went off with 100 slaves short of bis compliment. There was but a small quantity of goods left by Mr Wmtly, and no ship bas been here to make any advantage of it, and it is a great charge to maintain this Factory, here being nigh 50 slaves belonging to the house, and if 1 should dispose of any of them it might endeavour the [ms. 'there') running away of the rest, neither can they be well spared, for the rains has been here so extream that it has washed doun great part of the Factory, which wants tha[tJching very much, and it will require cost and time to repair it again. The 2 white men here have had no wages this 13 months, for which they are very troublesome. They say when they served Captain Whyburne they had their wages constantly paid them,40 but now they are in the Companys service they can have nothing, and here is no gold to pay them, nor goods neither excepting a few bowges, all the rest is worth nothing, most part of it being here when Whyburne was interlopeing, so I desire your Worships to take it into consideration, for it will be very hard to stay till the Companys ships come if they come not sooner then they us[ed] to do, besides here is no man will stay if they have not their wages, the two here having 32s per month each. Offrey is now upon his march towards Whydah, and what will be the esue [=issue] of it I can't tell. The King makes very little of it, but his dependancy is upon the Quamboars, to whom he has given a wast [ = vast] sum in agree[= aggrey], couecumber [= cowcumber]41 and corall, and Offrey has given them as much, so that they are divided one part for Offree and the other part for the King of Whydah, in a short time we shall see the conc lusion.42 The Dutch are up in the Kings town, and [we] are in a great dale of fear they do intend to build a Factory about half a mille from ours.43 Here is a report that Offree intends to destroy all the white men here, but that is raised by the King of Whydah, so that there is no fear of any such thing. The only goods in esteeme here is bougecs, [iron] barrs, corraU, long cloths, rangoes if good, pintadoes, pO]attilloes, red pcrpetuanoes or silks. If ships hath other there best way is to dispose of them for gold.44 Here they give two says or two boysadoes for a woman or 3 blue perpetuanocs, which is worth a great dale more to windward. If your Worshipps please to send doun a canoe with something, the same will serve to slave next shipp that comes, slaves being plenty enoug h here and likely to containow so.

There is severall things daily gone to ruine, for they care not what they spoile or what they lose, and if a man tells them they begin to curse & sweare, & then they are for going ashore, and there is never a time I have carried bricks but still wee have these differences, which I am sure if they were aboard of any shipp that comes on the Coast, they would doe more worke in a weeks time than they doe here in a quarter of a yeare. I have now left one of our Dutchmen ashore at Wynnebah for abuseing of me & denying goeing aboard, and telling me he did not come to be a slave to carry bricks ashore, which I bid him tell that att Cabo Corso, and he swore sacraments that he could doe as well as I.

Nay, these two consorts at Cabo Corso tooke the boate ashore unknown to me, and the Frenchman to fight, and as soon as the one drawed his knife the other (which is the fellow who struck me) gott up a great stone and letts drive att his head, almost beat his braines out, which marke he carried for severall weeks afterwards.

If we should bring up all the violations the English nation has commilted on this Coast to the great injury and irreparable damage of the Netherlands Company, we could raise it at length, but to be brief, they set some people to build a fort at Craa, a musket shot from our lodge, watching for the time when we were in dispute with the King of Great Acraa6 in the year 1674, 7 by which we were also obliged to build a fortress, so as not to be dispossessed one day of the Company 's property, 8 as also at 'Zacconde,9 [and} at Dickies Shoo.ff otherwise called Jnfuma in our directorship, 10 and at Commany in the year 1668 in the directorship of the late Mr Dirk Wilree, although he protested at that time against Mr Thomas Pearson agent for the Royal Company, 11 which refused to leave the place and afterwards held it in its possession until the Commany war in the year 1688, when they were obliged to abandon the same, therefore it cannot be judged, although the English unrightfully had a lodge at Commany in its possession for twenty years, that the Netherlands West India Company should have lost its right, and are bound to tolerate the English again, because the same was already granted in the year 1641 in the directorship of Mr Jacob Ruyghaver on behalf of the High and Mighty Lords States General of the United Netherlands, and the same General Chartered West India Company, 12 and afterwards renewed in the directorship of Jasper van Heussen in the year J659, since the English nation began to importune the King of Cominay to have a lodge on the shore alongside the Hollanders, 13 whence the land from the River Chama to Elmina, as far as the jurisdiction of the King of Great Cominay extends, [was] sold to the Netherlands Company for sixteen bendas gold, with the following condition., that the Commanies should have no power for them or their successors to grant to other nations whoever they may be, any towns or places to conduct trade or commerce there, build houses, lodges or forts, indeed not even to land, or to be permitted to do anything that would break with the latter, and this right [so] obtained their High & Mightinesses the Lords States General of the United Netherlands and the same Chartered West India Company may proclaim, which they shall be in a position to ordain against anybody who shall wish to prejudice it in such a way, as against that they should be willing to withdraw what is theirs, which they have occupied solely and heritably, to which they vow faithfully to assist and maintain the same, since on our right to the foresaid coast and what is dependent on or of it, granted once and for all, we shall do and announce anything to keep and maintain it against any deliberate or undeliberate means to the prejudice of these acts of cession and grant, from which it is sufficiently established that the whole shore from Elmina westward to the River Chama bordering on the territory of the king of Jab/ 4 belongs to the Netherlands Company as its property, therefore we wish by these to warn your Honours in a ve,y friendly and neighbourly way not to make an attempt on this Commany shore, whether by force of arms or surreptitious means to corrupt the natives, as also at all places which the Netherlands Company has conquered by right of arms and have been granted by the natives and bought for gold, whereby the trade or commerce occurring there belongs to the Company as its property, otherwise we shall be forced to take in hand other measures, and since the King of England is united with their High and Mightinesses the Lords States General in a ve,y close alliance with each other, we will not hope that your Honours will [word illegible] and disturb the same between the two nations, but as peace .loving persons they will be contented with the places and forts which they presently have in their possession, but in case they happen to undertake the contra,y, we protest in the name and on behalf of their High & Mightinesses the Lords States General of the United Netherlands together with the same General Chartered West India Company that we wish to be free of such damages, accidents and inconveniencies which the English and our nation may come to meet by your Honours' unrightful enterprises, as we on our side likewise will behave according to our bounden duty to take care of and maintain that which rightfully belongs to the Netherlands Company in full ownership, and otherwise to behave so as to cultivate the good alliance between both nations.
