As to Dickiscove pallavora, I cannot come to speake with any of the Cabasheers of the said place, the people ofthis place haveing abused some of their wives which hath bred a differance betwixt them both soe that they panyar 56 one anothe r. Tickadoe is comei ng downe to fight that place, they haveing alsoe abused the Addooms severall times, and when hee doth come bee hath sent the Dutch here word that he will not show them a trick unless they remove. Wee are in great want for more powder alsoe brass basons which are a greate comodyty amongst the Wassa's, here being above 100 bendy's in towne att this time for those two sorts of comodyty's. If the Royall Companys factory was built and was but supplyed with powder, sheets and brass basons and green Welch plaines, the Dutch would take but little gold, and that as they would take would be for beades. If your Worship can possibly spare more powde r I have ready money in hand for 30 barrells and here is also 10 bendy's for brass basons which I hope your Worship will be soe kind as to supply us with. I now send your Worship 7 marks, 7 ounces per the bearer hereof hopeing your Worship will supply us with the abovesaid goods.

Not long since their came two men about midnight to our factory to rob it as we suppose which is very probable was their intent, for they had noe business their at that time of night, but the carpenter overhearing them make their pallaver stept out with a musquet charged with small shot to se what they were, but as soon as they espi'd him they ran away, upon which he fired after them and shot one of them, by which the next day we knew him to be one of this town, so demanded of him what he want'd at that time of night about the factory. All he could plead was a great Capushere was buried their and he came to dig for gold which was buried with him, but all the blacks said that was a blind excuse, for none of them could remember any Cabusher being buried their, but however this fellow affter he was well out of reveng for bis hurte, panyard two of our women slaves and was a carriing them up to Axim to sell them, he being of that cuntrey although now inhabitent here, but was stopt by the Braffo68 of Tagarado.

Your honour has been pleased to command my small opinion about rebuilding the Royall Companys factory , which is as followeth. Att the first place in my opinion itt will be more profittable and secure for the Company to rebuild the factory where itt was formerly or there about, by reason itt is the only place to build a fort at, it being higher ground then any place att Commenda; alsoe [it is] the Royall Com.pany's owne ground, itt is to windward of all the towne, to prevent fire, in short a small fort being built can command both sea and land. Secondly am advised by Captain Bracon and others here, that if your honour dus not resolve to sett both the people of Great and Small Commenda very speedily about building the old factory, that the raines will goe neare to prevent the finishing of itt, for I count but 3 months till the raines comes in.

If you will send deale boards in the cannoe I could keep the carpenters att woorke on flowering of the hall and three other roomes, for I cannot keep any goods dry in the warehouse for want of boards. Last night theire came into this road a Pourtigueze, and there being a Ducth galley 163 and a great Ductb shipp likewise, therefore I sent my Gunner on board, that they might not take her in the rood, butt the Ducth galley fiered a shott into my canno, but the canno got on board, with that the galley manned her boats and the second of the Mina came on boards hal[f] an hour after the Gunner and demanded to [know] what he did tbeire, and he told them to keep the vessall from them, with that he bid him be gone or he would send him owt of her presently , that the Gunner came on shore, therefore I could not do anything more therein, thinking it might not be amiss to acquaint you therewith.

That man and the King came to aquainte me herewith, and I sent for all the Cape Coast souldiers and slaves, that he might see them, and he found onely two of them, that was Harries slave, and (he] confesed before all the Cabbosheers that he was one, and Anshrewey was the other, which is a slave of Hansicoe s of Cape Coast, confesing he was in the house, but they both deny they had any sheer [=share] in the gold or other thing that wa in the bagg, which the Cabbosheer value to be worth 3a, butt they say Cape Coast Toms son hath the bagg and what their [=there] wa . Now this being down [=done] on Thursday night, on Friday morning the great can no whent from hence, and that Cape Coast Tom('s on) in her, and that noebody but Quashe that command the souldiers know as fare as I can learne, and he [=QuasheJ said he [=Tom ' s son] told him he was Yavv y, for all my boy whent in the ame cannoe, yet he did not know that [ms.

Captain Bristow said he had an order from your Worship to put six chest of sheets ashore here, but haveing so many of the last that was sent me remayning I refused them, my trade being dull. From the time of my sending for powder to the end of the month, l took but five ounces of gold, and yet not above a week before they were mad for powder and cleared the Dutch of all theres, so that my trade is such a lottery 1 know not what to advise for, for they are eager for a sort of goods, just as I send for them , I am not certain they will vend when they come upp. The Antea people say the war lyes betwixt Wassaws and !dooms spoils trade and the cuntrey people say it is the unjust dealings of the An tea people, so that what with one and with [ms. 'wt'] the other I have small encouragement when it is like to be better. What[ = that] the upland wan hinders I know , but I am certa in the Antea make it worse for there came a man and bought five peas in goods at our factory and the town panyard it from him, which is a common trade amoung them and [they] some times sell the traders two [= too] for a slave, wlaich makes them afraid to come down. I would have gott leave of the Antea to have sent up the cuntrey with some dashes for the upland Cabushers to se if I could have made trade better or elce to have had better sattisfaction to the contrary, but they would nither consent to my goeing or sending any body and to offer it without their consent were a vaine attempt, for they would certainly doe him a mischeife. The person I have now sent down with my accompts is Hastings Ingram, who being to civilly used groweth upon my kindness and doth not behave himselfe of late as he ought to doe [ms. ' does'], he says he came of great freinds, and upon that I suppose he thinks himselfe to be to good to be under my command, his behaviour being more like a master than servant and canot show me less respect than he doth, without he should tell me playnly he is my fellow, perhaps he hath been a better man than ever I shall, yet now I think he ought to be so, so long as I am placed by your Worship as his master, so humbley desire your Worship to give him a check or elce detain him and send another man in his room which your Worship shall think fit to doe.

As for the perpetuanoes that are wanting, Peter, a Black in the towne, declares he brought traders some small time before Mr Goreing deceased that bought seventy, and the said Goring gave him a niconee & the trader a carpet to encourage them, & Francis Nixson declares that he saw thirty perpetuanoes deliver'd, & Mr Goring should say that was the remaincs of the blue perpetuanoes. One lead barr he cutt into sluggs & gave the blacks with powder to burne Canconnock[s] croomc. 182 One half firking tallow he sold Peter, it being damaged, for 2a 6ta. I have examined the Serjeant & the men, who will all declare upon oath not the least thing of the Company has been deliver'd out of the warehouse from the death of said Goring till Mr Jordan & Mr Pinck came. I should have sent the serjeant downe, but he is troubled with a violent feavour & ague, & his leggs so swelled that he is scarce able to goe, and roost of the men downe with other distempers, & provision so carce that they are ready to starve. As to the Serjeant[s] paper [it] was a coppy taken from said Goring, & [he] further declare he did not know what good was in the warehou e. As for the difference in the inventory , Mr John Pinck has disposed of some goods which he will give your worships accompt. I have further inquired after Mr Gorings estate, & am inform'd he sent two canoes with perpetuanoes to Cabo Corso Castle and consign'd them to the French Doctor,183 they were bought out of the interloper. Mr Goring was to pay 8mk , the French Doctor the ballance, the whole amounting to 15mks, but what returns was made I cannot learn. Further he laid out with the interloper 11oz in Cabe de Verde cloaths. 184 What I have write concerning the Royall African Company & said Goring in the foregoing part of this letter is the best information I can give at present. Here are several) palavers about Harry the Bomboy, and the people are oe di attisfied with him that they are re olved never to bring trade to the fort till he is remov'd, soe shall keep him till further orders. The reason detaining the canoe so long was by sea being soe bad that noe canoe could goe off. When the seas being abated, intending to forward the canoe, [I] had information the Mine did panjard all the canoes that was belonging to Cabo Cor o Castle .185 The reason which gave me to suspect it [was that] the canoe we sent to advise your Worships of the death of Mr Jordan is not returned. I have received yours of the 3dof May, & accordingly have sent away the five hand canoe with John Pinck. We have had for these eight days last past such violent rains that one of the flanckers is downe, & the rest I believe will falow [= follow] if the rain hold. The reason that I have not sent anything that belong to Mr Goring is because they will take damage, so shall referr it till forther orders. J humbly desire your Worships for God sake to send another person to take care of the Companys concern , that I may come to Cabo Corso and not lye & perish here, for there is noe sustanance to be had.

I might then well make myself a party when the affront was put on me. As for following [ms. 'fallowing' ) Mr Johnson,s courses, 198 I disown them and regard my owne sefety more, not designeing to loose my life & ruin my security upon such trifle pallavers, though if occasion were (which God forbid) should as willingly loose my blood in their service as any other of the Companys servants. The ounce I am not as yet paid, neither was it given to me, but [to] the boy & slave who were sufferers. I acknowledge that I did fire att canoes in the bay, but they did not belong to this place, butt were Mine canoes, that buy up all the come before it is fitting to take in, & we all ready to starve for want of bread, being forced for six small cankys a day to pay six angles the two months, & it cannot be expected that 285 lb beafe can last for ever. Their oyle or fowles they will not sell to us, but the Mina canoes may buy them under rate. In short, they would be rogues, if they had witt enough, & their designe [ms. 'desinge') I believe is to starve us. I have by me twenty butts oyster shells, & wood within a small matter to burn a kill of 50000 bricks, & should have been much forwarder if these people would have given their assistance as they ought to have done. The custome in palavers you mention the Dutch use, 199 it was also used att this place but never brought up by me, but it being your order to the contrary shall most strick.ly observe, & for the future, unless it co ncerns my masters intrest, shall on no terms whatsoever concern my self in any of their palavers, but leave them to their owne laws & customes. I had not concerned myself in this, but you ordered me to be assisting to Hucame, 200 and he being such an old foo l, they would never have done it if I had not gone, so that my goeing was in obedient to your orders. The report goes in these parts, that the Copeman of Butteroe has order to raise what force he can in these parts to oppose John Cabess & Taggee, 201 the former of which we hear the Dutch Copeman of Commenda had wounded. 202 As I hear further of anything of consequence shall advise you. I have not a coppy of the articles of agreement by me & to the best of my remembrance never see the originall but once, so by retume of this canoe desire a coppy, also another man in the roome of William Phillips, whom 1 am forcedto send downe by reason of his !eggs.

TheCopeman tells mee hee bath found but small trade since his comeing, which heedoes not much notice soe long as there are noe goods att the Mina to supply himwith but soe soone as supplyes come, which are dayly expected by foure ships fromEurope, hee expects to have a considerable trade though little to his masters profitt for hee says that by his brothers54 order hee will undersell all ships that comes inthe road , they selling soe cheape as they will. The trade is but little att present,which is d1e reason that the boysado's and perpettuanoe s remaine unsold, but Captain Bracon desires mee to acquaint your honour that there is some probabillity in selling the perpettuanoes as likewise a considerable quantity more before any ships come downe to hinder the trade, for he sayes that soe long as your honour will sell the RoyaJJ Companys goods att the same rates the Dutch does that they shall have but little trade in such goods as your Honour consignes to this place, which truely I verryly beleeve hee haveing the whole trade of the place in his hands.

This day about twelve or fourteen more went, they ay to call more from the croomes. I continually urge them to call their people in a body, for now was the time to gaine the favour of your Worshipps. They always promise well but doe nott perlorme accordingly . This day the King must have two sheets for the fetish, or else the Castle would be taken, which I gave them. Your Worshipps being pleased to order recruits to us, doe mightily annimate my spiritts. I hope they will stand true, and I fear none of them, but hope to putt things in better order among us here. I have nott spared to labour day and night with head and hands to gett all things in readiness, and the best order as po sible could, and doe keep a strict watch in the night, and will to the utmo t of my power doe all I can for my ma ters intrest.

As for the European provisions I shall not be att all lavish of them, but the soldjers have nothing else to live upon, so that had need be well supplyed with all sorts. I desire to be enformed what powder, rum & palme oyle is allowed monthly for the use of the fort. Att this time there is much powder used both by the whitemen and blacks in clearing their armes once or twice a weak, soe that I hope you will pleased during these troublesome tymes to allow something extrodinary on accompt of the powder. According to order have sent downe the Black carpente r Alampo, whom we shall want as well as the rest in a ven-y short tyme. They must be sure to bring all such toolls along with them as will be used for cutting and squaring of tymber and about the carpenters work.

He never would keep all to the Companys work, but wou ld dayly have par t of them to fetch his wood , to sell in the market for his owne use. I have at present put in one Coffee, a lusty young black fellow, one that speak s English verry well, and I beleive will behave himselfe civilly. Since my last rhave paid all the slave s Ia each, but the bomboy none. Pray if my boy is not come away send up the laves accompts, that they might be cleared to a day, for they are hard put to it to gett victualls , & the white mens pay, they being very much necessitated to gett provitions, everytheing here being att an unreasonable rate. I am now forc'd to pay 9 taccoes for 5 little boys , & glad that I can gett them for mony. Pray end a skeain of Englisch match & 6 balls [ms.

Wee are all so lame with our late journey that wee are hardly able to stir. All our towns people are gone, some to one place & some to another; wee have not so much as any body to bring us any news, since the town people are gone.

The ship that came downe the other day ly's in Anishan roade is an interloper, hee wont tell his ships name nor his owne, but the Blacks say they call him Capta in James and hee snuffles in the nose, that is all I can leame of the Blacks. As to trade itt is verry small att present , for I have taken but one bendy this two dayes of trade and that was for iron barrs, but I hope when the interloper is gon and the Dutch sayes, I shall have a trade againe.

This morning I sent againe, and the Blacks had admittance, but not to come nigh the cabin door, which was guarded with two musquittes, a thing not usual! on board honest merchant men, nor will they sell any goods for gold, but offer to barter for slaves. Those circumstances do perswade me that he is a rogue, and I have given Captain Buttram notice of it, by returne of the message. I understand that you have sent 20 men to his assistance, which 1am glad off, for he cannot be too secure. If you please to give me any instructions they shall be duly observed. "

The instant I gott a canoe that weot 12th aboard and came safe ashoar againe, in which I wrote for a barrell of powder, & the Captain sent me a barrell of powder, a little biskitt & 2 peices of beef with your letter. 105 As for the ship we know there was one att Cabo Corso, and their she might have stayed for any service she will doe us. He might have landed the first or second day if he would have man'd his boats, the Dutch thinking we had some force in our towne, but since the Dutch being of great strength, haveing about a hundred men in armes ransacking about our towne , & about 40 small canoes att sea, that it would be hard for us if the goods were landed to secure it in the fort , haveing no body in our towne to assist us. As for your six black soldiers [they] are a thing of nothing, for if they were ashoar they would not stay with u two minutes but would be scampered into the woods, and indeed what doe six signifie? I reckon in a day or two more they wiU not suffer us to fetch any water. If your worships had sent 10 or 12 white men & about 30 or 40 blacks, it had been ome incouragment, with a supply of powder & provitions, yett your worships may stand by us yett, only delays are dangerous. Send to the King of Aguaffo to send down 40 or 50 soldier , & the Captain of ship to man but one boat will scare all the Dutch canoes, that they will not come near him, for they are a parcell of cowardly dogg . This 12 instant came likewise here 140 Adoomes Shrevys [men], and went to the camp to aid Little Taggee. 106 And as for the slaves, I would send them aboard if I could, but cannot so much as gett 2 two hand canoes if I would give a mark of gold, and [how] I shall send this letter I know not.

The people say you make sure of the Companys concernes as their goods & slaves &c, tho they signifie nothing to us, it is white soldiers & black solders wee want, they might as well have come by land as it was proposed for as to goe downe by land. The Dutch have store of whites & black, but what doe I say any more for when to no purpose? I am doubtfull this may prove a second Succondee [ms.

'prier'}. I cannot conveniently draw out accompt for this place by reason know not the mens pay due to them (or each of them), but have supplyed them with money to serve their occations, tho have not called to a generall pay. I had last week ome Cuffra men down, whos[e) business was to take fetiche with John Cabes that no traders or their good should be panyard that came downe here (on mens heads that owed John Cabess money) , which after had passed on both sides, the Cufferas promised to be downe in fifteen days. John Cabess hath ent a man with him into the Cuffera countrey to take a fetich for him, which palJaver I now perceive is the reason I have sold but five perpetuanoes and a chest and a halfe of sheets of the goods you sent me, but now in all probabillity I shall have a vast trade, not only thence but from the Addoomes. Yesterday our cook, one of the five old slaves you ordered me to pay come to, i mising. He went for wood, a the other slaves tell me, whether he run away because be was not paid as the other are or (is] panyard, I cannot tell. I sent the Bombay and old slaves after him, also John Cabess soldier, who brought me word they trackd his foot teps over the salt pond towards the Dutch Fort. I then sent the Bomboy to know if he was there , and also to demand of him a child, which Little Taggees men had stole, and was in his custody, or he could procure , as he sent me word by his boy with his cane , but when the Bomboy came to the Castle gate he was stop'd (the like he never did before) and the Copeman sent me word that he had or knew of [n]either of them, and sent me word I should take what followed if I sent anybody to hi Fort againe. The reason I suppose [is] that three of his soldiers run away from his Fort, and perhaps mi tru t me that I intice them, but I hear they are gone to the Mine for want of food there. Shall want boards to turn the arch of the tanck, and 1000 20d, 10d & 6d nailes, some countrey match, wedges to break stone, and maules. "

Also I desi re you wou ld be pleased to send me an accompt of every mans pay, and from what time due, and your orders for my paying them, and also an accompt of !he customes that is allowed for this place, which mightil y want, not haveing what it is. Comenda, 17 May 1697393. William Gabb According to your worshipps order have been at Cape Tres Pointas, with lwo sawyers from Cape Coast and the two sawyers 1 had here, and with much adoe gott six slaves at Dicl<ies Cove, Mr Vincent126 was not willing to Jett me have any, but with these I have cutt down six trees, which make near fifteen load of timber, at fifty feet per load, propper for what wee shall want hear or Cape Coast. I have cutt all.off in lenglh and squared six or seven load, and sunk a saw pitt and lined it out fitt for sawing, and gave direction s to the slaves to cutt it out in scantling,127 tilt lo be carried on board. I likewise told Capt. Piles what was best to be done with the timber and desired he would lett his carpenters mate or any one white man to see the slaves did what r ordered them aboul the timber , but he would not, and both the Captains 128 sware neither of their men should put a hand in order to getl dowoe the timber lo the sea side. Capt. Pepperell sayed he will carry but very little timber, and especially no heavy peices , he spoke of tarrying there two montbs. Capt Piles did intend to saile thence in eight or tenn dayes, but now he is vexed he must tarry for the other, and say none of his men shall help him. There is a great deale of as good timber as any upon the Coast, of two feet diamiter and downwards, but I doubt unless your worships send more slaves, and some white men to see the timber cut out according to orders, that the shipps will bring away but little, and there is enough cutt close to that which may be gott with little trouble. I have cutt the poles ordered by Capt. Piles. Capt. Pepperell desired me to acquaint your worshipps he expected a seven hand canoa, and if he have none cannot gett his wood on board his boat, for they ride at grapling 129 and cannot gett away att the Brandenburgh Castle. The slaves have no come, nor is there any to be bought in the countrey, else I had bought them some, for they cannot work without it. I came from thence a Fryday in the afternoon, it was late a Saterday night before I gott to Commenda, because of bad weather. Yesterday the raine hindred the canoa from goeing. Our masons have been to extravagant of their taITis in my absence, it is all gone and the tanck is not quite high enough to turne the arch, the bottom is not floored, therefore desire your worshipps would send downe three or four casks as soone as possible, that we may perfect it before the raines damage the walls too much. Our bricks prove very bad, they moulter away with the wett, and our masons have used parte I ordered for the arch. If a great canoa comes pray be pleased to send some well burnt. I will take care in all things committed to my charge. PS. If any goe to helpe cutt timber they will want 2 or 3 broad axes and two cross cutt saws, that all may work. Wee want the iron work I desired, especially to break stone. "

Therefore humbly desire that would be pleased to order Capt.

Therefore humbly desire that [you] would before [you] send Capt. Piles shipp of the Coast, [send it] for this place with the a:fformentioned, and a flaggsta:ff and new ffiagg, which wee much want, expecting every time these [we] have are made use of, to break downe.

But I shall endeavour to make you sincible of the contrary,and giveyou an account of a more honourable a designe than you may or are aware of, andl doubt notmay if not neglectedprovevery advantagiousto my masters the RoyallCompany in whose service I am, and should be heartily glad and as willing asanyone to venture for their advantagemy person, as far as my life and health willpcrmitt me, under God etc. In January last past it was your pleasure to send me Cheife to Guidah on thecoast ofArda, anddid alsodeliver me a letterforMr RalphHassellCheife ofAccra,which it seemes was not delivered,39 upon which neglect your Worshipthought fillto withdrawme, andto that intentdid send MrJohn Smith, to placeMr John Winder in my stead, and me returne with Mr John Smith to Cape Coast per first oppertunity of the canoe, and also did order me to deliver whatt concernes I had of U1e Royall Company: which was soone done, for haveing nothing I could deliver nothing, but only 8 damaged barrells of powder which Captain Lawrance left, because Captain Wyborne would not buy them, those they had according to your Honours com.mands. This hard dealing is enough to breake the hearts of any one, and bath been almost tile breaking of mine in this case, and doubt not but your tllougbts are as mine, for a burnt child dreads the fire. I humbly beg your pardons, Gentlemen. The letter you are all very sincible that twas particularly about my own business, twas to order Mr Ralph Hassell to take the produce of what goods I had to dispose of tllere, for account of the Company, and although I did not deliver the Jetter, neither did I on tile other hand take the least thing to the vallue of one cracra, but left all as they were. There is neither Mr Hassell nor Mr Pley, nor any one can say I did, soe that hope this may in part give your Worship some satisfaction. I should not have doubted nor have had any feare in mee but would bave gladly delivered the letter, but having a knave to deale with all and the blanketts sticking in Mr Hassells throat,40 that I could scarce gett a word from him nor a good looke, nor victualls nor drinke, that I did expect no other, butt all the ill usualls imaginable as could be owne to a man, which was the reale cause and is the truth and notiling but the truth (as God shall helpe me). Now being put out of all imployments, and having notiling to doe but walking from place to place and spending my time in idleness, which life was a burtilen to me, and being often at Cricry [var. Guidah],41 for generally there was tile most company, always one Commander or another begging of Cap.tain Wyborne his assistance to furnish them witll slaves, for goods and gold, whoe always was ready to imbrace tlleir desires with his promises in great measure, and indeed to speake the truth was commonly as good as his word, being tilere I made a very neare inquiry into all matters; and understanding that there was a place to leward called Appa from whence he gotta great many slaves, some coming by land others by sea, made me admire that men should see their own goods goeing to this place and bring slaves for the produce, when tiley might as well tilemselves send their boats and purchase them tllemselves, for I believe if a canoe may goe a boat may doe the same (I am sure their ships wil I not faile them), but they doe soe deale on this place Guidah and Ophra that they thinke slaves are not to be hand past [var. below) these places. Then tllere is imother dependence, Captain Wyborne being there they cannot faile, wboe getting their goods into his hands makes his owne advantage, a benda a head the least price for all sorts, men, women, boys and girles. That men of reason and of understanding should see themselves soe bubled,42 I am sure tis much to the disadvantage of the Royall Company and owners, I shall instance in several particulars by and by. Seeing how causes went and nothing to do, I desired the favour of Captain Wyborne that I might goe to Appa per the next canoe, which he readily granted mee, telling me the canoe would returne in 10 days, which time I thought would not be long, and knowing that Mr Smith would not goe this month, I did adventure at which place I an1 now, of which I shall give you the following account and the great advantage that may be made on all accounts whatsoever. Appa is about 30 or 40 leagues at the most from Guidah and is very remarkab le for ships to find, there being a single cocarnutt tree standing in the middle of a small bay, and a flag staff by that one [= on] which they hang up an old clout, itt makes off to sea very woody for it is a woody place, but I shall advise the Phidalgoe to make a new St Georges flagg. The Phidalgoes towne is about 3 miles from the sea, which is incompassed round with water and small riverlett issuing from the great river, and is mightily full of ba[m]boo trees which afford wine much like unto palme wyne, of which baboos they build all their houses. There is also a very famous river that goes to Boneen,43 from whence comes all sorts of cloathes and are sold cheap for any sorts of goods. Boneen is 2 dayes journey from this place per land, all goods that comes to this place are conveyed to the Phidalgoes towne by water, they having canoes of 40, 50 and 60 foot in length. There is noe need of anyones taking care of goods when ashoare as to watch them, for the people are so just that they may be trusted with unsold gold, their honesty is to admiration, and the Phidalgoe takes all the care upon himselfe. Here is good conveniency of wooding and watering just by the seaside. These people never goe to sea in their canoes, for the river being soe large and affording very much fish as mullitts and there is one sort of fish that is large as a good handsome hoge, eats much like our sturgeon and is as good in my judge.ment, for that if any vessell intends for this place they must be prov ided with a canoe and men, which said canoe may returne fraighted with Boneen cloathes (and other sorts as tJ1e place can afford, which may be much to the advantage of tl1e Royall Company my masters. It is also the chiefest markett for slaves (or the fairo as the blacks call it),44 from whence me people of Guidah and Ophra are furnisht. Assinah voulgarly called Ardau Grandy45 and other ajacent places from whence comes most slaves are ajacent to this place, soe that slaves cannot be wanting and are not, and to be bought for a more reasonable rate then either at Guidah or Ophra; of rates shall give you an account how I have seen them bought. The Phidalgoe is very desirous of a trade and also the people. Once in 15 or 20 days you shall see the river full of canoes and like unto the River of Thames, some with slaves others with clouts, others with sheap, goats, henns, others with come etc. The Phidalgoe is a very good man, and lives in great splendour and much honoured by all his people -your trade is wholly with him and noe man elce, he takeing charge of all, soe the trouble is but small. The Cappusheers are a very good honest people, very labor ious alwayes, and for the Phidalgoe or else themselves, their business is cheife ly in building, which they doe very famously and very large houses, and as for the common people they seldome or never trouble you, for they come not within the Kin gs Court, but they are generally honest, which thing is a rarity amongst them: tis not soe at Guidah, them knaves are alwayes stealing and bringing troublesome palavoras to their King, which is not here. Goods bringing from the Appraye 46 very reasonably with abun.dance of care, and delivered safe into your house. As for the base exacting of custome as Lhe King of Guidah doth demand, I doe not as yett understand that they desire any, and I shall not make enquiry for feare of putting them in mind of such an evill habuit , but I doe believe the Phidalgo e doth expect something, and also the Cabbisheers, which will not be much . I can assure your Worship this that slaves are not wanting at this place, and could the Phidalgoe have any encouragement and his people they would make it their business to turne the trade. Also the people of Assimah or Uper Arda and several! neighbouring Phidalgoes have been with me, and beg heartily that ships may come, for it is soe far for them to go 1.0Guidah, and likewise they run I.he hazard of being panjard and robed of their goods and slaves (which are all very good reasons in my opinion). And as for the injuries done to the Royall Company, I shall instance in these particulars; Captain Thomas Woodfine, Commander of the Sarah Bonadve nture, sold the 3 peices of scarlett cloath to Captain Wyborne for 9 slaves, and also 3 pieces perpenuanoes and 1 piece of say for one, which 3 pieces of scarlett cloatb I saw sold for 22 by one Cocarham, a person that belongs to Captain Wyborne, and his [= is] brother Lo Hansco, a very honest fellow, and very willingly would be imployed in the Companys serice; and also Captain John [Woodfine] of the John Bonadventure and Daniell Gates, Com.mander of the Allapeen, sold sundry pieces of silks to Captain Wyborne, they being somewhat damaged, which the other person sold as followeth , 1 piece of yellow sarcinett slite and damaged containing 48 yards. for 5 slaves, one piece of green very slite containing 37 yards. for 4, one piece ofpinke colour and 1 piece cherry containing 37 yards for 5, one piece of skie sarcinett slite but a pleasant colour and good containing 39 yards . for 5, 1 piece of flowered colour and good containing 13[.] yards47 for 2 slaves-which goods at Guidah where blowne upon and slited as if they had cost nothing, nay upon the scarlett cloath the King spit upon it, for nae booges nae slaves, without you will pay the lwice the worth of them in othergoods . Tis otherwise here, for anything goes off, booges not coveted, but good richsilkes, and all sorts of linnins, noe one sort excepted as 1know of unless il be ironbarrs, and they shall not stick ahand, neither any other thing rather then not trade,the peop le are soe willing. And having now made you sincible of my goeing to Appa and upon whataccount, which was noe other then to see what manner of place it was and what sortof people, also if that the plac e were a place for trade or not, which were my cheiefeintentions, and noe othe r ends in the least but to make the strictest enquiry aspossibly I could, that I might be capable of givei ng account of a place that may soemuch to Lhe advantage of the Royall Company, which is the truth (as God will helpme), having given U1is accounl l sha ll leave it to your wise and prudent considera.tions and sha ll remaine here untill your furUler answer and make whal inspectionpossible I can into Uletrade; and accordingly shall act and doe as you advice. [PS] I must acquaint your worship that I have had two tedious fitts of sickness sincel have been here, which have much weakened me, but I thank God am very wellrecovered, and in a good way to gaine my strength againe. The Phidalgoe was mydocter, for every day he makes me one thing or another to take, but what it was Ican never lell, also water to gargal in my mouth, and would alwayes see me takethem before he would goe . rn perusal! of yours by Mr John Smith I understand thatMr Ralph Hassell should say that the oath which I did take upon the account of theblanketts that I was forced to doe the same, but I must be so bo ld with him as to tellhim that he is a base knave and a most horrible notorious Iyer, for all the time thatI was at Accra last I scarce changed one word with him, for he would not speake to me. And likewise Mr Pley doth confi rme the same, be knowes to the contrary, butI pilty him, he dirst doe nae other wayes. For Mr Hassells part tis like him, tis the real effects of his heart and minds, also his maxims of advice to all to deny itt and confirme it with oaths, but 1would have Mr Hassell to know that I understand myselfe better then to be made a knight of the past, or to be forced to sweare upon anyaccount whatsoever. He may sweare by the eternal! God if that he pleaseth, he never bought any blanketts from Captain John How, and Mr Pley may also sweare he never had them in possession. According lo the the oath that I did take, which I didvoluntarily , I say that Ralph Hassell Chiefe of Accra did buy from Captain John How I 02 blanketts au 3a per blankett, whoe lay at anchor off Lague, Olis was the 2nd day of Octob er ([ 16]81), and brought them ashoar e and pul them into thewarehouse in Accra fort;48 which is truth as God shall help and the whole truth etc.Being at anchor at Wyamba Caplain John How came aboard Captain ThomasWoodfine49 and saluted me per Ole salutation of informer, for Mr Hassell had acquainted him how squares had gone; and I suppose delivered the blanketts back againe, for he told me that he was fully satisfied. Accounts of the rates I have seen paid for slaves at this place ApP.a Silks, 1 piece yellow, damaged, containing 48 yards . for 5 slaves; 1 piece greene contain ing 37. yards50 for 4 slaves; l piece of pink and 1 piece cherry, damaged, containing 37 yards for 4 slaves; 1 piece of good slite skye containing 39 yards. for 5 slaves; one piece flowred ditto, good , containing 13 yards. for 2 slaves. All sorts of silks sell well here, especially those that are very rich and gaudy. Sundry other sorts of goods vizt a piece of finesca:rlett cloth, 7 slaves; 12 iron barrs, l ditto; 3 cases of spiritts, 1 ditto; 2 red perpettuanos 1 ditto; 3 fine India carpetts, ditto; 6 narrow pintadoes, ditto; 4 silke allejars ditto; 12 small baftas, ditto; 4 chints, ditto. These goods I have seen bartered for slaves per Cockro and for the rates above mentioned , butt for the rates of others J cannot tell as yett, but doe presume to be all one, nay and rather cheaper, for good goods they covett much, gaudy and rich, although anything is vendible here , rather than want a trade the people are so desireous . I doe believe that Welch plaines would sell well here, by reason they make all their rich cloathes of them,51 soe that care must be had to u-ie severall sorts of colours, red, green, yellow, blew, purple and orange, and the Phidalg oe gave me a cl oath made of Welch pl aine which is very handsome. [PPS) I had neither inke nor paper but only this one sheet per chance, and am forced to write with gunpowder steeped in water, soe desire to be excused for this foule page[ ?). At the request of the Phidalgoe he desires me to write for the several! particu .lars as followeth -fine linnins of all sorts, as fine sletia:s, fine muslings, also beads of all sorts, small and great. 1 saw sold an head of beads of an gold color, transpar.ent, large the size of a white pea, this bought 1 slave. With beads, the small ones, they adorn their cloaths and make capps in the shape of a sugar loaf and adorne them as thicke as possibly they can in sundry pretty formes, which show very glorious. Your atlas silke are desired, also booges, which doe encourage much. "

Firstly: All his first comeing here from Ophra to this place, not well consider.ing the interest of your Honours in study ing and consulting the humours and dis.positions of these people, whoc will neither be slighted by a high and lofty carridgeor abused by bad language, in both of which gave too much liberty to his selfe, bywhich hee hath for ever lost the love and good will of these people, although thebreach for the present be seemingly made up, there being not one upon the placefrom the King to the poorest can afford or give him a good word.2ndly: By his becomeing debtor to one Captaine Bebc 53 for 15 slaves whichwas a long time before paid and then not to his [= Bebe's] satisfaction, I doepresume might be a great part (and by the disgust the blacks had before takenagainst him) of his being panyard, and for whatt hec may possibly say of my selfebeing concerned therein, ill was soe farr from mee that when heard itt [IJ didendeavour and partly effected the composeing of the business, and now must giveyour Honours an accompt of his suspistious asperscons cast upon mee.

Upon the 14th day of August past, here being in port an interloper calledLblank], one Fullwood Commander, whoe wanting some assistance, Captain Wy.borne not being here, Mr Winder did him what kindness lay in his power, by firstof all in paying his customes to the King , which was paid out of your Honourswarehouse in 9 lb of boogees and 9 yards of silke, which contracted the familliaritybetwixt them (things not here going to his satisfaction), that bee agreed to put 40slaves on board of him and soc leave your honours factory here, 8 of which was puton board, in which time Captain North came in hither with some goods for yourhonours account [and] the business was made up and declined.2ndly.

The 22nd came another letter fromMr John Smith to Mr Winderintemating that Captain ThomasWoodfine had altered his mind and was resolved to take in his complement of slaves at Guidah, and wished Mr Winder to neglect noe lime but come away as soon as possible mightbe.Mr Winderhaving received this letter makes all the meanesthat might be to the Phidalgoe, telling him that Mr Smith had sent for him to Guidah with an intentto withdrawthis factory, and therefore desired he might beprotected byhim, which being granted by lhe PhidalgoeMr Winder then writes to Mr Smilhlhat he was retain'd by the Phidalgoe and could not possibly come to Guidah. MrSmith sent severall letters to him to come to Guidah and at last came himself, butwas forcedto goe back without him. I asked the reason of his being soe unwillingto goe with Mr Smith, he told me Mr Smithhad a mind to keepehim at Guidah andcome to settle herehimselfe, and that he had receivedseverallabuses by whitemenatt Guidah a11dheld il not a place fttt for a factory, in regard theyhad soe raised theprices of slaves to 25 per cent dearer then they are at Ophra.66 Mr Smith notsatisffiedwith Mr Winders staying at Ophra, lhinking the Phidalgoe had kept himby forcecontrary to his owne will, wasresolvedto fetchhim away in the night, thewhichresolution he put into practice and came to Ophra in the night with a sparehammack and men arm'd, and being without sent Francis Capell to the factory toacquaintMr Winder with his designe, anddesired Mr Winder to come to him withall speed.Mr Winder haveing receivedthis messagewentalongwithFrancis Capetlto Mr Smith, and as he went acquaintedsome of the Phidalgoes people which layatthegate (asthey doe every night)thatMr Smithwascometo fetchhim to Guidah.This notice beinggiven the townewas soone up in arms, whichMr Smith found tohls cost, and seeing he could not gett Mr Winder away return'd to Guidah againeand began comake preparation to goe to Cape Coast, which after some time pro.ceeded on his voyage. He being gone Captain Shepheard arrived about the 20th ofJune in Guidah Road, and goeing on shoarc there was forc't to send for his goods,for the Blacks would not suffer him to goe on board againebefore he had began totrade with them. Captain Shepheard then sent Mr Winder your Worships letters,which haveing received [Winder] sent Robert Chapman in a canoe on board to desire Captain Shepheard to bring his ship into Ophra road, where he would beready to dochim all the servicehe could asper order fromyour Worship,but wherehe was he could not assist him in any thing, besides if he could come might do theRoyall Company great service in it, forhere was 30 slaves owing to the Companywhich would be shipt on boardhim, or if his goods should fallshortmight be madegood byiron barrs, which with his other goods would be put off and not otherwise,but Captain Shepheard being on shoare beforeMr Winders letters came could notcomply with his desires, but writthim a Jetterand sent it by Robert Chapman whowas then on board that in regard he could not comply with what Mr Winder hadwrite him of, nevertheless he would send him his remaines to Ophra if he wouldsend the said Robert Chapman for them, and withall order him to give a receipt forwhat he received, and it would be as well as if he had did it himselfe. Mr Winderhaveingreceived Captain Shepheardsletter waswillingto goe on boardof hfm, and desired me to speake lo lhe Phidalgoe for him, but when the Phidalgoe heard he wouldgoe on board a ship in Guidah road began to be doubtfull of his returne and refer'd his answer till another lime, but Mr Winder being urgent wilh the Phidalgoe made him the more distrustfull of his comeing againe, which l told Mr Winder of but he LOldme that if I could gell leave of the Phidalgoe for him, he would become bound to me in a 200 pound bond,67and likewise would give the Phidalgoe 60 slaves, that is the 30 that he owes the Royall Company and 30 more in iron, if he returned not againe but went Oil shoare at Guidah. On these considerations the Phidalgoe granted leave with my engagemenLtogether. He went Oil board and haveingbeen on board 2 dayes but the King of Guidah heard of it, and told Captain Shepheardifhe wouldbringhim on shoarehe would givehim a slave forhis pain es, the which Captain Shepheardsoone put into practice and gott him on shoare, to the great loss of the Royall Company,for as soone as this Pbidalgoe heard of it he sent for his 30 slaves in iron, which I kept him from for severalI months and told him did believeMr Winder would come againe, and had kept them yet in the factory had not Mr Armitage sold 500 bars to the French Merchant68 and he comeing to demand them the Phidalgoe said he would be paid first the 30 slaves due to him which Mr Winder contracted, and soc forc't me to pay the 30 slaves in iron. He being paid I refused to give the French Merchant the barrs Mr Armitage had sold him till further order from your Worship. I often desired Mr Winder to take some care for my departure from this place buthe put me of from time to time, and told me would waite yourWorships further order,he not findingme guilty of any thing of what was laid to my charge. The letter that came to your Worship in Andrew Crosbies name is false, he denyes it and saith he never writ any. Mr Smith and Mr Winder both questioned him about it and had his answer. When Mr Winder was gott to Guidah I often moved my willingness to be discharged and to goe home according to your Worships order. I also desired him to take some care to send booges downc to maintaine the factory,[he] have[ing] then soe many in his hands, and not let the Companys barrs be sold at soe pi ti full a price as 3 lbs of boogesper barr,69 butneitherMrWindernor Mr Armitage would give me a:nyansweare to what I wrill, thoughseverall desired, and might have had my passage in a Dutch ship if it had not been both thcire neglects.

That upon my arrivall at Ophra the 12th day ofFebuary 1681/2 I desired thePhidal goe that I might reside in his country and that he would protect me from MrSmith, whome I pretended was my enemy and would have me to Guidah; of which(he saith) I had advice before from Mr Spurvay.2ndly. That I received a letter from Mr John Smith the 22nd following wherein Iwas desired by him, to make all possible hast to Guidah, did acquaint the Phida Igoe that Mr Smith had sent for me with an intent to withdraw the factory from Ophra,and that I againe desir'd his protection, which being granted, he saith I wrote to MrSmith that I was detained by the Phidalgoc and could not possibly come to Guidah.3rdly. Being demanded by the said John Thorne , why I was so unwilling to goe with MrSmith when return'd to Guidah from Ophra, I answered Mr Smith had a mind to keepe me at Guidah, and come to settle at Ophra himselfe, that I had received severall abuses from whitemen at Guidah and that I thought it not a place fill for a factory, in regard the prices of slaves was exhaurted to 25 per cent more then at Ophra. 4thly. That Mr Smith came to Ophra in the night with a spare hammack, and being without sent Francis Capell to the factory, acquainting me with his designe and desireing me to come to him, which (he saith) I did, and as I went acquainted some of the Phidalgoes peop le therewith, whereupon the towne was up in arms and Mr Smith forct to goe without me. Sthly. That Captain Richard Shepheard being arrived at Guidah I desired John Thorne to speake to the Phidalgoe to lett me goe on board him, but he being doubtfull of my returne was unwilling to Jett me goe, upon which he saith I prof .fered him a bond of 100,71 and another to the Phidalgoe of 60 slaves to be forfeited  if I did not returne, upon which consideration leave was granted to me. 6thly. That the said John Thorne did often solicite me to take care for his departure from Ophra and that I would send him booges to maintaine the factory, and not lett the Companys barrs be sold at soe pittifull a price as 3 pound of booges, to which (he saith) I never returned him an answer. To which particulars I returne these answers: To the 1st. I acknowledge I arrived at Ophra around the time John Thorne mentions , but that I had any intention to reside there I utterly deny; neither did I ever request the Phidalgoe to protect me from Mr Smith, having no other intention but to returne to Guidah as soone as I had completed my business, and acquainted the Phidalgoe with the Agent Generalls and Councills instructions; and as to what he saith that I had notice from Mr Spurvay of Mr Smiths ill intentions towards me, I call God to wittness I never received any letter from him in my life; neither doe I remember I ever soe much as mentioned his name to John Thorne. To the 2nd. I acknowledge that I wrote to Mr Smith in answer to his of 22nd February that the PhidaJgoe did detaine me, and that I had soe great a watch over me that I could not possib ly make my escape, but that it was my owne contrivance, I againe call God to wittness, tis a most notorious lye, and I hope not to be credited; since Thorne doth attest in the 5th article, that I went on shoare at Guidah, and forfeited bonds I had given for my returne. To the 3rd. I acknowledge I did often say that I thought Ophra more convenient for the Companys factory then Guidah, by reason of the cheapness of carrying goods to the factory from the waterside was not soe great, and that slaves were to be had there at a far lower rate. As to what he saith that I told him of Mr Smiths designe to keep me at Guidah and settle himself at Ophra, I doe attest that the said John Thorne did endeavour to perswade me Mr Smith bad such a designe, which I never credited, knowing he did it on purpose, to alienate my affections from the said MrSmith. 72To the 4th. l can safely take my corporall oath, that when I went out oftlle factoryto Mr SmiUl, I did it with as real a designe to make my escape with him to Guidahas ever I did any thing in my life, and might have gon away had not Thorne sent theBlacks to panyare us. To the 5th. I acknowledge il true, and that I did give a bond of l 00 to John Thorneand of 30 Slaves to the Phidalgoe for my returne to Ophra, without which I couldnot possibly escape, and here I des ire John Thornes roguery may be taken noticeof, for ifhe had noe designe to prevent my goeing away, why did be make me givehim a bond to assure him of my returne.To the 6th. I confess rnever sent John Thorne any booges, it being contrary to myorders to send any goods or any person there till he was gon off. "

I am most heartily sorry 1 am Foret to give you account of theunhappy misfortune befaJlen the Royall Company by Captain Lowe and Woolli.fords ships being taken, as also per the loss of the Blessing. I shall forbeare totrouble you with every particular circumstance hereof, because itt is largely ex.press'd in the inclosed from Cap tain Lowe to theAgent, 73 and only acquaint you inthe gcnerall that the 16th ultimo in the evening the two pyrates mentioned in yourletter of the 12th ditto came downe to this roade, and tooke Captain Lowe, whoemade some smaJI resistance. Captain Rickards people cult their cable and went outof the roade, but before the ship came ashoare tooke the gold out and left her, which[ship] is lost, and not anything saved out of her. The mens intent was to run awaywith the gold, in order whereunto they gott aboard the Dutchmen in Ophra roade,but by U1e endeavour of Captain Rickard and myselfe and some small matter giventhe Phidalgoe for his assistance (whoe I must needs say was verry helpfuH to us)part of itt is recovered, and one bulse containing 28 marks, 3 ounces and 7 anglessent the Royall Company by Captain Woolliford. The rest Captain Rickards hascarried with him in the Merchants Bon adventure, whoe departed this roade 5 dayessince. Captai n WooJlifords men left the ship, which the pyrates tooke the next morning with all the gold in her, they pretended they would have fought but that 12 of their guns were in the hould, which was the occasion of their flight.74 Perhaps ill may be immagined that itt was my fault hee was not gon off with his complement before, but I call God to wittness I did my utmost endeavour, as Captain Lowe and Rickard will justifie to the Royall Company, and doe affirme that would hee have been ruled by mee hee might have been dispatcht. Att my arrival! with him, I found the trade much altered in my absence, the people craveing to have the measure for booges altered, and the price of slaves in many goods to be advanc'd, which I refused to doe, ill being your express order to depress the price, and not to advance itt,75 by which meanes I bought but SOslaves in 3 weekes, but when I had brought the _people to their former customes and they were content to sell their slaves att the old rate, Captain Woolliford came ashoare, and in a great passion tooke the business out ofmy hands76 and immediatly chang'd the measure and brought up a custome of shakeing itt, whereby ilt is become neare 90 pounds, and farther gave 3 fine sletias and halfe, which was never before more then 3, the like in allejars halfe a peece more then usuall,77 whereupon I demanded the cargoe ashoare which you were pleased to consigne mee per bill of loading, but in the presence of Captain Lowe and Captain Rickard, hee absolutely refused to deliver itt to mee, saying that haveing possession hee had 11 points of the law, and that hee would make use of that pa.rt of itt which was most ready to buy Negroes, the rest bee would deliver mee when hee had his complement, since which the pyrates came downe, by whome he says he was plundered and the goods lost, though I can prove that pa.rt of the ca.rgoe consign'd to mee was sent to windward in his boate without my approval!, which was sunk per the pyrates, and for anything I know, might be a greate occasion the ships were taken, for the people in the boate inform'd the pyrates in what posture the ships lay, with their yards and topmasts downe, and many of their men on shoare. 1 have acquainted the Royall Company all large herewith78and have given them cop pie of his bill of loading for the goods, with bills of lioading for the slaves bee said he had aboard, and those aboard Captain Lowe, the same you will receive enclosed, and have likewise sent others to the Royall Companys factors in the West lndias according to your order. I found Mr Armitage ready and willing to comply with your order in all things, and doubt not would have been verry helpefull to mee had hee lived, hee departed this life the LSthultimo, baveing laine sick above 10 days, and by mee and others often advised to settle his estate, and make up his accounts with the Company, which hee neglected to doe, however after his decease in the presence of scverall English men, I inventory'dwhat concerns of his was in the factory, and have taken itt into my possessio n, ofwhich the Roy all Company and his freinds in England shall have a just accompt. [have now no person with mee whom I dare trust (excep t William Belwood), have.ing sent Mr Still to Ophra, and the rest that came downe with mee rfind to be suchsottish fellowes, that I dare not be out of the fact0ry an houre unless I leave Belwoodatt home, for which reason I most humbley intreate your favourable constructionfor my non complyance with your order in sending him up, for I ca n at present aswell spare my right hand as him. Captain Quow hath been au Ophra, being orderedby mee to proceed according to your instruction, hee will give you an account ofthe Phidalgo's answer to his pallavora. I likewise desired Captain Rickard to ac.quaint him with every circumstance of your order, and hee tells me that the PhidaJ.goe replyed that the first ship of the Companys that goes thither shall hav e Thorneaboard, provided they will carry him to England and not to Cabo Corsoe, and thathce will comply with all your demands whensoever the Company begins to con.tinue their trade with him. Ifl might advise, I think ill would not bee amiss to order one ship thither for tryall, and accordingly tbe Royall Company may pr oceed withthese people. Mr Windover continues still at Appa about 15 leagues to leward ofthis place.79 I have informed Captain Wyborne according to your order. that hee [=Wendover] is considerab ly in the Companys debt and that ifhedetaines him itt willbe att his own perrill, to which hee returned that hee was not anywise imployed byhim, and promised mee to use his endeavour to gett him heither, when he doth Ishall comply with your order in sending him to Cabo Corsoe. The present you werepleased to send the King of Guydal1 was thankfully received per him, with many promises of continuing a faire correspondence with the Royall Company, but ifmasters of ships have liberty to give what they please for their slaves and spoyletrade au their pleasure, the endeavours of the factors they have will be frustrate,and this place in short time of noe advantage to them. Andrew Crosbie went off inCaptain Churchey, and Robert Chapman is dead. Captain Wyburne is lately re.turned from a place called Abree, about 16leagues to windward of Guydah , where hee hath been about 6 weekcs buying slaves for Captain Booth, an interloper. 80 Iunderstand iu is a good place for slaves, and doe know that Wyburne intends to settle a Whiteman there, but had I your order I would prevent him, or au leastwise share the trade of that place by hoysting a flagg there for the Royall Company. The cheife goods they covett are booges, tapsells, allejars and pintado's. I have enclosed return 'd your letter to Captain Waugh, who was gon off the coast before the pyrates came downe. I heare he gotthis slaves att Quitto, a place about 5 leagues to leward of the River ofVallta. 82 Hee came not downe to Guydah, but I am credibly inform'd hee sent mee a letter which Captain Woolliford intercepted and never came to my hands, soe can give you noe further accoun t of him. Captain Lumley arrived here two dayes since, whoe I doubt not may have his comp lement in 10 dayes, he givei ng the same rates that others have don before him, without whic h nothing is to be don, unless these people see that wee can send our ships to Ophra. Had I a good supply of booges, I might probablely, when ships are absent, bring them to the old rate, and I am sure, could in 10 dayes time, noe sh ips being here, purchase a good parcell of slaves for the next ship that came . The goods most in request att present are booges, corrall, white baftas, broad pintado 's, white ground, allejars, sletias, white pautkaes, and brass panns. If your Worship would be pleased to entrust me with a small parcel! of each, itt shaJI be my greate cMe to imploy them to the utmost advantage of the Royall Compa ny, and desire that I may have a proportionable part in booges, for without halfe in halfe noe slaves are to be had, and I doe hereby reiterate the promise I made to you att Cabo Corsoe of being faithfu l\ to my masters and not to convert their stock to the use of interlopers. 495 . Petly Wyborne Guydah, 26 June 1683 Yom letters of the 30th December and 23d March I have received, which binds me soe much to serve you that I shall never be able to performe my duty, but will to my power. l have never refused the Companys service nor I never will, but truely without a verry great loss I cannot leave this place in a little time, not soe soon as to have oppertunily to waite upon you au Cabo Corsoe before you goe, if you goe when your first three yeares is out. In what I can be serviceable to the Company here, I will and doe itt faithfully, The Dutch are seUeing a factory att Popoe, which they have had formerly, ill is 8 leagues from this place.83 I have an acquaintance about 8 leagues to windward of itt.84 The cheife people have obliged themselves to mee, I know itt is a place that in a short time would be verry convenient for the Company, being well managed, there is noe gold but there is aggree85 and slaves, come always is plenty; I have some trade with them, I send from Guydah to this place by river.86 If I can serve the Company in setUeing a factory for them and you are pleased to send a quallified man or two for that purpose, I will not question the doeing of itt. I question not but I could send you a letter to Accra wilhin land. Mr Winder shall want nothing I can serve him in. I trouble you 110t with account of pyrates because he tells me hee doth. "

Some small time after they were out of the gate they sent for me to render thanks for the same, and as it was their new year all Chiefs did use to drink with them. Not in the least imagining they had any design or prejudice of ill against me, I did go out. I had not gone six yards from the Castle wall without the gates but presently unsuspectedly a great number of Blacks interveened me and the gate on purpose to hinder mee from returning again, as I since found true. I then went to the Cappusheers, which satt under the wall about 7 or 8 yards farther, they desired me to sitt down, which I did, then they began long storyes, saying that at my going there I promised to be kind to them. I replyed, I never was otherwise. They answered that I would not take cracra mony as others had done before me, and that I would take no pawnes nor trnst them, 70 and that the English men were not so kind to them as the Dutch, for that wee [i.e. English] all loved the Fetuers better than the Ffanteeners, and that the Ffetuers were their enemyes, and that they [i.e. the English] might be better aided at Cabo Corso than at Anamaboe, and that J should not tarry there no longer; to which Jmade this answer, that I had orders not to take their cracra mony, it was so bad, and if I should take it it would occasion more bad mony to be made and brought to me, which I must make good, and that it behooved me to take none but what was good, and what others had done should not be a president for me. I told them likewise that I could not take pawns, knowing that they do not care to redeem them , and that for severa!l years Mr Thelwall had pawnes from severall of them and that time the Royall Companyes mony lay dead, and so they would do again ifl took any pawnes , and as for trusting of them I had to my losse done to much, which I have made good to the Royall Company, and as to the Dutch loving them better than the English, replyed they bad more reason for they were ever treacherous to us, as instance their selling Conuantine from us to the Dutch, 71 and as for being more kind to the Fetuers, though their enemyes, [they] were more faithfull ever than they, yett for their mony they might be supplyed as as well as they , for they have nothing without money , and what had I done that should so much incense them to that height. They still persisted in the same story, and that I should not go into the Castle again but I should instantly go to Cabo Corso, and that they would strip me naked and beat me as they had Mr Nightingale, unlesse I would send for an anchor ofrume. I well knowing that their crue lty infinitely transcends humane apprehensions, condescended to save myself impunified, and that I might go into the Castle again, which they would not permitt unlesse I left Mr Walker behind me as a pawn and that severall of them might enter with me. This was all done under the Castle walls where no damage could be done to them by any gunns, the fort being so ill contrived and so weakly manned that they esteemed it invallid. This I humbly offer to your consideracons and will averr to be truth, which is the only reason of my returning to Cabo Corso.

The admirall clapt our ship aboard and after fireing many broad sides and valleys of small shott supprized our ship, the slaves on the deck 150 and my caske to c1eare my hold. Come with the King's jack, ensigne and pennant, wounded 7 of my men, although they made no resistance. Entered 150 men. My mate cutt the cable, upon which hee cutt his and then laid her aboard upon the luff, att which time my people yeilded the ship. Captain Rickards his people cutt their cable and loosed the fore topsaile and put to the shoare, but before shee came ashoare, quited the ship, tooke out the gold and lett the ship and slaves drive ashoare, the which is lost and not one thing saved out of her. Captai n Woollifords men quited their ship and left their gold aboard, the which the pyrates found all the next morning and an English woeman and the cooke. Att this action Captain Rickards, Woolliford and my selfe in the country purchaseing our slaves, which Woolliford might have had his slaves long before but much disobliged the blacks, though hee raised the price of booges att least IO pounds in a slave, and told the Blacks that I was comeing downe which made them keepe their slaves for mee, which I had 150 aboard and 150 ashoare, but not goods ashoare to pay for them, and I was to be dispatcht in 9 dayes more had this not happened , but now my ship is soe much disabled that I feare shall hardly carry her to the lndias, all my low masts shott, soe that all the fishes and provisions I can make will hardly hould, all but 3 shrouds on one mast and 5 on the other gon, my foremast shott; [they have] taken all my sailes, good provisions, cordage, arrnes and powder with aJI my cl oaths, gold and what was proper for them as they thought of the Company goods, as allejars, chercolees, pintado's, attlases, muzlin; and what booges on my deck and in my boate to goe ashoare, which was 6 caske, [they) throwes overboard. The next day they seized all my officers to the gunnell to shoote to death to confess for more gold, but only shott my gunners mate to death, and the other which was prevented by the English pyrates that was aboard, otherwise all the rest had dyed. Captain Rickards hath used much dilligence in looking after his gold, which was carried by his men and boate to Ofra aboard the Flemings, but broake open and greate part of itt divided amongst them, and on the news to the Flemings two of them weighed and most of his men gon with them. Hee hath gotten part of it againe and 28 marks sent home to the Company per Captain Woolliford, who sailed 2 dayes since. I have now 423 slaves on board on the Companys account and 25 on my mens account , for when the pyrate had quited the ship and had watered his ship out of her, my men desired him to give them something towards their loss , upon which bee gave them my ship, goods and slaves for their owne proper use, and ordered them that if I agreed to itt they should fire 7 gunns, if not att 8 the next morning hee would come aboard and burne her, upon which the next morning they demanded my ship, goods and slaves and to gett her to St Thoma and sell her and divide the money. I answered that itt was not in my power to give nor theirs to receive, but if they would goe about their business and refitt the ship I would find out some way to consider their loss, upon which I told them I would gett creditor for 25 slaves and send for the Factor off, whoe should allow itt and give the Company an account , and that I beleeved 25 slaves would make good all their, loss and desired them to consider whether or noe that was not a safer way, then to be like the pyrates , upon which after many disputes they fired 7 guns, and after the man of warr weighed after haveing been here 4 dayes, soe that I sent for Mr Winder aboard and satisfied him of the thing and hee told them hee would assist them with a letter to the Company to that purpose, upon which they went to worke and in 12 day's time I gott my ship in a pretty good condition and went ashoare againe. In which time Captain Woolliford bought all his slaves but how many I cannot tell. His ship was only taken by 3 prisoners which the pyrate sent aboard and brought the White woeman and the cooke and all the gold aboard. Hee saith hee hath Jost greate quantity of goods, but I am sure he hath much abused Mr Winder and pretends all that goods that you sent downe to his factory is lost, and had not Captain Rickards and my brother Woolman left him [= Winder] something could not have supported. Hee hath been veny dilligent in getting part of Captain Rickards gold and my slaves, and now recovered of his sickness very serviceable to the Company. The people of this place are verry kind to him and hee obliges them well, but itt is my opinion that if you doe not send for the time forward as many ships to Ophra as this place the Companys trade will be spoyled, for after our loss when wee brought the remaines of goods ashoare the blacks plundered as well as the pyrates and could gett no satisfaction of them, and the people of Ophra att this time doe promise that if you will send ships there wee shall have a good trade, and I well know there the prizes are settled and 20 per cent less then here, for they grow upon every ship here, soe that if you think convenient to Jett Mr Winder goe there and order a seacond or more to that factory and 2 or 3 to this, the two places will strive to outvey the one the other. Your advice to us came 12 houres after our ships was taken, and they stayed by the way att a place called Abrew, some 18 leagues to windward of this place, where Captain Wyborne was getting of slaves for Captain Booth, 103 and that they went on board Captain Booths ship, which gave the pyrate notice that they were a canoe for advice , upon which the pyrate weighed after them and outsailed, otherwise might have had 24 houres notice, for itt was the 17th day of May they came down and your letter of 5 dayes date. If my brother Thompson and brother Collins be with you pray remember my love to them and tell them I would have them goe home, for their ship and goods is given to the merchant of the greate Fleming the pyrate tooke, and about 2,000 pounds worth of goods more, and that the merchant promis'd mee to goe for Holland and that he would send the ship and her concerns for England to the owners.

I thinking noe harme went ashoare with 3 men more, they treaded mee kindly att the first, but after I had been ashoare about 2 hourse, att my comeing away they panyard mee and all the men and beate and cutt us verry much , wee all looking for nothing but death. After a small time [we asked] why they did soe, they answered that they must have all my slaves and goods, 109 and that an English ship had been there and burnt their towne and kill'd 2 men and carryed off 13 more. I told them that the goods were none of mine and that I could not give them away, but I seeing that here was about a l 00 people upon the island that was come over from the maine in a small time, fear'd that they would goe and take the vessell, there being noe more then my mate and one man and a boy aboard . I sent for the slaves and 40 iron barrs and a bunch of beades, but I haveing neither pen nor paper my mate mistooke and seat a chest of beades. After these goods were ashoare, for when they came first aboard I shewed them all my goods, they would have my powder and musketts, kettles, pintado's, booges, soe I sent for 10 kettles, 10 pintado's, 30 musketts, barrell of powder, 3 plaines. After this they would have all the teeth that I bought of them and wax and severall other small things , and after they had kept mee 24 houres, they Jett mee goe. I staid three dayes att the rivers mouth to see if I could gettany Negro's off there, but could not. The 21st ditto I came to an anchor att Cape Lopas, where I found my brother Lowe, Captain Booth and Captain Howe and a Fleming bound for Angola to take in 500 slaves. My brother and Captain Rickards was verry well but has mett with a greate mortallity with his slaves. The 23rd ditto my brother sailed. There is noe trade, for the Negro's sayes that here has been 30 or 40 saile of ships within this 3 months .110 They told mee that the privateere were here 6 weeks past with 7 saile in company with him. The 25th ditto there came one Captain Serjant that came out of the Bite, and he inform'd mee that Captain Davis was dead and a greate many of his men, and that hee had but 50 slaves in when hee came away. This Serjant is an interloper and was panyard att the Gabboones 9 dayes before mee, and that they made him pay to the vallue of 150 pounds in teeth and goods , before they lett him goe, upon which Captain How and I agreed to goe downe againe to see if I could recover satisfaction. The 26th wee sailed and mett Capta in Clarke, but wee put him to a greate deale of charge, for hee tooke us to be the pyrate . Captain Thompson has tooke his passage upon Captain Howe. The 22nd [sic] ditto I came to an anchor att the rivers mouth and went up the river in Captain Howe. The 30th ditto the Prince and about 30 people more came aboard, and after they had been a small time aboard I came in sight and wee panyard the Prince and 8 men more and killed and wounded 10, and the rest leap'd over board. We kept then 6 dayes and I have gott all my owne slaves and part of my goods, but could not possibly gett all by reason of itt's being distributed up in the country, but I have gott 4 slaves and 160 weight of teeth besides my own teeth for the goods and wee lett the Prince and 2 more goe. The 11th of August I came to an anchor att Cape Lopas againe, where I found Captain Lumley's pink, but hee has been dead this 15 dayes. They have a parcell of verry good slaves and has buried but 2 since they came off the coast. The 13th ditto waid againe and the 17th ditto came unto St Thoma, where Captain How and I was clapt in prison under the pretence of our selling goods and not paying the Kings custome, but I understand better since, for they would force Captain Howe to take his provisions of the Govemour and Captain and att what price they would, but I was quickly Jett out againe, but Captain Howe they made him come to their price. Since I have been here I understand there has been 2 Portugeeze taken at the Gabboones after the same manner as I was, one had 60 slaves and the other 9 and they tooke all from them both and then lett them goe. I hope to find a better trade att Sherbera 111 to make up my loss time. for neither att the Gabboones nor Cape Lopas is there any trade, soe I hope your honour will not think ill of [me]. [PS] Th.is day I think for to saile.
