1,1,1,James Parris,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,25/03/1683,Fort,RAC,"These are to give you an account of our affaires here. Att our first comeing the Addoomes ordered us to bring our flagg and staff on shoare the which wee did, and on the sand the Dutch sent all his people and slaves and tooke our staff from us and kept itt: soe I went on board the briganteen and rideing att anchor here in the roade on the 23rd day being Monday att 11 of the clock att night the Addoomes came on board with two small canoes for to have us come on shoare againe with our flagg whereupon Coffee and Thomas Hendrick went on shoare to see what all the people did say, whereupon Thomas Hendrick came on board againe and told us that all the business was ended and to bring the flagg on shoare againe and hoyst itt and all was well, but the Dutch was much troubled and carryed some of his goods downe to the waterside to begon, and this townes Cabosheers haveing taken a fittish to be true to the Dutch from the Generall of the Mina, the Dutch factor fell out with them about hoysting our flagg here and sent for the Addoomes and proffered them what they would demand to take our flagg downe, but the Adoomes would not hearken to them, for they would have the English to live here, whereupon the Adoomes demanded of us 3 perpettuanoes, 4 sheets, 1 carbine and 1 paper brawle, the which Mr Shears sent on shoare and I have them now in my custody. The Dutch fiscall is comeing up hither to put us away and this townes Cabosheers are soe much affraid of the Dutch's displeasure that they have ordered us to begon. The Addoomes are goeing into the country and tells these Cabosheers that except the English lives here they will come immediatly and destroy them againe. Mr Shears hath been att a greate charge in liquors here in goeing to and fro and hoy sting the flagg and now as I was wrighting they have pulled downe our flagg staff and I expect to goe aboard againe this day. They tell mee now they have orders from the Mina to pull downe our staff."
2,1,2,Mark Bedford Whiting,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,12/06/1683,Fort,RAC,"This is only to give your Worship an accompt that with the helpe of Mr Sheares I was by the natives wellcom'd on shoare and have gotten free possession of the Roy all Company s factory, but the Dutch [are] shamefully turn'd out of doores, being not lookt upon, all the Blacks promiseing to be true and honest to the English, hopeing they will build a fort with a few gunns and [saying] that wee shall not want trade. Here is a great man come from Tickadoe the King of the Addoomes, whoe is goeing tomorrow to him to give him an account of my settlement here, whoe was sent downe for that purpose. Wee are now in want of blew perpettuanoes, sheets, powder and carbines and severall other goods as brandy, wee haveing expended the most part of that I brought, in dashey's and makeing pallavora's, as Captain Shears and Coffee can give you an account, but some dashey's are yett wanting for the King of the Addoomes and Captain Asshume which I hope your Worship will furnish them suddenly. As for goods I have according to order gotten some of Captain Sheares, as your Worship may see per receipt, and have disposed of some to the vallue of 6 ounces. I hope here will be a good trade, nothing shall be wanting by mee to increase the same."
3,1,3,Mark Bedford Whiting,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,20/06/1683,Fort,RAC,"Since my last to your Worship here are come downe some of the Addoomes whoe are in want of goods as beads yallow, and corrall, perpettuanoes blew, knives, small basons and small brass panns, Welch plaines, blew and greene, but more especially narrow niccanees and tapsells, as alsoe powder which is a great commodity here and much inquired for by the said people, whoe hath promised to stay untill Munday for said goods and would faine speake with Captain Coffee from Tickadoe the King; I would that your Worship would send him up hither by all meanes. Here is money come downe but noe goods as they want. Wee have now taken betwixt 4 and 5 marks, I doe not question a good trade. I must alsoe informe your Worship of our small house here and by noe means wee cannot with safety secure the Companys goods, but am forct to watch them night and day. I confess the houses are all alike, only [= except] the Dutch house, whoe still are here. Captain Sheares promis'd to speake to your Worship for a scarlett cloath for Captain Asshume whoe makes much enquiry for [it], as alsoe a hatt which you may send up with the goods. The Dutch att Tagarada sent their canoe this day to the Mina for sheets and beades which vends much att this place. I would wright your Worship oftener only am in want of a canoe and to hyre a canoe every time is chargable, the Dutch have them here for that purpose. Pray faile not to supply us that the Adooomes may have noe cause to complaine, I give them all the encouragement immaginable."
4,1,4,Mark Bedford Whiting,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,26/06/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships of the 25th instant is come to hand by Captain Coffee, as alsoe the 9 hand canoe, by which I have received the goods mentioned in the said letter, there being 3 pieces of Welch plaines damnified, haveing 6 or 7 wholes apeece in them. Your Worship hath risen the prizes of all sorts of goods [so] that I can in noe wayes sell them att those rates, but as formerly sold by Mr Sheares as on the other side appeares. I could have taken 2 marks of gold more this day if not risen. Wee are in great want of powder and was in hopes to have been supply'd by this canoe, the people are soe greedy for itt that they have intrusted mee with 3 marks of gold for the same and would not lett me alone till I had dispatcht the canoe for the same. Here is money for 100 barrells in the towne I beleeve, therefore upon receipt hereof I would have your Worship dispatch the canoe up heither with the same for I understand that there is a ship at Dickiscove, and I would not willingly lett slip soe good an oppertunity, for they will all be runing aboard, they have promised to stay untill Fryday morning and noe longer. Your Worship needs not question but that the powder will be safe here, for I feare itt will be taken all away att the waterside, and what is not wee can safely secure itt from any danger. Your Worship may send halfe barrells and some whole barrells, as alsoe some sheets and Guyney clouts and alsoe pautkaes blew, and scarlett cloath and blew. The Dutch canoe passed by this place for Tagarada with goods for that place as beades, sheets, perpetuano's and brandy, but noe powder. They sell their green perpetuano's at 10a and blewes att 9a, brandy att 1a per gallon. Your Worships perpettuanoes that you sent will not hold up with the greens, there being as many more greens and [sic: = than?] blews. Tickadoe the King hath sent some of his people to Coffee for a hatt and a chayre they desireing to have itt sent up heither that they may carry itt up with them in the country. Coffee tells mee that Griffin att Cape Coast can supply him with a chayre, but where to gett a hatt I cannot tell. The Dutchman is still here, haveing noe goods only brandy and a few beades, as for brandy wee shall want for next Tuseday is the time of their danceing here and according to contract made wee are to give the Cabasheers of this towne a perpetuanoe and one broad tapsell which wee have not here, as alsoe 2 halfe ankors of brandy. I beleeve that snap pans is a great commodyty here, for the people of this place runs as far as Accoda to the Brandenburgs to buy them, whoe sells them att 5 angles a peece. I am glad your Worship will provide us a 5 hand canoe which wee want here much, there being scarcity of canoes att this place, I would have your Worship send her up alsoe by the canoe. I have according to order sent your Worship by David March what gold was in cash on account of the Royall Affrican Company and shall alsoe send itt by all safe conveyance; I now send you 7 marks, I hope to make itt 7 more before the month is out. He doe my endeavour, but powder is the thing which I would have your Worship send up by all meanes without delay and dispatch the canoe as soone as arrived unless others come and take all the money. Wee expect ships every day to trade here there being two to windward.

[PS] Since my wrighting this letter the Addoomes and Wassaers mett together before the factory being about a hundred in company there, they made a greate pallavora, Coffee and I being sent for by them, saying that unless your Worship would abate the prizes of goods they would goe to Dickiscove or to the Dutch att Tagarada and lay out their money, wondering why the goods should be risen of a sudden and not sold att Mr Shears rates or as on board the Companys ships. Their prizes is this, they will give but 4a for tapsells narrow and 4a for niccanees, alsoe 9a for green perpetuano's and 10a for blews, 2 lb basons 9 for 8a and 4 lb ditto 1a, Guyney clouts 7 for 8a, paper brawles att 2a each, sletias course 4a, tallow 3a the halfe firkin, powder 1 ounce and , sayes att 15 angles, blew pautkaes 1a.

Pray faile not to send us word wheither your Worship pleases to alter the prizes, for they will not sell att those rates before mentioned, and this is all but what they urged mee to wright your Worship, alsoe not forgetting Tickado's hatt and chayre and powder allsoe. If your Worship could spare us a hammer and a saw wee could secure the house better for wee want some tooles."
5,1,5,Mark Bedford Whiting,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,27/06/1683,Fort,RAC,"Just now arrived a canoe from Axim whoe informed us and the Dutch Copeman here that yesterday night arrived att the said place a French pyrate whoe forct two ships under the protection of that fort. This serves only to give your Worship advice [so] that Mr Sheares may not venture up heither. This is certainely true. The Dutch I beleeve will give your Worship noe advice therefore [I] could not trust to them, allthough they sent advice to the Mina. Pray faile not to send us more niccanees narrow but powder especially and dispatch this canoe up heither with the 9 hand canoe immediatly upon receipt hereof.
[PS] Pray fayle not to send us a chayre and a hatt for Tickadoe for the people are verry urgent to be gon, as alsoe Captain Assumes cloath and hatt not forgetting powder."
6,1,6,Mark Bedford Whiting,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,30/06/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships of the 28th instant I have per the 9 hand canoe with the goods mentioned in the letter, wherein your Worship wrights as to the prizes of goods. I shall observe your Worships orders as to that matter although I cannot sell them all, att the Castles rates, here being an interloper one Captain Parris of Barbado's that undersells mee in some sorts of goods, as tallow att 3 angles the halfe firkin and other goods which hee sells att lower rates, which att present am not sencible of itt. I wrote your Worship per the 9 hand canoe for more sheets and niccanees, but received none, I have but one chest and halfe left and some of them are damnified and a parcell of sayes which came out of Mr Sheares his ship, which I feare [I] must sell by the fathom to the best advantage. The small tapsells will not vend at 5 angles, but att 4 angles as the niccanees, which goes well att that price, but the tapsells I have not sold one. Yours of [= by] John Downes is come to hand, I have accordingly sent a canoe to Dickiscove aboard of a Dutch interloper, one skeeper Johnson, whoe I am inform'd can give intelligence of the pyrate, att the returne of the canoe I shall according to order send her downe to your Worship. The said interloper sells abundance of sheets and snap pans. I inquired on board of Captain Parris whether hee saw any ships to windward, whoe tells mee noe, only spoke with the said interloper att Dickiscove whoe said nothing to him of any pyrate. Captain Parris informes mee that Captain Nurse was safe arrived att Barbado's when hee came thence which is about 5 months, alsoe Captain North whoe went thence to Jamaica. Captain Attwell run 40 slaves ashoare upon his own account att Barbado's and some of his men inform'd against him, and when hee was examined hee confessed the thing, soe they multed him; his gunner is aboard of the said Parris whoe left the ship att Barbado's, [he] and severall others they lost all their wages. The scarlett cloath and hatt for Captain Asshume is delivered him whoe is well satisfied and thanks your Worship. Wee shall take care to send the carpett, chayre and hatt for Tickadoe when any of his people comes downe. I have disposed of the best part of the powder, itt will not be long before the other goes off. These interlopers have done mee a little injury, they being here before the canoe came up. I am glad your Worship will send us a 2 hand canoe itt being a thing necessary att this place."
7,1,7,Mark Bedford Whiting,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,02/07/1683,Fort,RAC,"This is to acquaint your Worship that just now arrived the Dutch interloper from Dickiscove here and accordingly I sent a canoe on board to enquire of the pyrate, and hee writt mee word that there is one to windward of 40 gunns, whoe [he] beleeves itt is Van Home, hee cannot justly tell. The said interloper was chased by him from Ashinee to Axim, where hee left him, and went up to windward againe, and his intent is to stay a little to windward of Ashinee, and take ships as they come downe. Here is a Companys ship att Dickiscove, whoe I beleeve is Captain Phenney in a small ship, I am informed hee was never upon the coast before. The Dutch interloper spoke with him yesterday night, and desired him not to stay there, but to goe downe to Cabo Corsoe. Here the ships are ready for a fight. The Companys ship intends to wood and water att Dickiscove, shee past by Ashinee in the night and soe [I] beleeve escap'd the pyrate. This interloper hath been 7 months out of Holland. The other pyrate that went downe last, chased alsoe this man att Cestus. Hee tells that Van Horns stearmen is aboard of that pyrate that went to leward and alsoe that Van Home will take all nations. Here the Dutch interloper sells sheets 30 per bendy and snap pans 8 per bendy, tallow 3 angles per [half?] firkin. I must expect to sell nothing as long as they lye here."
8,1,8,Mark Bedford Whiting,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,09/07/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships letter per the 9 hand canoe is come to hand with 130 sheets, and 240 niccanees narrow, the niccanees are farr worse then those your Worship sent before, they being the same sort I had from Mr Sheares and doubt will not sell soe well; I have accordingly sent your Worship the tapsells narrow as per your order haveing sold but two att 5a, they will not give 5 for them, and severall other goods, which are now remaining here which alsoe will not vend att the Castles rate, as you shall perceive per accompt as soone as the month is out, then [I] doe intend to send James [Parris] that the docter may survey his legg, whoe will give your worship an accompt how affaires stands here. Captain Draper arrived here yesterday with another Dutch interloper whoe still affirmes of a pyrate to windward, but [I] beleeve [it] is a lye. Your Worship cannot expect any trade ashoare as long as they lye here. I am inform'd by the Blacks that before your Worship sent downe your letter to Captain Draper that hee sold his powder att lo 4a per barrell, sheets att la per piece, boy sado's att 18a, knives att 1a per douzen. I have according to your Worships order sent per David March 5 marks of gold."

Your Worship promised mee to send us a canoe which wee cannot have here some times for love nor money to goe to Cabo Corsoe, itt is one of the best things wee can have here to give your Worship advice of any thing that should happen. I received a letter yesterday from Captain Bell whoe desired mee to send him the prizes of goods as sould in the Castle which I did accordingly. Captain Phenney past by yesterday, Captain Draper is still here, I have not disposed of any goods since these ships arrivall. I now send your Worship 2 ounces, 7 angles and 9 tacco's of gold and 11 marks, 7 ounces, 7 angles and 6 tacco's sent before, makes 12 marks, 1 ounce, 15 angles and 3 tacco's which is the ballance of my accompt."
10,1,10,Mark Bedford Whiting,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,27/07/1683,Fort,RAC,"This accompany's Captain Coffee whoe is sent up by the Cabasheers of this place to informe your Worship that the Addooms and Ayampama the King of the Aquiffa's will come downe to fight this people. The Generall of the Mina I am inform'd hath sent a greate dashey to the said Ayampama to rout the English out here. Itt is the Cabasheers desire that your Worship would be pleased to send some body to this Ayampama and another to the King of Greate Commenda to know the pallavora. The Dutch Copeman is goeing hence tomorrow, alsoe the other from Tagarada, the Generall haveing sent two greate canoes with their fiscall to take their goods away, which I am glad of itt, itt will be the better for us. The Cabasheers desire your Worship that you'l be pleased now to keepe possession to yourselfe for they are resolv'd to entertaine noe more Dutch att this place. Here is arrived Captain Doegood a Companys ship, alsoe a Danes ship from St Thoma, whoe hath a letter from Captain Waugh who went from that place with the white woeman [var. woemen], two day's before this mans departure thence. Noe news of Captain Manlow. I have not taken one farthing since these ships arrivall. I now send your Worship per Captain Coffee 2 marks of gold on accompt of the Royall Company.
The money for the brandy I shall send att the months end with my accompt. I hope now to have a better trade, for could not dispose of one sheet of late, the Dutch att Tagarada selling 32 per bendy, and beades 7 pounds for 4 angles. I have not sold any as yett but [they are] often enquired for. I want more powder, I have sold all only one barrell remaining. Pray dispatch Captain Coffee up hither as soone as possible."

This accompanys James Parris, whome I have sent downe to your Worship for some more goods now the country people being come downe, the goods they demand is powder and sheets, and boysado's, wee have none of those sort of goods to supply them. Your Worship needs not question the powder but safe, I doubt itt will not stay long in the factory. Here is now a good trade, and doe not question but that itt will continue soe if shiping doe not come here soe fast one after another. Yesterday came here the greate Cabasheer of Tagarada to desire your Worship to settle there, and that noe Dutch should ever be entertained att that place noe more. I now send your Worship 4 marks of gold. Pray faile not to supply us with the aforesaid goods as soone as possible alsoe with some silke longees."

As to powder I humbley begg, that your Worship would spare us a douzen barrells itt being for Tickadoe, hee haveing sent his man here 10 dayes agoe for that purpose and [the latter] is afraid to goe to his master without itt. Here is a good trade, I am in greate hopes itt will continue soe, now the Dutch being gon from both places. The Captain of Tagarada will be here tomorrow, I suppose is to desire your Worship the English might settle there hee haveing made a pallavora the other day to that purpose, they are resolved to entertaine noe Dutch noe more att both places, but will stand to the English. The Addoomes have sent downe their people here to desire us to build a fort, but first [we] must buy the ground, the people of this place will assist in building of itt, they would faine have guns brought heither, then they would beleeve the English intended to build, their dayly pallavora's to mee is to write to your Worship of itt. I am inform'd that the Dutch have sent a dashey to the Cabasheers following vizt Quoteamboushou, Nakaba, Obonie, and Aymbo, to come here and route the English out, they being halfe of the Adooms. Tickadow desires that your Worship would send him a dashey for them, and hee will see itt distributed amongst them they being not well pleased that Tickadoe should have a dashey and not them. My monthly account I shall send per first oppertunity. Here is a Portuguze att Dickiscove. I shall send your Worship the money for the empty caske alsoe with my account."

Alsoe to what your Worship mentions concerning takeing charge of the warehouse [i.e. at Cape Coast Castle], since your Worship was soe kind as to give mee my choyce which I humbley returne your Worship thanks, I had rather serve the Company here (I now being well settled) then remove, I hope itt will prove well as to the Companys interest and where ever I am I will ever doe my endeavour to increase the same."

As concerning the ground the Addoomes will not abate anything of the price, Coffee will informe your Worship in full of their demands and pallavora's. Here is a greate many Addoomes and Wassa's in towne, waiting for powder, hopeing to be supply ed when a ship comes. The Captain of Taggarada was here yesterday, whoe proffered his own sonn for a pawne, provided the English would settle there. I now send your Worship on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company 8 marks of gold itt being all that is in cash att present. Here is a good trade, I could wish wee had a biger house by ourselves on the topp of the hill for wee cannot stow noe more goods with security the house being full, and if any fire should happen, wee liveing amongst a parcell of houses itt would be impossible for us to secure any. Wee want some blew pautka's, sheets and more perpettuanoes: but where to stow them I know not."

As to what your Worship mentions concerning a brick house, I only desired your Worship to furnish us with a new thatcht house on the top of the hill that if any fire should happen in the towne, none could doe us any harme. Docter Meade can give your Worship an account of this that I live in, haveing noe roome to stow the

The Cabbasheers of this towne are willing that hee should goe downe, but cannot by noe meanes perswaide him unless leave be first granted from Tickadoe. As concerning James Parris I suppose your Worship hath an account of him per Docter Meade before this time, whoe [i.e. Parris] was dead before the said Docters arrivall. As to shiping to windward I heard of one yesterday being att Axim, I am inform'd by the Blacks that itt is a greate English ship. Wee are in want of boysado's and sheets, alsoe perpetuano's.

Here is a greate deale of gold in towne, but all for powder, which they could not be supplyed with by Captain Browse, hee haveing disposed of all to windward. I have not disposed of anything since the said ships arrivall, only the Welch plaines your Worship sent last, and if I had more, I could sell them all att their arrivall. The people wanting powder is a greate hinderance to mee, for they send all their gold aboard for powder, and when they come there, they buy other goods. Here in towne I beleeve [there is] above 20 marks for powder. I want more goods, as boysado's, sheets, perpetuano's, but our house is not fitt to put any goods in. I now send inclosed James Parris's inventory of what things hee left at his death. When the greate canoe comes I shall send them downe to your Worship, with my monthly accompts.

As to news to windward I know of none, only I heare of a Dutch Companys ship being att Aboni [sic: = Abeni]. Here passed by the other day a small vessell, what shee was I know not. Per this canoe your Worship will alsoe receive James Parris his things."
21,1,21,Mark Bedford Whiting,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,22/09/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships of the 17th and 20th instant I have received together with 10 pieces of green Welch plaines, on account of the Royall Affrican Company whereof I have enclosed receipt but for 8, haveing given your Worship a receipt before for 10 when I received but 8 which was my mistake, I humbley returning your Worship thanks for adviseing mee thereof. I have according to your Worships order sent a canoe to Axim, and another to Dickiscove to the Cabbasheers of that place to demand satisfaction of them for soe verry highly abuseing the English, which att the returne of the canoe I shall give your Worship an account thereof. As concerning the setlemen[t] of this place, the Addooms are come downe and are willing to comply with your Worships proffer, and here doe stay to know whether your Worship is willing to lett them have 10 bendy's worth of goods out of this factory; if your Worship is willing to comply with I shall follow your orders therein and furnish them accordingly."
22,1,22,Mark Bedford Whiting,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,24/09/1683,Fort,RAC,"This is to acquaint your Worship that the Cabosheer that made the pallavora with your Worship hath been with Tickadoe and is come downe againe whoe informes mee that his master is willing to accept of the proffer made by your Worship, soe that if your Worship is pleased, that hee should be furnished here, I can furnish him with a parcell of damaged goods whoe is willing to except of the same att the same price as if they were good, soe expecting an answer as to that matter."
23,1,23,Mark Bedford Whiting,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,28/09/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships of the 26th instant I have received together with the articles, which the Addoomes will not signe to unless your Worship will take 6 peaze for every bendy, being unwilling to take the same for every bendy's worth of goods. Tickado's Cabasheere came downe yesterday with whome Hansacoe made the pallavora concerning that matter, but could not bring him to any reasonable terms, saying that if they had proffered any such thing to the Dutch, they would not make soe many words, Tickadoe being unwilling to entertaine them any more att this place. If your Worship is willing to lett them have 6 peaze for every bendy's worth of goods they will all signe the articles and take their fittish upon itt. As to the annuall charges they are all contented with [them]. Wee told them that the Company hath beene att a considerable charge in settleing the factory and with the annuall charges will amount to a greate sume of money. I shall take care to send up Captain Coffee, Atta with Samuell Chambers to Tickadoe to signe the articles att the returne of your Worships answer. Here is enclosed a letter from Monsieur Scheffer at Axim. As to Dickiscove people the Cabasheers hath promised to send a Cabasheere of that place up to Succondee that thereby wee may know what reason they have to abuse the English. Here arrived att this place two Dutch interlopers and an English one, whoe went hence for Shuma yesterday. The Dutch interloper hath taken a considerable parcell of money att this place for powder, att 5 peaze and 2 angles per barrell, heare came ashoare yesterday att least 35 barrells."
24,1,24,Mark Bedford Whiting,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,01/10/1683,Fort,RAC,"This is to acquaint your Worship that the Dutch last Sunday came here on shoare with a quantity of goods as sheets, beades and ginghams att 4 a clock in the morning, unknowne to these townes people, in order to resettle their factory which they pretend they left for want of goods and now being furnished will settle all places againe. Their arrivall here is unknowne to the Addooms whoe have often promised never to entertaine them noe more att this place. I have in order to this sent Captain Coffee, Samuell Chambers and Attah up to Tickadoe to acquaint him of itt, and to signe the articles of agreement, which if they signe they must either put the Dutch off or elce forfeite 100 marks according to the said agreement. Here is a greate disturbance att this place, some being for their staying and some for their
goeing off, and if they stay they will undersell us in beades and sheets, which they brought a considerable quantity. Sheets they sell 7 for 2 peaze and 8 for 2 peaze, that is 15 for an ounce. Here hath been dull trade with mee this month, but a good trade for those Dutch interlopers which sold a greate quantity of powder att 5 peaze per barrell, snap pans att 9 per bendy and those commodyty's swept up a considerable parcell of money. As to what your Worship writes concerning Captain Woolmans letter your Worship is misinform'd for I received the same from Captain Smiths owne hand when the ship was under saile and past by Taggarada and before she anchored here, the said letter was sent by mee to Cabo Corsoe, which is a thing impossible that a ship should be att the Mina 6 dayes when shee never was there. As concerning Mr Scheffer's letter, here is noe secure passage for any Blacks to goe, there being a differance betwixt the people of this place and Dickiscove, neither can I send a canoe unless I hyre itt on purpose, itt is verry seldome that any of these cano's goe thither unless itt be canoes sent from the Mina and soe stop here for refreshment."
25,1,25,Mark Bedford Whiting,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,03/10/1683,Fort,RAC,"This accompany's Hansacoe by whome your Worship will understand how affaires stands att this place, alsoe this is to lett your Worship understand that Captain Coffee, Attah and Samuell Chambers, after foure dayes journey towards the Addooms was forct to come back againe, meeting some of the Addooms by the way whoe inform'd them that Tickadoe and rest of the Cabasheers of Mampone are gon up to Wassa country which prevented their journey up, yett notwithstanding wee have taken care to send up a man to him to acquaint him of the Dutch landing here and of a White English man comeing up to Mampone, which if hee heares noe doubt but hee will come back. Here the Dutch doe undersell us both in sheets and beades, selling their sheets att 32 per bendy and wee 28 per bendy which is a greate deale of differance. I have not sold neither sheets nor beades since their arrivall. Sheets are the best commodyty that vends here. I shall take care to send downe the gold per Captain Coffee next weeke. I have taken care to send your Worships letter to Axim."
26,1,26,Mark Bedford Whiting,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,05/10/1683,Fort,RAC,"Since my last to your Worship per Hansacoe your Worships of the 4th instant I have
received wherein I shall observe your Worships order in lowering the sheets and greene perpetuano's. The Dutch have had this morning a fresh supply of goods as sayes, perpetuanoe's, broad tapsells, ginghams and beades; I understand that the Generall of the Mina is resolved to supply their factory here with all sorts of goods, and to sell them att low rates only to draw the country people in, and to gett us off of this place. The other day when I sent Coffee, Atta and Samuell Chambers to acquaint Tickadoe of the Dutch landing here, as soone as the Dutch Copeman heard of itt, hee presently sent for the Cabbasheers desireing them to goe and prevent us of our journey, which they came accordingly and would needs know what was the reason I sent a Whiteman to Tickadoe, and I would not informe them of itt, I asked them againe what was the reason they entertained the Dutch here after haveing made soe many promises never to entertaine them noe more, and for that verry reason I send a Whiteman to the Addoomes to acquaint them of itt, to knowe wheither they approve of it, then they desired mee to stay a weeke longer, I made answer that itt was your Worships order and I was not to observe theirs; then leave was granted, upon the condition that I had noe intent to doe any of this townes people any harme, yett notwithstanding they sent the Tetee of this towne along with Samuell Chambers to heare what pallavora was made betwixt Tickadoe and us, whome they are in greate feare of, and soe are the Dutch. Here is one Cabasheer that is ordered by the Addooms to looke after the English whoe is a greate enemie of the Dutch and hath promised to doe his endeavour to gett the Dutch off, hee hath sent one of his men to Tickadoe to acquaint him of the Dutch landing here, hee told the Cabasheers of this place that if they would use noe means to gett them off, hee would; they tould him againe that they [= the Dutch] were here before and that they had noe reason to putt them off. The Dutch man heareing of the said Cabasheere standing up for the English, hee sent him word that one day hee hop'd to see him at the Mina without his head, hee sent him word againe that hee had not better speake too much, least Tickadoe make him carry his stoole after him. The Dutch sells their perpetuano's greene att 8 angles each, ours are fair before them, some of the Blacks loves their collor best itt being a deeper dye; they sell alsoe their sheets at 32 per bendy, hee haveing lowered his price two dayes agoe telling the Negro's that if they would bring their money to him, and not carry itt to the English hee would sell 32 per bendy. Hee alsoe sells ginghams att 5 angles each, being 9 for 2 peaze. Beades he sells great quantity's of. As to sayes and broad tapsells I know not how hee sells them, they comeing on shoare but this morning. Wee are in want of perpetuano's, greene Welch plaines and sheets. Sheets I have not sold any since this Dutch arrivall, only this morning att the receiveing of your letter I sold a bendy's worth att 32 per bendy according to your Worships order. As to my monthly accompts, I shall endeavour to send Coffee with itt next weeke, with the ballance of itt. I have according to your Worships orders sent Mynheer Schiffer[s] letter to
Axim, when I have an answer from thence itt shall be forwarded to your Worship with all expedition."
27,1,27,Mark Bedford Whiting,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,08/10/1683,Fort,RAC,"This is to acquaint your Worship that last night the towne of Succondee was sett on fire in three severall places, by whome wee know not. The Cabasheers houses are all bur[n]t and if care had not been taken by the said Cabasheers our factory would have been bur[n]t too, but I thank God wee escaped the same and soe did the Dutch whoe escaped verry narrowly, one of the houses was blowne up with powder, haveing in one halfe barrell which burnt six severall people which I feare will not live. Here is a greate many Wassa's in towne which hath given mee in hand 9 marks of gold for powder att 6 pease per barrell which if your Worship can possibly supply them, they will take itt off my hands from the waterside and carry itt up to Wassa country least itt should come to any damage in the towne. Here the Dutch are lett alone in their wayes, noe body doth molest them, they sell abundance of beades and sheets alsoe ginghams and a few perpetuano's. If I had a better house on the top of the hill, where I could be out of danger of any fire and had a quantity of each sort of goods I should make a good hand of itt. The Dutch sells his sayes att 1 ounce, the Negro's loves their sayes better then ours, they esteeme their collour better. I am in want of green Welch plaines, perpetuano's, sheets (blew Welch plaines are noe commodity here, I have a parcell of them but will not sell). I have not yett had any news from the Addoomes, here is one of the said people in towne whoe informes mee that foure dayes hence Tickadoe will send downe one of his Cabasheers heither. As concerning Mr Scheffer I have noe answer as yett. Had not this fire happened last night I would have sent my accompts to your Worship according to your Worships order, but now I am takeing care to gett the thatch to cover the house againe which was taken downe last night for feare of the fire. As soone as itt is finished Coffee shall come downe with the said accompts and the gold."
28,1,28,Mark Bedford Whiting,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,15/10/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships of the 13th instant is come to hand together with the powder and the green Welch plaines per the 9 hand canoe. The powder I disposed according to promise which now I send downe the product of the same with my monthly accompts with the ballance thereof per this conveyance. I humbley begg your Worships pardon for not finishing my September accompt before. Had not this fire happened which caused us to pull downe the thatch off the house and made us take care for the covering of the same againe, I had finished them some dayes agoe, but for the future I shall observe your order per your last. I hope in a short time to be out of danger of any fire that shall happen in towne, when the Royall Companys factory is built, which is now put forwards, the people of this place being about itt,
some are gon to cutt wood, some to make durt, others are rowsaing the ground where your Worship ordered itt should be built. I shall be in this as spareing and in all other things as spareing as possible in order to the Royall Companys benefitt. I have according to your Worships order gott the articles of agreement signed by the Cabasheers of Mampone by order of Tickadoe, they promiseing to putt the Dutch off and att the signing of the said articles, they made the Cabasheers of this towne take their fittish to be true and faithfull to the English. I delivered according to contract 10 green perpetuano's, whereof most of them being damaged and 10 green Welch plaines att the signing of the agreement. As to Dickiscove pallavora, I cannot come to speake with any of the Cabasheers of the said place, the people of this place haveing abused some of their wives which hath bred a differance betwixt them both soe that they panyar one another. Tickadoe is comeing downe to fight that place, they haveing alsoe abused the Addooms severall times, and when hee doth come hee hath sent the Dutch here word that he will not show them a trick unless they remove. Wee are in great want for more powder alsoe brass basons which are a greate comodyty amongst the Wassa's, here being above 100 bendy's in towne att this time for those two sorts of comodyty's. If the Royall Companys factory was built and was but supplyed with powder, sheets and brass basons and green Welch plaines, the Dutch would take but little gold, and that as they would take would be for beades. If your Worship can possibly spare more powder I have ready money in hand for 30 barrells and here is also 10 bendy's for brass basons which I hope your Worship will be soe kind as to supply us with. I now send your Worship 7 marks, 7 ounces per the bearer hereof hopeing your Worship will supply us with the abovesaid goods. I must informe your Worship that the Wassa's are in great want of perpetuano's blew, the Dutch here have great quantity of them but the country people will not buy them being less then ours."
29,1,29,Mark Bedford Whiting,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,20/10/1683,Fort,RAC,"This is to acquaint your Worship that here is come to towne a greate many Wassa's and Addoomes whoe are want of sheets, perpetuano's, brass basons, powder. They might be supplyed here from the Dutch with some of these goods, but being ordered to the contrary by Tickadoe [not] to have any thing to doe with the said people. I have a few sheets but not enough, alsoe a few perpetuano's but noe blew ones to put the green off. The said country people are willing to stay soe many dayes, according to contract untill your Worship can possibley supply them. I must informe your Worship that Mr Scheffer of Axim was unwilling to put the 9 hand canoe in the 15 hand canoe least the 15 hand canoe should come to any harme
neither would hee suffer them to be lasht together, soe that hee was forst to hyre 5 men more to bring the 9 hand canoe downe which I discharg'd here and paid them 2 angles per man. Here came the other day a fresh supply of goods for the Dutch, as perpetuano's, sheets, and brandy. Perpetuano's, hee sells as we does, blews att 10a and green att 9a and reds att 8a. As to news I heare of none, neither doe I heare of any shiping to windward. If your Worship can possibly spare Coffee I humbly desire of your Worship to send him up, that hee may overlooke the people that are building the Royall Companys factory, hee knowing how itt was contrived before, hee then being here att the building of itt."
30,1,30,Mark Bedford Whiting,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,22/10/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships of the 20th instant I have received together with the 91 brass basons, which shall be disposd according to your Worships order, on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company. I wrote your Worship per the Axim canoes for some sheets, alsoe perpetuano's, powder, and if your Worship can spare us more basons of that size (if not bigger) I can dispose of them. But as for powder, sheets and perpetuano's blew, wee are in greate want which I humbly begg your Worship to supply us with that wee may keepe the money from the Dutch whoe are well supply'd with these two sorts of commodyty's, sheets and perpetuano's, and although their perpetuano's are most blew yett the country people chusing rather to stay for a fresh supply of ours, they being far better then the Dutch which are but small. Here is a greate quantity of gold in towne for powder and other goods. Tickadoe hath sent heither a lusty man slave and hath promised to send downe more if your Worship is willing to buy them, they aske for the said slave 7 peaze, but I proffer them but 6 and if your Worship is willing to comply with I humbly begg of your Worship to supply us with snap pans for the said slave, they being unwilling to take any other sort of goods. As to the Royall Companys factory itt goes forward and if your Worship can possibly spare Coffee I humbly begg of your Worship to send him up."
31,1,31,Mark Bedford Whiting,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,27/10/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships of the 24th instant I have received per Captain Coffee with the following goods vizt 2 bayles containing 50 perpetuano's, 92 brass basons containing 325 pounds, 5 chests containing 325 sheets, 10 barrells of gun powder, 50 pieces greene Welch plaines and 20 snap pans on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England. The powder I disposed att the waterside with other goods, I have alsoe disposed of most of the greene Welch plaines. If your Worship can possibly spare us more greens with redd and yallow but noe blews, they being not in demand here; I have a parcell here of blews, I could wish your Worship would be pleased to exchange them for redd and yallow, perhapps blews are better at Cabo Corsoe. As concerning the brass panns I cannot gett more then 7 taccoes per pound and hardly that, I have disposed of 3 bendy's worth of them after that rate, haveing used all possible meanes to gett 8 tacco's per pound but cannot prevaile. As to the snap pans your Worship sent for the procureing of slaves, the slave that I wrote your Worship about was redeemed by some of the Wassa's, whoe gave the Addooms a bendy for his redemption before the said snap pans came on shoare and with the said money [the latter] bought part of the snap pans att 8 per bendy, they being for Tickado's present occasion. Here is a good trade at present and as soone as the Royall Companys factory is finished I hope your Worship will be soe kind as to supply us with all sorts, then wee shall make a good hand of itt for some loves one sort of a thing and some loves other sorts. I shall send downe next weeke what money is in cash. Here is noe news to windward, some canoes came from Axim yesterday and noe shiping is to windward."

I hope by the blessing of God allmighty to follow the same. I am safe arrived here and pitcht upon a house for the Company's factory which with a little charge may be made very serviceable, it stands not far from the harber soe being better capable to see what canoes goes out and in to hinder their tradeing with interlopers. The King himselfe gave me this house. Captain Bracon and all the rest of Great and Small Commenda gives your honour harty thankes in sending me hither, they all say your comands or mine by your Honour shall be observed. The most goods at present here vendable are iron barrs which are good, narrow niccanees, and tapselles, blew perpettuanoes, sheets and brawles. If your Honour will send me 100 iron barrs they are sold, to be understood in a canoe. Pray send me such goods as the Castle affords as soon as possible you can and that good not damaged. Once I have the name to have good goods the traders will come the more to me

Your Honour will be pleased to send per bearer 40 iron barrs more, pray lett them be good barrs, or elce for the future wee will have but little trade in them. I give your Honour hearty thankes that you have pleased to consider to lett this factory have such goods as the Castle affords.

If the ship be not gone pray send some brass kettles, allso a halfe peece of red and a halfe peece of blew cloath. The Generall of the Mine sent some dayes agone his Chief Cabbisheer Aban to Chama, Jabie and the Antha country to agree with the natives not to bring theire gold to Commenda, he instigated them as much against the English as possible he can; but alas
the whole country hates him from Ashanee to Fanteen, and as for this place they have broken downe the factory to the ground, and stolen away all the stones that was for the building theire fort. I could wish the ship was here to stop theire mouths."
36,1,36,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,18/11/1681,Fort,RAC,"Just now came a Commenda man from Axim who was aboard of a Dutch interloper: Ditto interloper tould the Blacke that he left at Ashanee and Abbene 3 English shipps, whereof 2 belong to the Royall Company and that they thought to be downe within 10 dayes. The Generall of the Minas Cabbisheer is mighty bussie, Aban by name, about resettling of a factory for the Dutch, also for turning us out. Ditto Aban has sent for a great many musketteers the which past by this place this day. They have also a difference with the natives at Chama. The factory they are settling is Succondee. This being writ in hast begg pardon."
37,1,37,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,22/11/1681,Fort,RAC,"Just now Captain Samuell Starland came ashoare and told me your Honour had not sent the 5 hand canoe. Wee having not one canoe at Commenda to bring the goods ashoare, therefore my humble desire is to send the 5 hand canoe heither, also one hogshead of brandy for I have had none this 6 dayes, and among the blacks there is nothing to be done without brandy.

The 5 hand canoe has been imploy'd ever since in unloading the ship which wee hope to dispatch by Tuesday night. Be pleased to send us per this canoe halfe a peece of red cloath more, as likewise the price of it. This morning the blacks by the King of Aguaffos order tooke a Portugueze ship in this roade, and sent the people ashoare.
[PS] Wee must begg your Worship to excuse our not sealing this letter, for wee have neither wax nor wafers, which wee hope you will be pleased to supply us with, as likewise with some paper."

Wee are sorry you should thinke wee would charge the Company with sending to Capo Corso upon any frivolous account but it was Captain Bracons desire that you should be informed of the Portugues being taken soe sent one of his owne canoes. Wee have noe further account of the reason of it then that some time since a Portugues in this roade paniard 5 of the Kings relations. Wee refer your Worship to Captain Starland for a more perticular relacon of the busieness.

40,1,40,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,02/12/1681,Fort,RAC,"Your honours dated the 29th November came safe to my hands and have punctually observed the same. Cabisheer Agamaco has been with the King and told him your honours commands, his answer is that about 4 yeares agoe he sent 5 men of his relation to assist a Portuguese in selling his goods and buying his slaves, but ditto Portuguese comeing to Wyamba to leward carried them clearly away, and were never heard of since. Ditto King has had no occasion since came in place to demand satisfaction of any Portuguese, but this man hee suffering 4 of his men to lye ashoare, which aforesaid men told the blacks that now was the time to have satisfaction, which one of them is by name Emanuell, a great rogue, for he has been in service both of us and Danes. I have seen him whipt att the gunn att Capo Corsoe severall times. Hee intends to serve your honour, I have turn'd him out of the factory and broke his head. After the 4 men were ashoare ditto Captain came ashoare, and afterwards his boate. I told the Capain pray goe aboard in your boate, the blacks intend to take your ship, but hee being a low hearted man was afraid, and that time his ship was not [sic?] taken. Ditto Portuguese Captain has been with the King, who told him that hee should have his ship againe, and when satisfaction was made for the 5 persons his relation, hee should have the remaynder now taken repaid either in gold or slaves, and desired to know what he had lost because them that tooke itt shall not steal any of the goods. Now as concerning our factory to sustayne any damages or the looseing any of the Royall Company's goods, your honour will be pleased to consider the contract between your honour and the King and alsoe their pawnes and our strength and commands upon the coast, alsoe the great charges the Company has been att in settleing itt. I doe assure your honour when the factory was last removed, the King was the person that sent 300 men to our assistance, and brought Captain Seaman, Captain Hill, their mates, doctors, myselfe, Griffin [and] the Royall Companies goods safe off the shoare. I did not loose the worth of a cracra. The King sends mee word that as long as Bracon is att the waterside and his relation and hee himselfe above att Great Commenda, that the haire of one of the Royall Companys servants shall not be touched, much less the loss of the Company goods. And as to my person pray rest assured your honours commands shall alwaies by mee be observed. According to orders [I] send my Accra accounts. Your honour will find that Mr Hassell will give the Company creditt for the 1 ounce, 5 angles and 10 taccoes in his account; if not [I] will pay your honour and demand of Hassell the same. There is a Portuguese shipp att Axim.
[PS] Mr Wender presents his most humble service to your Honour."
41,1,41,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,03/12/1681,Fort,RAC,"This accompanies the Portuguese Captain, by name Emanuell Consalves, whoe left his smack in this roade. Ditto Captain reports that his ship is not serviceable to saile to St Thoma. Soe having noe more onely referr myselfe per letter to your honour by Cabisheer Agamaco."

Tomorrow I shall give your worship a more particular answer to your letters."
43,1,43,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,09/12/1681,Fort,RAC,"According to your order I have been aboard the Dutch ship, whoe hath brought a cargoe of 10,000 pounds prime cost, from Middelborough, many sheets but few perpettuanoes. The news in Europe is that the King of France (alias French King) hath banished out of his Kingdome all Protestants. The Prince of Orange hath been of late in England, and tis supposed uppon noe good intent. One of the chiefest lords in England is put in the Tower, the relater not knowing his name. The Duke of York is in England, and in great esteem both with King and people. There is suppos'd to be a war between Sweden and Denmark, but not yett published. This ship has brought two factors, three Assistants and 7 souldiers, sailed out of Zealand the last of October. There is a ship coming from Amsterdam, with a new Generall by name D. Peere, whoe was formerly one of the Lords of Zealand, and is dayley expected here. Captain Balck tells mee that there is above 5,000 marks of gold in cash att the Mine and what the Generall intends to doe with it none knowes. The first ship that sailes from the Mine to Europe will be Captain Leendart Joosten van Dyck, with two of the small ships more. Itt will be the latter end of January before Captain Balk will depart. Both these Captains presents their humble servants to your worship, and will be glad to serve you in carrieing letters for Europe, or any thing elce that lies in their power but begg pardon that they cannot waite on you att Capo Corsoe. As for paints, linseed oyle, and the draughts of the coast I will procure for your worship if possible. Last night passed by two ships but know not what they were."

The names of the skepers is as followeth, Leendart Joosten van Dick, Commander of the ship Roterdam bound for Roterdam; Marinues Willmess Commander of the ship the Armes of Zurch Zee, bound for Zeeland; Machiell Joosten Commander of the ship Minyderbergh, bound for Amsterdam. Any of the aforesaid skeepers will carry your honours letters safe. I am satisfied that there is arrived att Dickiscove an English ship pretty big and of good force, supposed to be a Company's ship. Wee may hope of Captain Woodfine being there.

[PS] Pray send per this canoe, the man slave."
51,1,51,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,05/01/1682,Fort,RAC,"Your honours dated ultimo December came safe to my hands. As to an answer, that as soone I heard the slaves run away I sent immediatly to the King, Captain Bracon and the Mareene to procure them for us according to contract, but they never came ashoare here, itt was above 6 miles from hence towards Jabin. As to the two slaves being paid [for] 11 a apiece I never heard of itt. The Captain never came to mee, if [he] had [I] should have told him your honours contract, itt is his owne falt for he plainely told if the blacks had asked a bendy a head he would have paid itt, for he had a selfe interest in itt, which I beleeve he has for not one of the 12 slaves are bought for the Company marchandize, but [they were] absolutely panyard with all the teeth they had. I know 4 of them myselfe which are great traiders att Cestus, I have been ashoare with them both att Cestus and Basha. I beleeve the next English ship will pay for itt. Docter Griffin and I have done our endeavour to gett the slaves, wee have gott 8, two are aboard before and two drownd. The king has had a great deale of trouble alsoe, wee heare, to gett the slaves, they being disperst in a great many places. As for your honour blameing my unjustice and Captain Bracon[s] ill conscience [it] is undeserved, as Docter Griffin will give your honour a particular account. Wee humbly begg your honour not to blame us for wee have committed noe fault, and as to abuse received att the factory, there has been none committed onely that the ships in the road have taken aboard above 160 marks in gold and wee to the contrary ashoare none at all, which may be very well supposed att the rates they sell their goods at and wee haveing none to supply them, but now I hope your honour will be pleased to send mee what supply your honour can spare mee per first occasion. In short, here is gold if wee had good currant goods and the rates accordingly, which I humbly begg your honour to consider, itt being the windermost factory where shipping sells their goods soe abominable cheape. I send your honour my December account, you will be pleased to consider, that itt is the month of charges, being the first settleing, and I assure your honour itt has cost mee not little besides to gett the natives to bee friends with our masters the Royall Affrican Company, which will without doubt for the future be for their profitt if your honour continues this factory; if not am of opinion that the Dutch, French or other nations will soone inhabitt itt, which to the contrary in our possession noe other nations can doe itt, and wee once being removed itt will not easily be gott againe. The King of Commenda presents his service to your honour and understands by reports that the King of Fettue intends to make war against him. Hee desires your honour to know what the reason may be, either if his person or people are abused or if hee or his country owes him any money, hee desires your honour to write mee an answer. In the meanetime I take leave and referr the rest to the report of Docter Griffin whoe will give your honour an account in generall."
52,1,52,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,24/01/1682,Fort,RAC,"This is onely to give your honour an account that I have received 4 peeces of boysados, 25 perpettuanoes, 6 3 lb and 30 4 lb pewter basons, 36 looking glasses, 30 brawles, 50 Guinie stuffs, 10 course sletias, 20 silk longees, 12 course blanketts, and 130 sheets, for which shall give the Royall Company credit"
53,1,53,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,19/01/1682,Fort,RAC,"Your honours dated the 17th instant per Mr John Smith came safe to my hands. As
to an answer of the fire itt is as followeth. On Monday being the 16th instant the fire began about 8 a clock at night about 50 paces to windward from us, which consumed within less than  of an hours time above 200 houses, occasioned by one frieing of fish in palm oyle. The old Queene and Captain Bracon lost all they had, only saved their gold, and as to the Royall Company's concerns att the heate of the fire [I] was afraid that I should not save one cracra worth but the great mercy of God Almighty and assistance of my boys and Commenda people saved all only 1 chest of sheets, 21 lead barrs, 5 31b pewter basons, 28 41b ditto, 85 chests of corne, 10 pewter jugs. The remains [I] have with Mr Smith compared with my accounts and books and found that did agree. The lead barrs, juggs, basons, were in the roome with the iron [and?] are melted, I have saved of itt as much as possible could. The sheets were in my owne room which are consumed with most part of my owne goods. As to the corne [I] had bought and paid for 129 chests, whereof is remayning above 40 odd. I doe assure your honour if such an accident had befallen the Dutch, they would not have saved one penny's worth. The Dutch heareing that our factory was consumed with all the Royall Company's concerns, were very hott to settle their factory, but I have stopt their designe, and what is possible of the contract shall be observed. Here is in the road a great French ship between 30 or 40 guns, about 200 men. I told the Capushers last night to remember your honours contract, and that none here should come ashoare for [I] intend absolutely with Captain Bracons assistance to hinder all them that should act anything prejudiciall to my masters the Royall Affrican Company. Here are likewise in the road two English interlopers, the one called Captain Young the other I doe not know. I desire your honour to send mee your order and Councill if any come ashoare to hinder their designe. I desire your honour be pleased to send some body here to see what is best to be done about the factory, either repairing this or to build where the factory was formerly, and what length and breadth your honour will be pleas'd to order it. I also desire your honour that you would be pleased to consider the loss and charge I am att, also to allow some gratuity to the people that soe trusty assisted mee in saveing the Company's goods, and especially Mr Harper for his care in the midst of the fire, for wee all were afraid the factory would blow up by reason of the powder. If my opinion may be excepted I could advise what is to be done, and att the least charge, about our factory. Soe haveing no more to inlarge only referr the rest to the report of Mr Smith whoe will give your honour a particular account. In the meane time am in a distressed condition as to my person but the Companys goods are secure.
[PS] The reason I have not writt before was for want of inke."
54,1,54,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,21/01/1682,Fort,RAC,"Last night understanding by the blacks that there was a differance between the English interloper and the Frenchman in this road thought fitt to send this morning aboard the French ship to understand the reason because I might give your honour an account of it, which is as followeth. Mr Harper comeing from on board the Frenchman reports mee that the French Captain sent his boate with his Leiuetenant aboard of Captain Young an English interloper and demanded in the King of France his name his pass and commission but ditto Captain replyed you French dogg gett you gon with all your people out of my ship or else I will kill you, and said wee are the King of Englands subjects and an interloper, and bid him come aboard to fight him, whereupon hee made his guns ready but the French leiutenant comeing aboard told his Captain all transactions, whereupon the French Captain with his marchant Monsieur Bardoe [var. Bordoe] sent a civill answer in writing to the interloper desireing not to be soe bold for hee would doe him noe harme here, but as soone as the Frenchman had understood of your honour that the English man was an interloper and noe Royall Company's ship, [he] would doe the Royall Company that service as soone as once was to leward of Capo Corsoe, would take the interloper above mentioned; the which in Monsieur Bordoe [var. Berdoe] marchant whose [= his] name and their companys seal I send your honour inclosed, [he] reports that his ship came about 3 months agoe from Rusborg very neare Rochell, their old company being broake, and haveing a new one very desireous to settle in these parts, and to that intent gives great encouragement to the Blacks, alsoe that dayly here is expected two Frenchmen of war with a Generall and marchandize, goods and materialls to settle the Gold Coast, especially to build a fort att Commenda,  which by contract has been agreed 10 yeares agoe, for these people here sent a black to France whoe spoke with the King himselfe. Therefore now is time for us to looke after our masters the Royall Affrican Company's place and interests upon the coast, and if once being gone itt will not be easie to gett them againe, especially Commenda, Wyamba, Succonde, Lague which are privilidged places to the Royall Affrican Company of England."
55,1,55,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,24/01/1682,Fort,RAC,"Your honours dated the 21st instant came safe to my hands. [I] am glad to heare
that your honour has been pleased to consider that I have done my endeavour as to the saveing the Royall Company's marchandise from burning and other damage. Itt was noe more but my duty, but doe assure your honour itt was difficult, but hope by the blessing of god almighty never to see such an accident att Commenda againe. Your honour has been pleased to command my small opinion about rebuilding the Royall Companys factory, which is as followeth. Att the first place in my opinion itt will be more profittable and secure for the Company to rebuild the factory where itt was formerly or there about, by reason itt is the only place to build a fort at, it being higher ground then any place att Commenda; alsoe [it is] the Royall Company's owne ground, itt is to windward of all the towne, to prevent fire, in short a small fort being built can command both sea and land. Secondly am advised by Captain Bracon and others here, that if your honour dus not resolve to sett both the people of Great and Small Commenda very speedily about building the old factory, that the raines will goe neare to prevent the finishing of itt, for I count but 3 months till the raines comes in. In the interim the people are willing to give mee their assistance in rebuilding this house for the security of the Companys goods and interest untill the other be built, and that att as little charge as may be. Therefore my desire is your honour will be pleased to keepe a good and faire corespondence with the King of Commenda and the people here soe that they and I may know your honours orders and designes, for I am confident they will doe what lies in their power for our advantages and assistance, both in the rebuilding and tradeing, as yesterday I have found, for haveing according to your honours orders notice of their tradeing with the French and other ships I sent my complaint to the King, whoe immediatly sent for the people of this place up to Aguaffo, whoe are not yett return'd but [I] have had advice from thence that the King made them take the fittish not to buy any goods aboard of ships provided wee had them in the factory or could procure them in 15 dayes time. Whatever your honour is pleased to conclude on for the rebuilding I desire your honour will send a fitt person who may survey the charge the Company will be att either for building or rebuilding, as likewise to contrive what may be done and att the least charge and best convenience for the Royall Companys interest, that in this case I may be blameless for any extravagancies of charge, for I am resolv'd not to extend the limitts of your honours order. As touching the French I have noe other information then what I have writt formerly, only that Monsieur Ducas comes Generall with two men of warr of 45 gunns apeece, and one small frigat and two sloopes to settle upon this coast. Att present here noe transactions of any importance, only Captain Bracon with the rest of the marchants here and I thought fitt to send Captain Coffee to give your honour an account of all pasages and to know your honours commands, if your honour pleases to grant metigation of the prizes of your says, Guni stuffs, brawles, alsoe silk and
herba longees, itt is probable next month may take some gold. This month the Companys ships and others have sold soe cheape that I have had noe trade hitherto. The people who were soe trusty in assisting mee in the fire, dus dayly call out for some recompence according as I promis'd them in my extremity, to which I desire your honours order per next conveyance."
56,1,56,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,28/01/1682,Fort,RAC,"Your Honours dated the 26th instant I have received and understand your Honour will be pleased to build a factory for the Royall Company at the old place it was formerly, but I begg your Honour to give me the liberty to build a little higher, to be understood the place where a fort may stand, it being hard by the old factory but better situated, also to inhedge soe much ground in for the Royall Company as possible can, for now is the time, and when I receive your Honours model and directions shall endeavour to carry on the affaires according to your Honours order. The people here give your Honour humble thanks for the gratueity, and I have paid them in silke longees the worth of a peece of say, which does incourage them and upon all occasions [they] shall be at your Honours commands. Yesterday arrived here a small interloper bound for the Bite, his name unknowne. Captain Young is still in the road. I here of noe ships to windward."
57,1,57,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,01/02/1682,Fort,RAC,"Your Honours per Captain Coffie dated the 28th January came safe to hand, and shall according to your Honours resolution observe your order therein, soe in the building and prices of goods as have been formerly ordered, but if your Honour pleases to give 25 peeces of Guinea stuffs per benda I can dispose of 500 presently.
The reason I sent the rates of the goods to Capo Corsoe was that the Arcanies and others was informd that I vallued higher then Capo Corso rates, but now to the contrary they found their error.
I send your Honour my January account with the ballance of the same to Mr Spurvay amounting to 7o 15a 2ta, also 2o 5a 9ta being the ballance of my Accra account and 5o 9a 2ta being the ballance of December account of Comenda factory. The reason wee had noe more gold this month was because soe many ships of the Company, French and others have been in this road and undersold us, also the great disturbance of the fire. In the meane time am repairing this house for the safegard of the Company goods, till the other be build, which will come to some small charge. I will doe my endeavor to bring it soe lowe as possible can."
58,1,58,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,11/02/1682,Fort,RAC,"I having nothing of inportance to advise your Honour only that I heare of a great English ship to windward, supose it may be the St George.
As to our building cannot possitive give your Honour an account, having a palavera with the King and waterside people about it. Also a designe to turne some of the great rogues out that hinders our trade and assist interlopers, therefore pray send me downe one of your Cappusheers, that he may heare the palavero and give your Honour an account.
It is not for our harme but profitt, for all is well heare.
[PS] Pray lett your Cappusheer be here in the morning."
59,1,59,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,15/02/1682,Fort,RAC,"Your Honours dated the 11th instant came safe to my hands. [I] answer that all the powder remaining last month was sold the 5th instant, for as soon received your Honours letter presently have shewed Hansico the warehouse as he can give your Honour an account.
As to corne I have in all 85 chests. If your Honour pleases to order me to give 1 angle per chest I am of oppinion can procure a good quantity, for course sletias, green perpettuanes, or gold, for other ships give 2 angles per chest.
As to the reason I sent for one of your honours Cappusheers, was this, that I would have these people know that your Honours comands in behalfe of the Royall Affrican Company of England should absolutly be obteined, and would know before wee build the factory the reason it was not on theire side accomplished, and especially here being soe many rogues of other countrys that went aboard of ships without leave, that I would panyare them. They not beleiving me sent of severall canoes with musquetts to take them and put them all from aboard an interloper comanded by Captain Been, which occasioned a long and strong palavora, but at the end [I] made the merchants and Arcanies take this country fetish that none should goe aboard of any ship to trade contrary to your Honours articles, and alsoe prendee'd them three sheep, whereof your Honour will receive two from the transgressers, but it has been chargeable to me, besides [I] paid 12 angles in gold and one anchor of brandy, the brandy was spent in the 5 dayes palavora, and the 12a was given to the fetishmakers and Cappusheers. The Comenda merchants and Arcanies likewise paid to the Cappusheers and fetishmakers 1 ounce 8 angles of gold besides the Kings Mareen. Your honour haveing formerly ordred me to incourage these people not to let any other nation come ashoare was the occasion, soe that for the future wee may here order your Honours comands, which shall at all times be observed in what lyes in my power.
As to the building of your Honours factory tomorrow the people intend to goe about it, they demand 10 anchors of brandy for the whole charge of building, halfe in hand the other halfe when it is build, and that according to the draught, for they will doe their endeavor to have it finished before the raines. Pray let me have one or two slaves that has expearence in building for assisting and directing the workmen.
There is at Axhim Captain Nicholas Van Home in a ship of 36 gunns, his second with 24 ditto, and two Branderburgers of good force. They are full of goods and lets noe trade be where they come to anchor.
I would have written more at large but am not well, therefore pray pardon me, the rest I leave to Cappusheer Hansico who will give your Honour a generall account."
60,1,60,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,20/02/1682,Fort,RAC,"This accompanies Captain Daniell Gates, to whom I have delivered 103 chests of corne, 85 at la per chest and 18 at la per ditto as per his receipt. As to the charge of giveing the people the fetish Hansico was wittness to the particular disbursements.
In referrence to the building of the house, upon receipt of your Honours order for giving of the 10 anchors of brandy, I called the Cappusheers together and gave them advice thereof and of your Honours pleasure for their provideing of doors and windows but they told me the brandy they desired was only for a dashey and that they expected besides that 3 marks in mony for the building, whereupon I disperst them in great anger, but Captain Bracon being loath [it] should goe soe brought the Cappusheers here this morning and by his perswasions in presents of Captain Gates did offer to take the fetish to have the house build before the raines providing your Honour would allow 5 bendaes vizt the one halfe in hand the other halfe at the finished of the worke and this for the whole charge of building without any dasheys except what I am willing to give of my selfe, which your Honour may consider will not be little, I being dayly among them when they are at worke. As to the doors, doorcases and windows it is unpossible for these people to gett, this country not affording wood for that use, wherefor I hope your Honour will be pleased to supply those necessaries from Capo Corso, also some pickaxes and iron crowes. As to preventing forreigners landing at this place, I hope my endeavor shall prove answerable to your Honours demands.
I desire your Honour to send me for the account of the Royall Company for the supply of this factory, some broad and narrow niccanees, tapseels ditto, white
long cloaths, course sletias, course blanketts, all sorts of pewter basons, likewise  casque of brandy.
I have sent a merchant to Capo Corso with 6 bendaes of gold to be bestowed in copper barrs. I desire to know how many you give per benda, and if the rates be reasonable, it is like may prove heare a commodity vendible.
I begg your Honours speedy answer concerning the affaires of building by my boy Tom who brought your Honours pacquett from de Mina.
PS. As yet can give your Honour noe account about the Deanes [= Danes] slaves for had noe answer from Aguaffo."
61,1,61,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,23/02/1682,Fort,RAC,"Your Honours of the 22nd of this instant came safe to my hand, per order thereof I have this day delivered to the Cappusheeres 5 ounces of gold according to agreement who are well satisfied, and doe faithfully promise the accomplishment of the factory before the raines.
I have sent this canoe cheifly aboard of the ship at the Mina for your Honours pacquett, whoe I doubt not but shall receive it, if ever comes to the Captains hands, for I did never heare any thing of your pacquett before which wayes I had writt for it with the last conveniencey.
I desire you would be pleased to send up one of the blacke bricklayers to oversee the building for whome wee now only waite, delaying the foundation for one fitt person to direct the same, likewise the crowes and pickaxes are much wanting for the worke. I also desire your Honour will be pleased to send me by this oppertunity upon account of the Royall Company 30 gallons of brandy, for the carrying whereof I have sent 5 anchors.
I am uncapable of writing at present by reason of a lameness both in hands and leggs, it is a very bad distemper in this country and hath keept me since Munday last. I take it to be the same desease that troubled Captain Seamans. I begg your Honour to acquaint Docter Mead with this my desease, that he may send up what he knowes convenient for preventing the same, and if Docter Asskin be in the Castle I begg your Honour to send him up for applying of Docter Meads directions.
In my last by Captain Gates I forgott to give you an account of the charges I was at in putting the corne aboard which was in all 8 angles."
62,1,62,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,03/03/1682,Fort,RAC,"Your honours dated the 24th February have received, alsoe 32 gallons of brandy for the which I have given the Company creditt for in my February accounts which I send per the bearer, alsoe the ballance thereof in gold amounting to Mk 1.4.5.4 ta to Mr Spurvay. I am sorry that our building does not goe on according to my desire,
which is only occasioned by the wanting of crows, pickaxes and shovells, for the ground is soe hard it is unpossible for the people to worke itt without those necessaries, which I hope your Honour will send upon receipt hereof, as likewise a fitt person to direct the worke, for itt will not be without great trouble, labour and difficulty if this building be accomplished before the raines which I expect about the 25th of Aprille next. Here is in this roade an English interloper which sells his says att 14 angles per peece and other goods proportionable. There is likewise a Dutch interloper at Pompandee. There are noe other English ships to windward that I know."
63,1,63,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,03/03/1682,Fort,RAC,"I send your honour by my boatswaine one good woeman slave for the Royall Company's account. Pray lett mee have a receipt, as alsoe a man that can direct the worke and the materialls which I writt for this day. All the people are working this day to breake clay."
64,1,64,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,15/03/1682,Fort,RAC,"Your honours of the 12th and 13th instant I have received, as likewise Yankey with his materialls, but am sorry you term my charges extravagant seeing I have charged nothing but what was clearly disburst upon the Companys account. As to Mr Winders busieness I hope you will be pleased to allow of seeing I paid him his sallery in goods out of the warehouse haveing had noe order to the contrary. According to your honours order soe soone as haveing notice of the arrivall of any of the Companys ships [I] shall endeavour to acquaint them with your honours commands, I being very sencible of the Dutch their treachery to our nation if they can effect itt either by sea or land, therefore I humbly thank your honour for your kind advice thinking itt fitt if itt please your honour to send one to Dickiscove to prevent our peoples landing att Axim or any of the Dutch windward places. Just now is returned my boy from the Mina whoe brings mee an account of the pacquetts good dispatch as you may plainly see by the inclosed letters."
65,1,65,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,05/04/1682,Fort,RAC,"I have sent your Honour by this canoe (being afraid to send by land) my March account with the ballance thereof to Mr Spurvay which is Mk 1: 7: 15: 2. Captain Shears arrived here upon Monday night and I have done my endeavour to pur-
chase corne for him but can buy none cheaper then 2 angles per chest besides the charge for carrying itt aboard whereof I gave your honour advice in my last of the 29th March. Pray send with the first conveniency upon the account of the Royall Company for supply of this factory 100 niccanees narrow, 200 Guynea stuffs, 6 boysadoes, 4 chests of sheets, 20 sletias course, 20 course blanketts, pewter basons of all sorts. These are the goods wanting here att present and the marchants being come downe does keep their money for us, therefore I begg your honour to send up these goods with all speed, if delayed I feare they may buy their goods either of the Dutch or interlopers, there being two to windward. If your honour does not think itt safe to send the goods by the 15 hand canoe be pleased to order Captain Shears downe for the same and if the price of the corne be acceptable shall purchase what possibly I can against her returne. I beg your honour would order one man slave from aboard of Captain Shears for the use of the factory. Captain Bracon humbly thanks your honour for your kindess but the knives being alwayes sold att 1 angle per dozen [he] sendeth these back as too deare, therefore hee desires the Captain would send him his money or knives att the ordinary price of 1 angle per dozen. Soe soone as Captain Shears comes downe to Cabo Corsoe [I] shall send Yanky along with him I haveing noe more imployment for him here."
66,1,66,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,10/04/1682,Fort,RAC,"Your honours of the 6th of this instant I have received whereby I understand that my March accompts are allowed of, but stranges [strange is?] my canoe hyres are againe termed extravagant, seeing itt is your honours order I should give an account of what ships comes or passes att this place, which I hope your honour knowes I cannot doe without sending aboard and consequently charge itt to an account. I shall doe my endeavour to purchase what corne I can for Mr Shears at the rate of 2 angles per chest but the Blacks will not be att the charge of the canoe hyre for the interlopers pays 3 angles per chest now att this present both to windward and leward of this place. Pray send up the briganteen with the first oppertunity with those goods mentioned in my last of the 5th of this instant and lett the iron barrs be of the best sort, especially those that are marked.
PS. If your honour will lower the price of the red and blew cloath there is a probability to dispose of itt but not att the former rates."
67,1,67,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,n.d.,Fort,RAC,"Yours I have received and shall answer the particulars within this day or two, at present am not very well. I have desired all the sheets, Guyney stuffs and bassons, only the 6 pounders and blanketts excepted, from Mr Towgood with a condition to pay him in gold att delivering according to your rates, but ditto Towgood will not doe it. It is for the creditt of the factory if you order itt, if not patience itt is a sad thing that a factor cannot keepe that respect among the natives as ought to be for the Companys creditt."
68,1,68,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,01/06/1682,Fort,RAC,"Your honours dated the 30th May I have this day received and am certaine your honour hath done the Royall Company good service in lowering the perpetuanoes 1 angle per piece and I question not but I shall be able to dispose of a good quantity thereof att this place soe soone as the natives knowes our rates. Wherefore I desire your honour will be pleased to send mee upon account of the Royall Company 3 bailes of perpetuanoes, 2 cases or 40 pieces sayes, 10 barrells of powder, alsoe the 29 pieces niccanees for which I have given receipt, and this with the first conveniency of faire weather. If your honour pleases to order mee to buy corne att 3 angles per chest I am in hopes to gett 20 or 30 chests in readyness to be sent downe by the canoe that brings up the above mentioned goods. I would have sent your honour my last two months account but must begg some few dayes delay, I being att present under physick. I am inform'd of two English ships to windward, not knowing whether Companys ships or interlopers."
69,1,69,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,09/06/1682,Fort,RAC,"By the oppertunity of this seasonable weather I have sent my boatswaine express to your honour with my last months accounts of Aprill and May, as alsoe the ballance of the same to Mr Spurvay being 4 markes 9 angles and 3 tacco's of good gold. I designed to have sent up sooner but hath been hitherto disappointed by the vehement raines which have fal'n for some dayes and have soe imaged the seas that noe canoes durst hazard off till now. I have by this conveyance alsoe sent up a good man slave for account of the Royall Company for whome I desire a receipt. This faire weather continuing I desire your honour will be pleased to send mee for account of the Royall Company by first conveniency the goods mentioned in my last to your honour of the 1st of this instant by the which I alsoe desire to know if you might be pleased to order the buying of corne att 3 angles per chest, whereto I begg your honours answer. If you might be pleased to order the selling the blew pottkeys att 24 per bendy I may dispose of them all this being the rate of the Guyney stuffs which the blacks esteems att equall vallue with the pottkeys. I desire your honour will be pleased to send mee a booke for keeping my accompts as alsoe two or three quires of paper I haveing but very little or none att all. Here is in this road a small ship bound to the Bite, Evan Leyes Commander."
70,1,70,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,24/06/1682,Fort,RAC,"Be pleased to know that I am this day safe arrived here as likewise the 15 hand canoe whereout of I have received 6 pieces sayes, 75 pieces of perpetuano's, 10 barrells of powder, 50 iron barrs and 50 lead barrs and all for account of the Roy all Affrican Company. I desire your honour will be pleased to send mee by the said canoe for account of the Royall Company soe many iron barrs marked and of the best sort as the canoe conveniently can carry, as likewise 10 pewter juggs. I was this morning aboard the Dutch ships bound for Europe whereof I understand that there are two design'd to saile upon Monday next without faile, whereof one for Zealand and the other for Amsterdam, but they are absolutely ordered by the Generall of the Mine not to carry any letters for the English nation without his especiall order, but if your honour may be pleased to write under my covert I doubt not but itt shall have a safe conveyance. I have the Commanders promise for the safe conduct of my owne letters.
[PS] The St George is now in sight of this place."
71,1,71,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,02/07/1682,Fort,RAC,"Your honours of the 30th June by the 15 hand canoe I have received, as alsoe 225 iron barrs and 10 pewter juggs, for which I shall give the Company creditt. I have sent your honour according to order 5 chests of corne per the 15 hand canoe, alsoe a woeman slave for account of the Royall Company for which I desire a receipt. I have alsoe sent up one barrell of powder being damnified, desireing one in leiw thereof or a receipt for the same.
[PS] Tomorrow I shall send up my account with the ballance."
72,1,72,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,03/07/1682,Fort,RAC,"I have by this express sent your honour herein inclosed my June account with the ballance of the same to Mr Henry Spurvay amounting to 8 marks, 4 angles and 3 tacco's, whereof paid ditto Spurvay the 23rd of June 6 marks, 7 ounces, 12 angles and now per bearer 1 marke, 8 angles and 3 tacco's as per his receipts. Here is arrived to windward of this place one small Barbarian [sic: = Barbadian] interloper comeing from the Beneen and St Thoma, I suppose it may be Charles Langley. The damaged barrill of powder whereof I writt yesterday was forgott by the canoemen but shall be sent per first oppertunity."
73,1,73,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,05/07/1682,Fort,RAC,"Last night late I had advice from the Blacks of the arrivall of Captain Henry Nurse 
who lies now att Succondee. By the Blacks relation whoe hath been aboard, hee hath in his ship severall passingers, soe well factors as souldiers."
74,1,74,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,16/07/1682,Fort,RAC,"Your honours dated of the 14th instant I have received whereby I understand my Aprill and May accounts are received and allowed of, but am sorry your honour is displeased with my putting both months into one account, which was occasioned by my being one month at Capo Corsoe in the which time there was little money taken and that which I have sent up was taken after my returne with goods, but in obediencye to your honours commands shall for the future take care to charge every months accounts by itt selfe. I begg your honour would be pleased to send up the 3 bales of perpetuano's, 40 pieces sayes, 10 barrells powder which I writt for last for account of the Royall Company, for these I brought downe last are almost sold and the mony in cash. I alsoe desire you would be pleased to send mee for account of the Royall Company 500 iron barrs of the best sort and marked for I have still upward of 80 per remaines but cannot put them off because not marked.
[PS] Pray send good goods, alsoe a booke to keepe my accounts in per first, want them much."
75,1,75,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,17/07/1682,Fort,RAC,"Your honours of the 15 instant by the 15 hand canoe I have received, as alsoe 250 barrs of iron for which I shall give the Company creditt. According to order per returne of this canoe I send your honours 10 chests of corne. Charles Langley interloper lies to to windward of this place and is like to make but a bad markett of his Beneen cloaths and is in a very weake condition haveing only 5 whitemen aboard. Here is a small interloper from the West Indias, his name unknowne only hee hath served the Company formerly and now intends to settle at Quida. The Dutch interloper D Bruyne is alsoe here still.
[PS] I have alsoe sent per this canoe one man slave upon the Royall Company account for which I desire a receipt."
76,1,76,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,02/08/1682,Fort,RAC,"Upon receipt of your honours dated ultimo July I sent for Mr Langley and delivered in his owne hands your honours letter, upon perusall whereof hee declared himselfe happy in being capable to doe your honour any service which hee sayes hee can and will very freely doe in this affaire of Mr Buckham, which I beleeve hee can well doe haveing transported the said Mr Buckham, his wife, children, slaves and estate from the Beneen but complaines that hee dealt verry uncivilly by him after their comeing to St Thoma. I was very urgent with Mr Langley to have him come downe this day butt hee being troubled with a lameness and haveing some business to dispatch aboard humbly beggs your honours pardon for this dayes delay promiseing upon his faith and word to give his personall attendance tomorrow being the 3rd instant att Cabo Corsoe Castle.
[PS] Just now is arrived Mr Nightingale but soe ill disposed that hee could not write, yett hath spoke with Mr Langley about this affaire."
77,1,77,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,04/08/1682,Fort,RAC,"These are to acquaint your honour that since my returne hither I have still been verry ill disposed as to my health, wherefore begg some few dayes delay before I send up my monthly accompts, hopeing then to be in a better state of body then now and capable to write out my accompts which att present I cannot doe but hope in the mercy of God for a speedy recovery."
78,1,78,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,14/08/1682,Fort,RAC,"Itt haveing pleased God after a verry sore fitt of sickness to put mee in some way of recovery, although as yett I continue very weake and my health returns but slowly yett, I have endeavoured to draw up the last months accompt which I send your honour herein inclosed by this express of my boatswaine, as alsoe the ballance of the same to Mr Henry Spurvay being 4 marks, 7 ounces, 10 angles, 10 tacco's. Satureday night last came in this road Captain Andrews, Captain May and Captain Morphy, interlopers, they provided with all sorts of currant goods and takes a great deale of money and I to the contrary take not one cracra on shoare in the Company s factory."
79,1,79,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,17/08/1682,Fort,RAC,"Your honours of the 15th instant I have received. As to Agamaco's being sent to Aguaffo I wish itt may tend to the Companys profitt for truely, although I have hitherto consealed what I could of the knavery of these people of Little Commenda upon expectation of their amendment, but finding them dayly to be worse and worse I am now forced to acquaint your honour that the Royall Companys interest in this place is very much abused for they now openly doe what they please in laying out their mony in all ships and I can sell nothing here but what I must trust for 2 or 3 months before I can gett my money and they only looke upon us here as pledges for their security that noe harme may come to them aboard ship. And they not only refraine buying the Companys goods but now attempts the stealing thereof, as I have severall times found by the chalks wherewith the iron barrs were marked and after counting the same in presence of Captain Brackon and the Kings Mareen have found 48 barrs wanting soe that except other meanes be used soe well for advanceing the trade as secureing the Companys goods I shall grow scrupilous to take any longer charge of the Companys concerns here, feareing they may begin their old tricks in breaking open the warehouse and takeing the goods from thence. The bad money returned I have received and by this bearer have sent Mr Spurvay good money in leiu thereof, itt is my greate loss but occasioned by my sickness being unable to looke after itt my selfe."
80,1,80,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,19/08/1682,Fort,RAC,"After humbly begging your honours serious consideration of my last dated the 17th instant, these serves to acquaint your honour that last night about 9 of the clock there happened here some few houses to windward of the Royall Companys factory a most terrible and vehement fire which in the space of one halfe houre consumed above 60 houses but by the providence of God in calming the wind and our great industry in dethatching all the houses betwixt us and the fire which threatned any damage to our quarter [we] have, blessed be God, preserved the Royall Companys concerns from any damage of those threatning flames. The three interlopers are still in the roade corning and tradeing."
81,1,81,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,24/08/1682,Fort,RAC,"Your honours two letters of the 18th and 22nd instant I have received and according to order shall continue a good and faire correspondence with these people, the which hitherto I have done to my expences, although frustrate of my designe in advanceing the Royall Companys trade and interest, which they dayly more and more contemne by bringing all their goods from aboard ship and I have not taken one cracra since my last comeing from Cabo Corsoe and the money sent up last was for goods trusted out two months before and I truly beleeve soe long as there is a ship on this side Axim that they will buy none of the Companys goods, but I shall trust to your honours writting for redress of these wrongs by the first of the vessells that comes from leward. Whereas the King of Aguaffo's presence [pretence?] for conniveing with and assisting the rogues of Little Commenda in their villainy's only is my not duely paying his customes this I can prove to be a false untruth by Captain Brackon and the Mareen, whoe have received the customs off my hands and carryed them up to him att the time agreed upon by contract. The Feteras custome I had hitherto detained upon account of the two slaves, but since the receipt of your Honours letter have sent him one peece of perpetuanoe with half an anchor of brandy, soe that they are wholly paid one years custome."
82,1,82,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,01/09/1682,Fort,RAC,"Your honours ultimo August I have received whereby I understand your honours order for removeing the Royall Companys factory from this place which shall in all points to the uttmost of my power punctually be obeyed soe soone as the briganteen is arrived here. The people here are soe refractory against our removing that they will give noe assistance in carrying the goods to the waterside, therefore desire your honour will be pleased to send up one of the big canoes with 5 or 6 slaves for carrying the goods to the waterside, otherwise itt will be impossible to gett the iron barrs off. Your honour has not been pleased to mention anything in the letter about David Harper or the flagg. If my small advice might be accepted I think itt fitt that the flagg may be left for the keeping the Royall Companys possession and that David Harper may come up with the goods, itt being impossible for a whiteman to stay here after the factory's removeall, but desire your honours answer therein which in this and all other things shall be obeyed. I desire your honour would send one of your Cabosheers whoe may see the removal and take notice of what pallavora either transactions may be occasioned by the natives soe well that your honour may understand rightly all the business. I desire a speedy answer."
83,1,83,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,08/09/1682,Fort,RAC,"Your honours of the 2d instant by Cabosheire Aggamaco with the 5 hand canoe, as alsoe one of this instant by Docter Griffins boy I have received. The reason I did not answer your Honours by Aggamaco before now was my dayly expecting Mr Towgoods arrivall here and soe after speedy imbarquing of the Royall Companys concerns att this factory in person to have given your honour a true and reale account of all affaires att this place. This accompany's Aggamaco whoe I have sent up by a 2 hand canoe to give your honour a full relation of what hath past here since his comeing to Commenda, and truly I have peremptoryly obeyed your orders in keeping a good correspondence with the natives, soe that there is noe pallavora here nor anything to be pretended in prejudice of the Royall Company's interest or my own person, soe that I doubt not, the ship once arrived, but with creditt to my masters the Royall Affrican Company of England to bring of all the concerns att this factory, which in this and all others shall be obeyed by [James Nightingale].
PS. I heare noe news from the windward; Pray dispatch Aggamaco against the ships arrivall."
84,1,84,James Nightingale,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,10/09/1682,Fort,RAC,"Your honours of the 9th instant I have received and am sorry you are pleased to terme my letter frivilous, itt being soe full an answer to your honours of the 8th instant as I att that time could give. Whereas your honour takes itt ill my putting the Royall Company to the charge of the 2 hand canoe, my intention therein was for the best, for understanding your Honour was soe earnest to know how all affaires stood here I thought itt fitt besides my writting to send up Aggamaco whoe might give your honour a personall accompt how affaires stood here as to the Royall Companys concerns.
Last night came here the Kings man desireing Captain Bracon and mee up to Aguaffoe that hee might understand the reason of our removeing but I sent word that my business here was to looke after my masters concerns and if hee had any thing to say to the Royall Affrican Company that hee must have his recourse to Cabo Corsoe. I have formerly writt your honour my opinion about leaveing the fllagg for keeping the Royall Companys possession, concerning which I desire your pleasure as alsoe your honours order for bringing up David Harper, for as yett I have received noe particular order concerning either of them. To the 5 hand canoemen I have paid canky money hitherto, I desire to know if your honour will allow of the continuance thereof while they are here.
I desire your honour to send mee for accompt of the Royall Affrican Company 10 gallons of brandy. I have sent a case to putt itt in and will be att the charge of canoe hyre myselfe. There is an interloper to windward att Dickiscove."
85,1,85,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,10/01/1683,Fort,RAC,"Immediatly after my arrivall here with Docter Griffin wee sent up your honours dasheys to the King and Fettera, and have alsoe disposed of the other two cases and anchor of brandy to the Cappusheers and merchants of Commenda, for which they all render your honour hearty thanks, as alsoe for your honours care in preserving the English's interest in this place. The Cappusheers promise with all care and speed to goe about building the Royall Company's factory. The Dutch have here three whitemen besides the Cheife, and have been very large both in their brandy and customes, as Griffin can give your honour an account, which is the reason the people are somewhat urgent for their customes according to contract. Att settling Captain Bracon desires your honour would send up by his owne canoe 25 blew and 15 green perpettuanoes for account of the Royall Company and att the months end moneyes shall be sent downe for the goods that may be disposed of with an account of the remaines soe well of the goods formerly brought up by himselfe as of what may be consign'd to this place for the future."
86,1,86,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,16/01/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your Honours of the 11th instant with the 40 pieces perpetuano's and brandy consigned to Captain Bracon came safe to hand. These may acquaint your honour that the Cabbisheers are very eager to goe about the building and have been two dayes att worke in breaking of earth for the worke, but they declare themselves unable to goe about the walls without the assistance of some better workeman than any att this place, which I understand by Captain Bracon to be the truth for although hee hath soe many slaves of his owne yett the building his house cost him one bendy to an Fanteener who he brought from Fanteen to direct and oversee his worke, wherefore if your honour be pleased that this building be brought to any perfection before the raines itt will be verry fitt that two or three men that have knowledge in building be provided and sent up with speed. The Fanteeners are said to be the best workemen, whereof there lives one with Captain Cooffy whoe knows his business verry well and may serve your honour in this affaire.
The Dutch Copeman is very busie in provideing for his building, hee hath gott a sloopes loading of timber from Shuma and hath here a carpenter a makeing of doors and windows. Hee expects to have his house up in six weeks for hee is to have 20 slaves from the Mina, hee will make his house two storyes high with only foure large roomes, two below and two above, the whole length 59 foot and 18 foot broad, the walls two foot thick. The goods the Dutch have here are sayes, iron barrs and perpetuano's which hee sells at 9a per piece, brandy, and Beneen cloaths. The Copeman tells mee hee hath found but small trade since his comeing, which hee does not much notice soe long as there are noe goods att the Mina to supply him with but soe soone as supplyes come, which are dayly expected by foure ships from Europe, hee expects to have a considerable trade though little to his masters profitt for hee says that by his brothers order hee will undersell all ships that comes in the road, they selling soe cheape as they will. The trade is but little att present, which is the reason that the boysado's and perpettuanoes remaine unsold, but Captain Bracon desires mee to acquaint your honour that there is some probability in selling the perpettuanoes as likewise a considerable quantity more before any ships come downe to hinder the trade, for he sayes that soe long as your honour will sell the Royall Companys goods att the same rates the Dutch does that they shall have but little trade in such goods as your Honour consignes to this place, which truely I verryly beleeve hee haveing the whole trade of the place in his hands. Upon Fryday last there was 4 interlopers in this roade, their names I can give your honour noe accoount of for the Blacks could only tell mee that they were English ships and interlopers, they are all gon to leward, soe that the roade is att present altogether without shipping though I doe not know how long for I am informed that Captain How with two more are to windward. I have alsoe had notice by a canoe that came from windward that upon Sunday last Captain Shears had gott no higher then Cape Trespointas."
87,1,87,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,19/01/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your honours of the 17th instant I have received. In answer as to the building the factory [I] must acquaint your Honour that except people expert in building be sent up the worke will never be accomplished, for the people here will know noe pathern nor draught, but will make a house to their owne minds, which I see by their cutting of the halfe from the first draught, and what they build the walls does not exceed one foot thickness which I told them was but laboure in vaine, whereto they answered that if your honour sent up any here there should be noe want of earth to build with, but for themselves they know not to manage soe greate a worke as the draught of that factory is.
As to account of goods consigned to Captain Bracon be pleased to know that the 6 chests of sheets are only sold, which hee saies hee bought of your honour att 4a per chest, which comes to in all Mk 3, the which sume of 3 markes hee hath sent your honour per the bearer in good gold for account of the Royall Company desireing a receipt for the same.
The boysadoes and perpetuanoes remaine entire and not sold, neither can hee put off the perpettuanoes att 10a per piece, but saith if your honour will consider that this is the place where all goods are sold cheaper then to leward and abate 1 angle upon the perpettuanoes hee can immediatly dispose of what are here and doe the Company service in disposing of a considerable quantity more in a short time. Hee also desires your Honour to abate him 1 peaze upon each chest of sheets, if granted hee desires 10 chests may be sent up for account of the Royall Company. The marchants do not denie the payment of one piece of sletia and halfe an anchor of brandy, to which I myselfe was wittness at Mr Nightingals settleing, but they demand itt againe as due once a yeare."
88,1,88,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,24/01/1683,Fort,RAC,"This weeke merchants being come downe Captain Bracon hath disposed of 36 pieces of the Roy all Company s perpettuanoes att 10 angles per piece, the 4 pieces remaining being a little damaged will not goe off here. The 36 pieces perpettuanoes sold att 10a per piece amounts to 2 marks, 6 ounces, 8 angles, which I have sent your Honour in good gold for account of the Roy all Company, alsoe 6 angles more that Captain Bracon was owing upon account of the sheets, amounting in all to 2 marks, 6 ounces and 14 angles, for which I desire a receipt. Soe there remaines att present in the hands of Captain Bracon only the 8 pieces boysado's, and if your honour will soe order itt the 4 pieces perpettuanoes shall be return'd to Cabo Corsoe per first conveniency. Captain Bracon desires your honour will be pleased to send up per first oppertunity for account of the Roy all Company 10 chests of sheets, with 30 blew and 30 green perpetuano's, which if sent up with speed will undoubtably have some vent, there being noe ships here att present. Bracon desires to acquaint your honour that hee is a looser in 5 angles which hee paid for canoe hyre for bringing up the last sheets, but hopes your honour will prevent the same for the future by sending the goods up in the Royall Companys canoes, alsoe by encouraging him according to desert for what service he may doe the Royall Company att this place, especially now when the Dutch are labouring soe much to gett him to their side but I hope shall not prevaile. I humbly begg your honour might be pleased to allow some brandy to be spent, for the people does expect itt where the Company goods are sold. In this and what else does concerne myselfe I trust wholy to your honours goodness and pleasure. Since the receipt of your honours last letter I have had two meeting with the Cabosheers of Commenda about the building of the Companys factory and they absolutely declare themselves uncapable to undertake the worke with fewer then three workmen from Cabo Corsoe for building the walls, which if complyed with itt will be necessary they be sent up with speede soe the raines may not againe prevent the worke"
89,1,89,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,26/01/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your honours of the 25th instant I have received, alsoe the 60 pieces perpetuano's and 10 chests of sheets consigned to Captain Bracon are come safe to hand. Here are att present severall merchants from the country, soe Bracon expects that the perpetuano's this day received may be disposed of by tomorrow night. Wherefore Captain Bracon desires your honour would be pleased to send him with all possible speede for account of the Royall Company 100 pieces green and blew perpetuano's, 40 pieces sayes, and 10 barrells powder. These goods Captain Bracon desires to be here against tomorrow night or Sunday morning att farthest, for the merchants are in great hast to be gon againe to the country. I humbly thank your honour in that you have been pleased to allow us here 6 gallons brandy per month to be spent upon the Royall Company's accompt, I have sent per this canoe one empty anchor containing 6 gallons which I hope your honour will cause to be filled and sent up for accompt of the ensueing month. Paper, pen and inke is very scarce with mee, which I hope your Honour will be pleased to supply. I desire the prizes of the sayes and powder."
90,1,90,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,28/01/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your honours of the 27th instant I have received. The 100 pieces perpetuano's and 40 pieces sayes, with the 6 gallons brandy for the factory's use are all come safe to Captain Bracons hands. I have sent you per bearer for account of the Royall Company 4 marks, 5 ounces, and 8 angles, which is the just sume of the 60 perpettuanoes last received amounts to. The perpetuanoes this day received will immediatly be sold, wherefore Captain Bracon desires your honour would be pleased to send him more for account of the Royall Company 100 pieces blew and green perpetuano's with the 10 barrells powder last writt for with its price. Hee desires likewise if itt may please your Honour to lett him have 50 pieces of the now writt for perpetuanoes at 9a per piece, which hee intends to send up in the country upon his own account soe that hee may gett some profitt by them for himselfe. I see but little probability for building the factory this season, for the blacks sayes plainely they will not undertake such a building except your honour send people up to build itt, as alsoe the raines will goe neare to be a greate hinderance to itt. Captain Bracon humbly desires you would cause Oliver the blacksmith to make him a grapline of two iron barrs for a 9 hand canoe, the barrs hee desires may be placed to his account."
91,1,91,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,30/01/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your honours of the 29th instant I have received. The 100 pieces of perpetuano's and 10 barrells powder consigned to Captain Bracon hee hath alsoe received. I would according to your honours commands have sent an account of the goods received, sold and remaines thereof per this conveniency but am resolved about the last of the weeke to come downe myselfe to Cabo Corsoe, to know your Honours mind about building the factory in some particulars, att which time I shall satisfie your honour as to that account and bring with mee what gold Captain Bracon hath gott in cash."
92,1,92,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,08/02/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your honours of the 7th instant I have received, in answer whereof your honour may be pleased to know that I can by noe meanes perswade Captain Bracon to come downe to Cabo Corsoe at this time, his reasons are the great pallavoras that are up in the country att present, and that hee will not stir abroad before hee heares the effects thereof. Likewise hee complaines that hee cannot goe abroad without a greate charge in expences, as hee found by experience when hee was last at Cabo Corsoe. As to the particulars of agreeing with Bracon about commission of goods sold by him hee demands 1 peaze per marke soe well for the goods already sold as that may be sold for the future; I begg a line in answer whereby I may give him an account if your Worship does comply with his demands, alsoe if what you are pleased to allow him shall be deteyned here in his owne hands or sent up from Cabo Corsoe upon receipt of what moneys he sends downe. I have herewith sent your honour the Tanton Querrey account which those people acknowledged to be owing in presence of the Quarranteer and Captain Peeter. There is noe trade att present by reason of those outfallings in Abraboe, however Captain Bracon hath some mony in cash which hee hath taken for sheets and shall send itt downe per next. Mr Towgood finds alsoe but small trade here. As to account of shiping here or to windward I referr itt to Captain Shears."
93,1,93,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,12/02/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your honours of the 8th instant by Docter Griffin I have received. As to the palavora with Abracon hee doe faithfully promise to advance the Royall Companys trade and maintaine their interest in this place. As to the commission money Captain Bracon stood hard upon 3 angles but by much perswasions have brought him to except of 2 angles per marke, which hee expects your honour will be pleas'd to send him from Cabo Corsoe for all the money that hath been taken since the goods were first consign'd to him and soe once a month for the future. Bracon hath sent downe by Docter Griffin 5 marks, 10 angles of good gold for account of the Royall Company, which payes for the 10 chests of sheets last sent up; Hee desires your honour would send him more for account of the Royall Company 10 chests of sheets with 1 anchor of brandy for this months allowance with one halfe anchor which Docter Griffin borrowed of him. The trade is but bad at present. Last night came in this roade a small ship with Companys jack and pendant but I have understood that hee is an interloper bound to the Bite."
94,1,94,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,16/02/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your honours of the 14th instant with the brandy therein mentioned I have received. I am sorry your honour can spare Abracon noe more sheets, for the goods that are here yeilds noe money att present, they being soe much undersold aboard by Captain Price and Boles whoe sells their sayes att 13 and perpettuanoes att 9 angles per piece. Yesterday morning Captain Bracon with the rest of the merchants of this place went up to Aguaffoe being sitted [= cited] by the King upon account of a pallavora caused by the Arcanies of Little Commenda, whoe are alsoe there and threaten to leave the country because the merchants here will not suffer them to goe aboard and buy their goods themselves. It is said that the Dutch have complained of the small trade hee finds here, alsoe that the merchants slights his goods and have bought the Royall Companys goods out of Abracons hands, likewise [they complained] against them goeing aboard. What effects these pallavoras will take I can give your honour noe account before Captain Bracons return. Last night came in this road a small interloper whose Commander Bennitt dyed att Cape Trespointas, shee is now commanded by one Rolands who was Docter and part owner."
95,1,95,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,23/02/1683,Fort,RAC,"This goes by Captain Bracons canoe by whome hee hath sent 1 marke, 4 ounces, 3 angles, good gold, for which hee desires your honour would please to send him 3 chests of sheets. Captain Bracon with the rest of the merchants of this place returned from Aguaffoe upon Wednesday night, by whome I understand the King hath given free leave to the three Cheife of the Arcanies to goe aboard ship and trade, which is a great signe of the little regard the King carry's to the factory's that are kept here. The Dutch Copeman hath left off his building a mud house and is now dayly with the King to suffer him to build a stone house, how his desire will be complyed with I know not, but am of opinion that hee shall hardly gett a house to live in this raines. Tradeing is soe dead that Bracon cannot put off any of the Royall Companys goods at present. There is noe news of any shiping to windward. Captain Price and Boles are still in this roade."
96,1,96,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,24/02/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your honours two severall letters of the 23rd instant I have received. The 3 chests of sheets Captain Bracon hath received, acknowledging himselfe greatly bound to your honours favour in letting him have them att the former price, the which favour hee promised to recompence in his fidility in the Royall Company's concerns. As to a further account of the palavora att Aguaffoe be pleased to know that the Arcanies complaints have been very great against the people of Little Commenda, especially for pulling up their fittishes and throwing them in the sea, for which act the King hath prendeed the Commenda Cabosheers in 2 bendy's of gold. Captain Bracon was hard against their goeing aboard, alsoe Aban from the Mina told the King itt was the Generalls desire that none of the Arcanies should be tollerate to goe aboard, notwithstanding all this hee has given free leave to the three Cheife of the Arcany's to trade aboard ship. The Arcanies are all to returne hither tomorrow. The Dutch is verry busie pulling downe all his former worke, for a little money gott leave of the King to build a stone house, which hee intends to goe about with all expedition."
97,1,97,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,02/03/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your Honours of the 26th February I have received and have made all possible enquirey after the sorts and quantities of goods brought over by the Dutch Company ship last arrived, yett can attain noe possitive account of the same, only the goods that are come are currant goods, but in quantity far short of expectation, the whole cargoe not exceeding 5000 prime cost. The two ships that went downe yesterday are expected to have better cargoes then the first, the Copeman here received yesterday a fresh supply of sheets, sayes and perpettuanoes. Captain Bracon desires to acquaint your Honour that tradeing is soe very dead at this place that there is not the least enquirey made after the Royall Company goods now in his hands, but if your Honour will lett him have sheets at the former price of 32 per benda he desires 10 or 12 chests may be sent up by the first conveyance, not doubting but they may goe off by degrees in the intrime that other goods lyes dead."
98,1,98,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,02/03/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your Honours of the 1st instant I have received, and have acquainted Captain Bracon, with the great supply of all sorts of goods brought to Cabo Corso by the Royall Company ship last arrived, of which goods he knows none to be a comodity here at present, only sheets excepted, which if your Honour will lett him have att 32 per benda as formerly, he will endeavour to dipose of 10 or 12 chests if sent up per the first conveyance, but at 28 per benda he will take none, the Dutch selling them also at the same rate of 32. Bracon desires to know how the broad and narrow niccanees and tapseels are sold in the Castle, and if he likes of their prices will take some quantity of each sort.
Since the sheets have been sold Bracon hath not taken one benda of gold for any of the Royall Companys goods that are in his hands, which proceeds from the deadness of trade, as also being dayly undersold by interlopers whoe sells their sayes att 12 and perpettuanoes att 08a each. Here is noe news of any ships to windward."
99,1,99,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,05/03/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your Honours of the 3rd instant I have received and have perused Captain Bracons account, which I find cleare and without mistake or error. The mony sent to Capo Corso by him comes in all Mk 23 3o 8a and just payes for the goods sold vizt 1040 sheets at 32 per benda and 196 perpettuanoes att 10a per peice. The goods remayn ing unsold are 104 perpettuanoes, 40 pieces sayes, 10 barrells powder and 8 pieces boysadoes. Captain Bracon desires your Honour will send him for account of the Roy all Company 6 chests of sheets and 170 4 pound basons with their prices as they are sold in the Castle. Here waits a merchant for the basons therefore they are desired with hast. Bracon also desires the monthly allowance of brandy may be sent up, for which he hath sent a casque containing 6 gallons. I am informed by the merchants that sayes begins to goe well of in the country. Perpettuanoes are like to be noe such comodity as formerly. This morning Captain Boles departed this road. There is noe news of any shipping to windward."
100,1,100,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,07/03/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your Honours of the 6th instant I have received. The 6 chests of sheets and 199 [var. 169] 41b basons with 6 gallons brandy factoryes use consigned to Captain Bracon he hath also received. I have acquainted Captain Bracon with your desire, and if the boysadoes and other goods [stay?] in his hands, whereto he answers that it is his none of his fault that merchants doe not buy the goods of him, also that the road hath not been cleare of shipping in a long time till now, whoe have very much undersold the Companys prices, but he desires your Honours patience till the end of this month, and if the boysadoes doe not goe off before, that he will pay for them himselfe and also give your Honour his advice what hopes may be for disposing of the rest of the goods, for he sayes the Dutch and blacks will looke upon as a great affront put upon him to withdraw the goods soe long as he thinkes himselfe capable to make them good upon all accounts and also to put them of when oppertunity offers. Bracon desires the prices of the narrow niccanees and tapseels, and if likes of their prices he thinkes they may yeald present mony."
101,1,101,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,09/03/1683,Fort,RAC,"By this express Captain Bracon hath sent downe for account of the Royall Company 3 marks 2 ounces good gold, whereof 1 marke 3 ounces payes for the 8 pieces of boysadoes, and 1 marke 7 ounces for the 10 barrells of powder, the boysadoes he hath paid with his owne mony. Bracon desires your Honour would please to send him for account of the Royall Company and with the first conveyance 12 barrells of powder, the halfe of the powder is desired in halfe barrells, also the prices of the narrow niccanees and tapseels as formerly desired.
[PS] Bracon desires your Honour would send him on account of the Royall Company a paire of scales and weights, for he finds himselfe a looser by his takeing mony on his small scales and weights."
102,1,102,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,11/03/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your Honours of the 10th instant with 12 barrells powder consigned to Captain Bracon are well received. I have also received a line from Mr Spurvay complaining of the scarceness of the weight of the money sent downe, which Bracon takes to be very strange since there is not a parcell of mony sent downe but he puts 2 angles upon it to make it the better weight at Capo Corso, wherefore he desires your Honour againe to send him up a poyle of scales and weights whereby he may both take and pay his mony. Otherwise he sayes his comission will not make the difference of the weight of the mony good betwixt what he receives and payes. The goods in the Dutch factory before the arrivall of the last ship where [= were] iron barrs, Beneen clouts, a few perpettuanoes and brandy, since he hath received 7 cases of sayes, 2 bales of perpettuanoes, 5 cases of fine sletias, 6 chests of sheets, 2 chests of carabines and firelocks with 4 halfe chests of beads, whereof he hath sold a good quantity of sayes (which is the reason those of the Royall Company goes of soe slowly, the blacks having alwayes a better opinion of the Dutch then English sayes). He hath also sold all his carbines and firelocks, with most of his beads, the rest of the goods doe not goe off but are like to lye upon his hands. Upon Fryday last came here Abraham [sic: = Aban] of the Mina in his returne from Abramboe when he had made an end of all palaveras, he had a palavera with the people of Little Commenda wherein he desired their care of the Generalls brother with an advancing of his trade.
Since the writing of the above is the Dutch Copeman gone to the Mina being written by an express from his brother."
103,1,103,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,18/03/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your Honours of the 16th instant with the box of scales and 4 ounces poyle of weights I have received. I have acquainted Captain Bracon with your Honours order for selling the sayes att 15 angles each, which he sayes will give the merchants more encouragement to buy the Royall Company goods. Upon Thursday last came to this road Captain Haywood from London, interloper, he reports that some 12 dayes agoe upon his departure from Abbeny that Captain Rickards arrived there. The Dutch fiscall went yesterday to windward, there being one of their Companys ships arrived at Axime.
Last night the Dutch Copeman received an express from the Generall ordering him to resigne his warehouse to his second and to repaire with all his own concernes to the Mina, in order to his goeing Copeman to Accra, the ship Affrica at the Mina waiting only for his transportation theither."
104,1,104,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,27/03/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your Honours of the 26th instant I have received. The reason of my not writing till now was I understood your Honour had advice of the Roy all Company s ships being in this road, also there being noe trade on shoure since the ships arrivall soe there affords nothing elce worth the advising. Captain Low is still here and hath sent his pinke to windward with what goods he knew might be most vendible, he intends to fall downe to Capo Corso tomorrow. Captain Bracon hath betwixt 5 and 6 marks in cash, which he promises (after he hath made up his accounts) to send downe on Fryday or Saterday without faile. As to what goods may vend best here, can give your Honour noe certaine account till the merchants have disposed the goods they have upon hand from aboard ship, but afterwards shall not faile to acquaint your Honour what goods are most desired.
[PS] Captain Bracon sayes the narrow niccaness will yeald noe more then 3 angles here and narrow tapseels 4 angles per piece, at which prices if your Honour will send up 100 pieces of each he will endeavour to dispose of them."
105,1,105,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,30/03/1683,Fort,RAC,"By this express Captain Bracon hath sent your Honour for account of the Royall Company 6 marks, 8 angles good gold. The goods sold are as followeth vizt

Captain Bracon desires your Honour might please to send him per bearer his comission mony for what mony he hath heitherto sent downe, which comes in all 32 marks 6 ounces, soe that his comission mony that is due to him at 2a per marke comes to 4 ounces, 1 angle and 6 taccoes. The King and Fetera, also the old and young Cappusheers of Little Commenda doe demand their customes as due at putting the corne in the ground. Captain Bracon is very earnest it may be paid them, for he sayes if their brandy which is due be paid at this time they will not expect their other customes before the dancing times. There is now due in brandy to the King and Fetera each 1 anchor and to the old and young Cappusheers each 1 halfe anchor, in all 3 anchors. I desire if it might please your Honour to send up the brandy with the 6 gallons for next months factories use in a quarter casque and the caske shall be return'd by the canoe that brings it up, for I could gett noe anchors to send downe. The Kings man waites here for his portion of it. If your Honour will lett Bracon have the narrow niccanees and tapseels the one at 3a and the other att 4a per piece he desires 100 pieces of each may be sent up. There lyes one Portugueze ship at Tacarada loaden with Brazeele tobaco, suger and rum, he hath a good markett for his tobaco and sells it at 4 lb per angle to the blacks. There is also two English interlopers at Dickecove."
106,1,106,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,06/04/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your Honours of the 30th March I have received and have acquainted Captain Bracon with the bad weight of the money sent last downe, which seemes strange to him, however is well satisfied that the Royall Company is paid out of his commission money and renders your Honour hearty thanks for the remainder which hee hath received being 3 ounces, 10 angles, 7 tacco's, which payes him for all the money hitherto sent to Cabo Corsoe by him. Bracon desires the grapling which your honour ordered to be made for him may be sent up for hee much wants itt and hath sent this canoe express for the same. I have sent downe 2 empty anchors desireing itt may please your Honour to order the brandy for the old and young Cabasheers customes and the 6 gallon's factory's allowance to be sent up in the same by this conveyance. Here is in this roade Captain Summervill interloper, alsoe the Portuguze. Tradeing is verry dead and but little money a stirring either ashoare or aboard. I humbly beg itt may please your honour to order the sending up my sallary now due per bearer for I verry much want itt, haveing been here the 8th of this instant 3 full yearly months, alsoe humbly entreating your Honour would consider that my liveing is fair more chargeable then att Cabo Corsoe and accordingly to grant some advancement of sallary, but in this as in all others I wholly trust to your honours goodness and pleasure."
107,1,107,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,12/04/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your Honours of the 11th instant with Abracons grapline and the 12 gallons brandy are well received. In answer to your honours concerning the trade here and shipping to windward be pleased to know that here hath been here no country merchants in 3 weeks either Arcanys or Quiffers soe that there are noe goods sold and all things verry dead as to tradeing. Yesterday came in the road Captain Thompson interloper, hee hath a verry great Gold Coast cargoe but hitherto hath had but a bad trade. Hee reports that Captain Pearson is to windward and may be expected here in a few dayes, hee hath a great ship of 46 guns and a cargoe of 12,000 pounds. There are alsoe three Dunkerkers to windward of 20 or 24 guns apeece."
108,1,108,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,18/04/1683,Fort,RAC,"Captain Bracon desires if itt may please your honour to send him for account of the Roy all Affrican Company 10 chests sheets, for the 3 chests last remayning are sold and greater probabillity for selling some sheets then any other commodyty att this present dead time. Captain Sommevill is still in this roade and takes but verry little money's. There are two Dutch interlopers awatering att Cape Trespunctas. Itt is reported alsoe that there is an English ship att Axim but uncertain whether Companys ship or interloper."
109,1,109,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,21/04/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your honours of the 18th instant I have received. The 10 chests sheets consign'd to Captain Bracon hee also received from aboard the sloope. Abracon hath sent your honour by Mr Towgood for accompt of the Royall Company 2 marks, 5 ounces, 6 angles 10 tacco's in good gold, the goods sold are these vizt 3 chests sheets containing 195 pieces att 28 per bendy, lm 5o 14a 10; 12 peeces perpettuano's att 10a per piece -:7:8:- [making] 2: 5: 6: 10. The reason why sayes and perpettuanoes lyes here upon hand is because there comes noe merrchants neither Arcany's nor any other to buy them and I doubt not but your Honour verry well knowes that is the cheife cause that tradeing is soe dead alongst the whole coast."
110,1,110,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,26/04/1683,Fort,RAC,"Upon Monday last the slaves of this place being according to custome gon for water, news was brought that they were panyard by one of the Kings couzens whoe lives neareby, whereupon the Cabosheers went out to know the matter but found only the Arcany slaves carried away, whereupon they sent for this person but [he] refuseing to come in, some arm'd men went out and tooke him and sett his croome on fire, alsoe wounded severall of his men whereof 2 freemen are dead. Upon this wrong the friends of this Kings couzen whoe are many and strong in Aguaffoe threatens to come down and be reveng'd of Commenda by setting itt on fire. The King for makeing up the pallavora hath sent for the Cabosheers and Arcany's, whoe went up last night, and Abracon is now departed thither whose desire is for the more security of the Royall Company's concerns that your honour would upon receipt hereof send a Cabasheer with the Companys caine to the King of Aguaffoe warning him that hee take great care noe harme be don to Little Commenda, but especially to the house of Captain Abracon, where now there is such a considerable quantity of the Royall Companys concerns, as also to dispatch Captain Bracon with hast to looke after the same in such a troublesome time, alsoe if the Royall Company sustaine any damage that itt will lye upon his head to make itt good according to contract. This in great hast."
111,1,111,David Harper,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,05/06/1683,Fort,RAC,"Last night one of Aguaffoe Cabosheers with his souldiers being here, some of his people having taken a corrall necklace from Captain Coffee's boy our people reprehended him therefore, whereupon hee immediately discharg'd some shott and threatened to kill and plunder all, soe that Bracon put his men in armes but ere they were gott ready the rogue comes againe and fires a great many shott into Captain Bracons court, there stood amongst the rest of the people, soe that a great many were wounded whereof my boy the boatswaine was one, whoe I have sent downe by the canoe hopeing your honour will order his wounds to be cured, but after Bracons people were gott ready they fought a long time ere our people gott them driven out of the towne. Some hours afterwards our people went out and fought him againe soe that hee fled. There is 6 of our people kill'd and a great many wounded. How itt will goe still is uncertaine, there being noe people come from the King as yett. The Mareens croome is all burnt off. I shall waite your honours orders in this sad distress, for neither the Companys goods nor our lives are safe att present. The Generall of the Mina hath sent up Aban with some great canoes and Cabosheers here to looke after his factory, but hath as yett given noe orders to withdraw. Your honours immediat commands are expected."

After the dispatch of the 9 hand canoe I went two severall times to the waterside with Captain Bracon thinking to have brought him with mee to Cabo Corsoe, but the Kings people would not suffer us to goe off, for they come downe hourly promiseing that this day people shall come to make pallavora's with him and give him all desired satisfaction for his staying and the factory's being continued, whereupon Captain Bracon hath perswaded mee to waite for your honours answer of this one letter, wherein I desire your honours express order if I shall immediatly come downe to Cabo Corsoe, leaving Abracon here, or if I shall stay longer to heare the pallavora's, and if in case Bracon getts satisfaction soe that hee stayes if I shall put up the flagg againe and continue, for I find Bracon inclines to staying, although I doe what I can to perswade him itt will be better to make his pallavora's at Cabo Corsoe then here, but hee tells mee that if hee leave the place the Cabosheers of Aguaffoe will turne the King out, seeing the trouble came by one of his couzens. If your Honour inclines to keepe the place itt will not be amiss to send up to Aguaffoe desireing gold pawnes for the future security of the Roy all Company s factory and Bracons person, or elce such men pawnes as shall be approven of by Captain Bracon, likewise to deliver Akasy in Bracons hands (for wee understand that the King of Fetue hath offered to deliver him for a little money), alsoe to turne his couzen Taggee out of the country. These are the conditions Bracon desires, otherwayes hee will leave the place, all the best of his things being gon and the great canoe lying here ready with the rest, for hee hath not left a doore nor window in his house. The goods for which Bracon remaines debter are 10 chests sheets, 4 barrells powder, 13 pieces perpettuanoes and 15 pieces sayes. If your honour shall please to order mee downe before Bracon can come along with mee to give satisfaction for the goods sold by him, hee proffers to send his cheife wife with mee to remayne till hee comes himselfe, whereunto I also desire your honours particular order; I only keepe the 3 hand canoe till I receive your Honours commands. Mr Towgood came in the roade today and waites for orders, the goods being already gon. I humbly begg your honours immediate particular answer to these concerns which shall be punctually obeyed."

I would desire you not to forgett to send a caske of brandy, for hee will be verry much want of itt, and to send mee prizes of all goods and all necessary things belonging and necesssary for the factory, as both weights and scales, paper and what may be usefull. Here is a greate many men stayes here for goods, and there is noe ship here but one interloper up to windward, and the sooner the better to have goods here.

The Captain of the Arcany's is att the charge of sending a canoe for some goods and would desire you to send what you can besides, as you find conveniency, for here is a greate many traiders come downe [so] that if wee had goods wee should have a greate trade. If you send powder if itt be 20 barrells wee need not house itt, and other goods may sell a greate deale, for the Captain of the Arcany's saith that hee will keepe all the money for mee to take if I can possible have goods for him, for hee professes greate kindness to mee."

I would desire you to lett mee know the proportion and all concerns as to the contract and I shall act accordingly. In the meane time I have lett them know, that in the meane time while the house is getting ready they shall be supplyed with goods according to your letter, and att the present by this bearer they have sent money for 10 barrells of powder, which they would desire to have tomorrow morning if possible, in one bulce 5 marks and 7 peaze, the other bulce 5 ounces and 1 peaze.

Inclosed is a coppye for what slaves and corne Captain Rickard had here. The Arcanies wantes more sheets and of the largest sort of sletias; they will give but 6a for the smallest sorte. If your Honour will send some good sheets, large sletias, green and blew perpettuanes, broad tapseeles, narrow niccanees, or what your Honour will please to spare.
[PS] Two dayes since I received a noate from Captain Starland and he sayeth hopeth to gett all his shells in this weeke, but sayeth that one of the canoemen was run away but he hath gott another there. There is an Arda missing, one Quonnu, the people saye he is at Fetue."
242,1,242,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,21/10/1681,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday I received two of yours, and as to the slaves being at Ashams croome I have sent twice, at night and in the day; and if should heare where they were would get them secured, but every one thinks if in any of these parts, they are at Abbra, which entertaines all vaggabones and runnawayes for souldiers. If Mr Richards per thee Curranteer have any interest with them, if in these parts [they] must be theire. As concerning the fort at Anamaboe I beleeve there be 4 peeces of sayes dew, when the other 2 flankers are built, and as yet their is but one built, and that was the reason Agent Bradley put them off; they need not aske for the old Braffoes debts for he owes the Company 16 slaves he gott of Mr Pysing at once beside others things, and there was severall writings drawne in Mr Belwood and Mr Pysings time which come to little effect, and when they gett goods in theire hands I am afraid [they] will play the rogue as all of their collour will doe.
[PS] To morrow God willing I intend to send the Arders by land, for if should send them by sea, they would thinke I send them aboard of ship."
243,1,243,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,22/10/1681,Fort,RAC,"This comes by the Arda slaves which came from Capo Corsoe formerly thought [= though] can be very ill spared; but hope your Honour will send John Rattlife and Awinna Quidda per first conveniency, for have here but few hands both of whites and blackes. Inclosed is a noat of what slaves sent now, I have paid them all a monthe's pay because they should leave no debts here. This morning about breake of day was brought heare the two slaves your Honour writt to me of, I have put them in irons; and shall take care of them till further order, they asked me a peece of saye for takeing of them, but I told them I would give them the custome of the country; but they said that was to little, soe I told them I would give them an angle more, that is 9 angles, soe they are gone to consider of it.
[PS] Per the slaves have sent three dozen of henns."
244,1,244,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,24/10/1681,Fort,RAC,"This day the Arcanies came and bought 7 barrells of powder, and in the opening of the powder it proves small powder, which they doe not like, they love great cannon powder. They also bought a halfe bendy of iron barrs, but they would have barrs all marked; they say they will be with me to tomorrow or next day, so desire your honour tomorrow to send great powder, iron barrs marked and what goods elce can be sparred.
[PS] I beleeve a warr will come on this country soe powder will not doe amiss here. On Satureday last I sent 12 Arder men and one woman, but as yett doe heare noe word of their arrivall."
245,1,245,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,25/10/1681,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday by a boy that came from Mr Nightingale I sent a letter for powder and iron barrs; but it must be great powder and marked iron barrs, which letter I hope came safe to hands, soe that the goods may come in Captain Starland and the canoe that comes with Captain Starland may helpe gett them on shoare, and what goods elce your Honour can spare. If ship should goe without must gett your Honour for to send some this day per canoe or tomorrow morning at farthest, for the Arcanies some of them haveing promised for to be with me this day and some tomorrow, and I think its better I should take their good money then lett the Dutch have it, soe must desire your Honours excuse for not comeing to Cabo Corsoe.
Inclosed is a noate of what I paid for the oyster shells and the canoemen. I understand the slaves were all arrived but one I suppose he was lame.
[PS] I sent a coppy of all the receipts Captain Rickards gave me but I and Francis Nixson can take our othes the two boxes of letters went of with Captain Rickards."
246,1,246,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,27/10/1681,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday morning per Captain Lawrances boate I received 20 barrells of powder, but I opened some and found 3 fine powder. I also per the 15 hand canoe received 200 iron barrs. Captain Coffe and wee had a palavera about the woman but Asham is at Fanteen, soe must stay till his returne home. There was 4 sletias and a little hogg paid on the womens freedome, but them men in irons paid but 2 sletias; and his owne sonn which went from hence in Captain Seaman paid the 2 sletias and the little hogg. Captain Coffe hear'd all."
247,1,247,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,29/10/1681,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday by Dominee of Agga I received yours, and as to dashies given att Crist-mas etc. I suppose Mr Carter gave as much as was given att Anamaboe, though indeed there is not a quarter of the Cabbisheers, soe must gett them for to take the less: imprimis to the Quantrees and Braffo 1 saye and 2 perpettuanes and 2 anchors brandy; to the Cabbisheers of Anamaboe 1 saye, 2 perpettuanes and 1 anchor of brandy; to the people for openinge the way 1 broad niccanee and 1 bottle of brandy; for the people when they put the small corne in the ground 1 case of spiritts; and to the dancing people sometimes 1 case of spiritts, 1 dozen of knives and some one [sic] paper brawle and 2 sheets, they come 4 or 5 times in a yeare. This comes by James Cunditt, who can informe your Honour how things went att Agga formerly."
248,1,248,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,11/11/1681,Fort,RAC,"This day I received yours and God willing on Munday shall waite on your Honour; and what John Rattlife hath had shall repay Mr Lewin for he had order to lett him have what he wanted as far as his pay went; I have put [this] in the month's accounts but Awinna Quidda I have not put downe, this month will be 4 months this day he came from Anishan verry ill. Just now Griffen is come from Fanteen, and the Quarranteeres and Braffo; and they would have custome for every ship that comes here. They demand 1 say and 1 anchor of brandy and say the Dutch at Cormanteen pay soe for every ship that comes to the Mina, and Griffen told them if they had not sold Cormanteen to the Dutch they might had had theire customes still; but as far as the 2 iron barrs and 2 dozen of knives itt used to be paid formerly. Doctor Griffen frowes your Honour acckie, and desires an answer tomorrow morning by his boy, which goes with the boye that brought the letter heither
[PS] James Cunditte sayeth he write to Mr Swindall. All the great powder is gone, soe if please to send some tomorrow and sayes or allejarrs, and narrow niccanees or what your honour can spaire."
249,1,249,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,21/11/1681,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours, and as to Captain Hows being at Amersa as yett [there are] noe shipps theire, but the blacks sayeth there is two shipps at Lague and Crowces; one of them supposed to be Mr Shears. If How cometh, shall use my utmost endeavour to paniare men or boates.
[PS] I pray send the canoe as soone as possible, here is some Arcanies newly come with good gold."
250,1,250,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,23/11/1681,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday by the 15 hand canoe I received yours with the goods vizt: 20 sayes, 20 chercolees, 20 herba longees, 20 silke longees, 40 broad blew baftas, 10 striped silks, 20 peeces blew long cloathes in halves, 20 barrells powder, and 20 printed perpettuanes.
[PS] The canoe goes to Anishan this evening for wood."
251,1,251,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,10/12/1681,Fort,RAC,"Just now I have received yours and have made note of whatt writt concerning Moree people. On Sunday last the Anguinas and supposed Cabesa Tera people fell on the Accrongs; these people say the Accrongs have gott the best, but as yett not knowne because the Accrongs and these [Annamaboe] people are all one country people, though severall heads doe appeare, and some slaves. Captain Woodfine presents his service to your honour and intends for Capo Corsoe in 2 or 3 dayes; but will see whether slaves will present or noe; in few dayes God willing shall send November accounts and the ballance."
252,1,252,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,15/12/1681,Fort,RAC,"This serves chiefely for a covert to the inclosed November accompt with the ballance being 8m 13a 8ta, which with the 3m lo 8a I paid Mr Henry Spurvay on the 15 ditto as per accompt, all which hope will find right and make noate accordingly; itt goes by Francis Nixon.
As to Agga factory itt must all be pulled downe, and new built or elce it will fall the next raines, thought [= though] the windows and doors and some of the thatch may serve againe. I beleive itt may cost 3 or 4 ounces. I gave James Cunduitt a forme how Wyamba house was built, which is in a better forme than ever Agga was built; and itt will be all one charge.
[PS] There is 7 marks of very good Arcanie gold."
253,1,253,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,28/12/1681,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours, and have made noat of whatt writt about corne, which shall be effected as soon as possible. I shall want about 30 or 40 deale boards, for to keepe the corne dry att the bottom. The chercolees [I] shall deliver to Captain Thomas Woodfine as inordered."
254,1,254,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,04/01/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday I received yours, and as to the unkind usage to Mr Shears, they took him for to be Mr Starland, hee fireing att the canoes had like for to doe these people some harm, soe they sweare if could gett him or his people would beate them soundly; I told them that the Braffo and Quantrees [var. Quarranteers] if they did soe would forfeit 400 bendies; but they say they must gett cracras to buy their wives cloaths and to eate. Indeed I told them they were all Braffoes; they are the worst rogues on all the coast of Guynie, and I must have patience, perforce. As to getting of corne they wont take under 1 angle and half for they say the interlopers give soe. Captain Thomas Woodfine had the 10 chercolees and 50 chests of corne as in ordered him; hee sett saile from hence on Sunday noone last past.
[PS] I shall see and gett some good fowls and send per first oppertunity."
255,1,255,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,12/01/1682,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours; and as to corne these people will not sell any under 1 angle and 6 taccoes; Docter Griffin can informe your honour. Indeed I am afraid itt will be very deare, they say itt is 6 angles a chest at Axim; and if ships come itt will raise the price here, soe cannot gett any att the prices mentioned. May please to send per first good conveyance, tapsells, sheets, perpettuanoes blew and green, narrow niccanees, sayes, sletias, and what elce your honour can spare. I have sent for Yabboyes about the canoe, so if comes before sealing shall write what he saith.
[PS] Per the canoe have sent 2 dozen of hens, all could gett att present."
256,1,256,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,13/01/1682,Fort,RAC,"Last night I spoke with Yabboys about the canoe, and hee saith there is 11 hand canoe att Laggue and they will have for it, 6 sayes; soe if Captain Woodfine likes the canoe and the price [he] may have itt. As concerning the corne they will not lett itt goe under 1 angle and halfe. When Captain Hill was here last I paid 3 angles a chest, and buy itt by the taccoe callibash. I am promised by some of the Cabisheers about a 100 chests tomorrow, soe doe not doubt but in few dayes to gett what your honour hath orderd mee. Docter Griffin is att Fanteen; when he returneth shall send Decembers accompt and the ballance. I hope your honour will not altogether forgett Anamaboe but lett mee have a few goods as tapsells, sheets, blew and greene perpettuanoes, sletias, paper brawles, sayes and what other goods can spare."
257,1,257,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,16/01/1682,Fort,RAC,"Last night Docter Griffin came from Fanteen. The reason of his long stay there was because these Capusheers not goeing to Fanteen, soe if they doe not goe before this and Wensday, all the Quantrees and Abbraers will be on these people for their abuses to the English and their tradeing with interlopers. Docter Griffin desires an answer by this canoe this night.
[PS] Docter Griffin intends to stay here till Wensday till all the pallavora is over unless your honour sends for him before."
258,1,258,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,20/01/1682,Fort,RAC,"Last night by the 15 hand canoe I received 30 broad tapsells, 25 perpettuanoes, 20 sayes, 20 course sletias, 4 chests of sheets, 50 paper brawles, and 50 Guinie stuffs, for which have given creditt. By Docter Griffin I send December accompts and the ballance being 8 ounces of good Arcanie gold, all which hope will find right and make noate accordingly. Yesterday the Quantres and Docter Griffin made an end of the pallavora and they have prendeed these people, and promised that noe such thing shall be done any more; they have put Captain Quashee with Captain Dick to looke after the white men here, soe desire your honour will be pleased to adde something more to their months sallary. Docter Griffin will acquaint your honour of all. Indeed hee hath been att a great deale of trouble and charge to doe what hath been done.
PS. Per the returne of the canoe may please to send some coales."
259,1,259,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,01/02/1682,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours, and as to corne Captain Hill hath aboard 270 chests, he wantes but 2 boates loads. As for slaves your Honour knows they sell goods cheaper and give more for slaves then the Company price is, soe cannot buy any if any ships here. Last night came into Anishan roade 2 French ships for corne, so am afraid will raise the price of corne, being very scarce. I must begg your Honours pardon for not inlarging at present, being very lame, having three wormes in one legg, being in a great paine, soe that am hardly able to write."
260,1,260,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,16/02/1682,Fort,RAC,"Last night by the 15 hand canoe I received 150 iron barrs, 200 blew long cloathes in halves, and 50 Guinea stuffs, for which I shall give creditt. The 100 broad blew baftas went to Anishan by James Cunduitt. I now send Januaryes account with balance being 3m lo 8a, which hope will find right and make noat accordingly. The gold is good Arcanie gold. I hope your Honour will spare me some blew and green perpettuanoes, sheets, course sletias, tapseels, niccanees broad and narrow, allejars, paper brawles."
261,1,261,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,02/03/1682,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours with an order for 30 or 40 chests of corne. Indeed I have not halfe so much, nor none can gett, for the interlopers lye in Agga and Cormanteen road and buy up all the corne, nay they give 2 angles and 2 angles 6 taccoes a chest in good gold; soe that I cannot gett any without a larger price. I think Captain Starland must pick out some of the best of the corne at Agga factory.
The Arcanies come to mee every day and say if your honour will not send mee some blew and green perpetuanos, sheets, course sletias, tapsells, niccannees etc. that they will goe aboard the interlopers, and buy goods there."
262,1,262,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,10/03/1682,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours with a mould for to cutt some timber, but doe not mention how many peeces. Itt will bee difficult to gett, and if should find any if itt be their fetish trees they will not suffer any body to cutt them. John Rattlife shall see if any possible to be gott. As to slaves it is impossible I should gett any as long as any ships in these parts; for they give more than I can and sell goods for less then I can; neither have I the goods they would have. Per Captain Hill God willing I intend to send my February accompts. Yesterday Captain Hill's boate was going for water to Cabo Corsoe and the Morea people hath most barbarously abused them, foure very bad and they think will dye; they tooke away their maine saile, 1 blunderbuss, 2 cuttlaces, and 2 musketts. Captain Hill will be at Cabo Corsoe in 2 or 3 dayes."
263,1,263,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,13/03/1682,Fort,RAC,"This serves cheifly for covert to the inclosed February months accompts, which goes with Captain Hill, and alsoe the ballance being 1 ounce 3 angles, all which hope will find right and make note accordingly. As to the timber according to the mould, I have sent John Ratttlife and one white man more and two Blacks, they have been 2 dayes out and could find but one, and that the Blacks would not lett them cutt, for they say it is their fetish; if any of that sort be gott it must be where few or none inhabbitts, or by the rivers or brooks. I suppose if to be gott any where on this coast, is att Wyamba."
264,1,264,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,14/03/1682,Fort,RAC,"Just now I received yours with an order to panyar all Dutch canoes etc. This morning Captain Hill sett saile for Cabo Corsoe, hee panyard a Mine canoe one Udrae, bound for Allampo, hee has 13 men and 1 women and some goods, but panyard them on the Morea mens heads for the abuse done to his men.34 I desire may heare from your honour as soon as possible, for Captain Hill said when he was here, that hee would not medle with any white men but blacks; soe desire to know whether should panyar white men or noe. May please to send mee some iron barrs and blew and greene perpettuanoes, when Captain Hill comes for Annamaboe.
[PS] May please to send a good quantity of iron barrs, but they must be all marked, otherwise they will not take them if they be never soe bigg."
265,1,265,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,18/03/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yours I have received dated the 15th instant and have made noate accordingly to take Dutchmen and blacks that belong to them, and to use them more civilly then Captain Hills men were. As to the timber to be gott here, I feare it is impossible, it grows by the rivers and brookes, and must be gott where few or non inhabbitters are, for tis their fetish; and [they] will not lett any one cut them; if to be gott any where on this coast I suppose att Wyamba. May please if not sent already [send] a good quantity of iron barrs, and some blew and green perpettuanoes, the barrs must be marked."
266,1,266,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,30/03/1682,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours, and have made noate to seize both Whites and Blacks all possible I can. I received of Mr Shears 600 iron barrs, 20 red and 20 blew and green perpettuanoes, and have given creditt for them."
267,1,267,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,07/04/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday I received yours with an order for to purchase 30 or 40 good slaves with the goods I have in the factory, but doe not mention the prices, the men here are 7 pezos 2 angles and the women 6 pezos 2 angles in good gold, Captain Hill can informe your honour, and they will not give but 9 or 10 angles att the most for red perpettuanos, soe if your honour will order mee for to give money or goods as others give, it is probable I may gett some, otherwise they carry their slaves aboard ships. I have made noate to purchase 5 or 600 chests of corne, and shall gett it as cheap as possible I can, but not to exceed 2 angles per chest, but fear itt will be very difficult to gett soe much, itt being very scarce att present."
268,1,268,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,08/04/1682,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours and have made noate of what writt about purchaseing slaves and getting corne, I shall gett as cheape as is[?]. possible. The Cabessa Terra people last weeke, would not lett the Arcanies come downe, but on Monday God willing, if any slaves come, shall gett them as cheape as any one, they want tapsells and sheets, but tapsells most.
[PS] May please to send mee some paper and inke, per first oppertunity, which I much want."
269,1,269,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,13/04/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday I received yours by the 15 hand canoe with 3 chests of sheetes, 50 broad tapsells, 14 fine sletias and 30 course sletias, for which have given creditt for the same, and have made noate that they are for the purchasing of slaves for Captain Hills quick dispatch. I assure your honour I shall use my utmost endeavour to gett what slaves possible I can. Inclosed I send Marchs monthly account by James Cunduitt with the ballance being 3 ounces, 1 angle, which hope will find right and make noate accordingly. As I wrote in my former the Cabessa Terra, Quomong, Angan and these people have stoped the way, soe that noe slaves nor any trade att present."
270,1,270,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,20/04/1682,Fort,RAC,"Just now I received yours whereby I understand [you] admire [you] have not heard from mee. In my two former I advised your honour the ways are stopped soe that there are few slaves and little trade. I have in irons but 6 men slaves and I beleeve shall gett but 5 of them, but I am promised if any slaves come I shall have them. As to corne it is very scarce, I have but 26 in 28 chests. I will assure your honour I will doe what possible I can for to gett slaves and corne, being boathe scarce att present."
271,1,271,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,04/05/1682,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours whereby [you] doe wonder have not heard from mee. Indeede I have not had an oppertunity till now, only by Mr Pley whoe departed the same night Captain Hill sett saile; and I desired him to informe your honour what was past, soe hope will please to pardon my neglect in not writting. I put aboard Captain Hill 16 slaves, 8 men and 8 woemen, and 44 chests of corne, all I could gett. And since I cannot hardly gett corne to eate, these people as yett have not done sowing their small corne, soe that att present I cannot gett any great corne, and now they aske more for their corne, Captain Attwell can informe your honour. As to the Company's concerns att Anamaboe I thank God all is very well and God willing I doe not doubt but for to give a good accompt thereof. As concerning the Arcanies tradeing with interlopers, att this place they doe not, but what they doe att other places I cannot tell, yett they carry slaves aboard the Company ships and they sell them goods as cheape as any interloper, indeed I think they [i.e. Company ships] are the greatest, and spoyle the factory's. I have made inquiry after Abounshee, hee liveth att Anishan but if I can get him here I shall secure him till further order."
272,1,272,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,23/05/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 20th instant I have received, and had sent James Cunduitt up sooner, but the weather was very bad, and now hee goes in Captain Shepheards boate with him; and have sent John Rattliffe for to looke after Agga factory. Per James Cunduitt I alsoe sent Aprills months accompt with the ballance, being 2 marks, 1 ounce and 10 tacco's, which hope will find right and make noate accordingly; I had sent them sooner but could not gett any safe Conveyance before now. As concerning corne, this day I putt aboard Captain Shepheard 50 chests of corne, att 2 angles per chest, and since his ship is come hither it is risen to 2 angles and 6 tacco's per chest. Indeed corne is very scarce att present and if any more ships come hither I am afraid itt will raise corne to 3a or 4a per chest. Captain Shepheard God willing this evening intends for Cabo Corsoe, I suppose hee may have gott of the Blacks 15 in 20 chests of corne. I am promised some more corne. I assure your honour I doe what lieth in my power, and would send oftener but am loath to put the Company to 2 angles charge for every letter.
[PS] May please to send per first good conveyance some broad tapsells, lead barrs, sheets, Guyney clouts, large sletias and blew and green perpetuano's. I alsoe want some match, carteridge paper and minion shott."
273,1,273,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,27/05/1682,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours whereby [you] desire to know how Captain Shepheard proceeds in getting of corne, I suppose hee may have about 100 chests aboard. Yesterday writt your honour by James Cunduitt, which hope is arrived safe. I have large promises of corne, though little performance, itt being very scarce.
[PS] Just now I received 30 minion shott, one quire of carteridge paper and one scane of match. Indeed if the ships had stayed att Capo Corsoe I belieeve that corne might have been att a cheaper rate then it is now."
274,1,274,receipts,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,28-29/05/1682,Fort,RAC,"Richard Shepheard Anamaboe, 28 May 1682
I doe acknowledge to have received from Mr Thelwall one 11 hand canoe, for which he paid 1 mark and 4 ounces of gold, itt being on account of the Royall Affrican Company at Arda.
Richard Shepheard Anamaboe, 29 May 1682
I doe acknowledge to have received 100 chests of corne from Mr Richard Thelwall on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England for the use of their slaves on board the St George."
275,1,275,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,03/06/1682,Fort,RAC,"I have received two of yours, one by Mr Shears and one by Captain Shepheard, and hee hath seen thee corne att Agga but doth not like itt, and [I] have alsoe bought a 11 hand canoe, a verry good strong canoe, but must give 6 bendy's. I hope in a few dayes to gett the 10 slaves for Mr Shears, but cannot gett them under 7 peze 2 angles
and 6 peze 2 angles. May please to send per Mr Shears or per first conveyniency some blew and green perpetuanoes, broad tapsells, lead barrs, sheets, Guyney clouts, large sletias."
276,1,276,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,20/06/1682,Fort,RAC,"This morning came one of the Quantrees from Cabo Corsoe but never a letter, and they want something towards their danceing which begins to morrow or next day, and they wont lett mee alone till had writt your honour about itt. Indeed I want a copie of the agreement, or else a line or two what I must give them, they send a man on purpose."
277,1,277,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,23/06/1682,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours whereby would know how corne sells here. Itt is att 2 angles 6 tacco's per chest in good gold, besides what dashey's in brandy and cloaths. Last night most of the Cabisheers went for Fanteen, this day being their Christmas day, as they call it, soe till they returne will be little corne gott, and will stay there 9 in 10 dayes, and new corne will not be good here this 6 weeks; the corne att Cabo Corsoe will be ripe a month or three weekes before this; but if your honour will order mee to buy old corne and give gold and dashies, as others did and doe, I suppose may gett some as well as others, but what quantity I cannot tell, till our people returne.

When [he] returnes shall be sent also."
279,1,279,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,27/06/1682,Fort,RAC,"This comes by Francis Nixon by whome I have sent 6 marks of good Arcanie gold on acccompt of June monthly accompt, and desire your honour will be pleased for to send mee some more iron barrs; but they must be all marked, for indeed I have a great many barrs here, but they are very small and most of them not marked; and [send] some perpettuano's, for I have 12 perpetuanoes that came downe last, a little broken, and they wont take them without some abatements. I want some powder but itt must be all greate else they wont buy itt, all the powder I have is small and they wont buy itt. May please to send me some brandy, for itt draws neare the bottom, and some paper for itt almost gon.
[PS] I have bought Captain Starlands canoe man as in ordered but could not gett him under a bendy, soe when your honour pleases to order mee I shall send him for Cabo Corsoe Castle."
280,1,280,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,29/06/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday by the 15 hand canoe I received 150 iron barrs, 2 bailes of perpetuano's, and 20 barrells of powder, and very speedily would send one hogshead of brandy. I have per Captain Peeter sent the canoeman that was panyard att Wyamba but was forced to give a bendy and much adoe to gett him."
281,1,281,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,04/07/1682,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours, whereby [you] desire for to gett 450 or 500 chests of corne for Captain North. This morning I spake with our Cabisheers, and hee that hath most hath but 5 chests; but they say if I would give as others did, they would send to Annian and gett some; I told them all the ships were gon, and the other ships would take new corne, but att last when they went away, they said if your honour will give 2 angles they will send up into the country for to gett some, soe if please to send present advice, what [you] will give, I shall use my utmost endeavour, but [you] must send word before the ship comes downe, otherwise they will raise the price. Yesterday and this day I sold 43 perpetuano's and most of the iron that came downe in the canoes, I have 6 in 7 marks of good gold which shall send per first good oppertunity. May please to send some more perpetuano's per first good oppertunity, for great many of these are broken and wormeaten. The Arcanies like these last iron barrs, and would have mee write for some more of the same, and some good perpetuano's."
282,1,282,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,06/07/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday I received yours, and as in ordered have made bargaine with the Cabisheers for 500 chests of corne att 2 angles per chest, and their canoes to carry itt aboard, but itt is their custome they will have something, they will not make a dry bargaine; they tell me I shall have itt all in a few dayes. This morning they have brought in 20 in 30 chests, and have sent their people into the country for to gett the rest. I have made noate of the brandy, iron and perpetuanoes that comes by Captain North, for which I returne your honour many thanks. In 2 or 3 dayes shall send June account with the ballance."
283,1,283,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,07/07/1682,Fort,RAC,"This serves cheifly for covert to the inclosed June accompt which goes with Francis Nixon, and the ballance being 7 marks, 4 ounces, 3 angles, and 6 tacco's, which with the 6 marks formerly sent, makes the full ballance in all 13 marks, 4 ounces, 3 angles, and 6 taccoes, which hope will find right and make noate accordingly."
284,1,284,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,16/07/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday I received yours. And as to the corne I shall putt aboard 76 chests of old corne, all that I have att present, though they promise every day more, butt itt comes but slowly; and new corne they will have 1 angle and 6 taccoes per chest, and I am afraid that there is not old corne enough in the country for this ship. Captain North is very weake.
[PS] I spake to Yaboyes about the cow and hee wont take under a bendy and 12 angles, which I think is very deare."
285,1,285,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,19/07/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday I received yours, and as to old corne, as I wrote in my former it comes in but slowly, I have but 15 chests, since the other putt aboard, I have spoke to the Cabisheers and this day suppose may have about 100 chests of new corne, but they wont take under 1 angle 6 taccoes per chest and itt will be 6 in 7 dayes adrying before itt will be fitting to put aboard ship, I put itt on the top of the house and on the flankers adrying every day. I assure your honour I doe what possible I can for Captain Norths speedie dispatch, hee is very weake but the Docter saith hee is on the mending hand."
286,1,286,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,01/01/1000,Fort,RAC,"This serves chiefely for covert to the inclosed accompt with the ballance being 2 markes, 3 ounces, 3 angles and 4 tacco's, which goes by Mr John Smith, which hope will find right and make noate accordingly. I received of Captain Sheppard 8 sayes whereof 3 broken, 5 perpetuano's and 3 broken and 2 of them redds, 9 fine sletias and 30 Guyney clouts, for which shall give creditt for in June account with the other goods received from Cabo Corsoe Castle."
287,1,287,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,06/08/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday I received yours whereby understand on Monday the 15 hand canoe will come hither with goods, for which I give your honour many thanks. As concerning buying 1,000 chests of corne, itt may be gott in a shorte time, but the people here wont take under 1 angle and a halfe. I told them your honour paid but 1 angle, but they told mee that all Fetue had not corne enough for 2 shipps and then must be forced for to give a larger price, these people are cunning rogues; soe if please to in order to gett itt at 1 angle and halfe itt may be done.
[PS] Yesterday the Abbraers and Quomong people fell on Cormanteen people and killed 6, and panyard 33, burnt halfe the great towne, some came hither but they are all run away."
288,1,288,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,09/08/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday I received yours by the 15 hand canoe, as alsoe 2 bailes of sayes, 10 piecess white longcloath and 99 pieces of blew longcloaths, there wanting 2 halfe pieces, they were told 3 times. And haveing this good oppertunity of the 15 hand canoe I have by Benjamin Cantrill sent 4 marks of good Arcanie gold on July months accompt, and as to the corne shall gett as soone as possible; as concerning slaves, though the Abbraers panyard the Cormanteen people, yett they dare not sell them for they are all of one country, and itt is thought that that man [who] was the occasion of Cormanteen being burnt, will be ruined and all his generation. Indeed
I beleeve slaves will be very deare, and these people will not sell now under 7 pease
2 angles for a man and 6 pease 2 angles for a woeman; and if please to in order to
give as others give I may gett some.
[PS] John Wise desires that Tom True may come downe to him, Awina Quidda being lame and ill."
289,1,289,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,19/08/1682,Fort,RAC,"This goes by the canoe that brought mee hither and serves chiefely to give your honour advice that I haveing made an end Thirsday night in Mr Thelwalls business my stay hath been here ever since for Mr Richards, whoe the same day I came hither [I] heard was abroad, soe immediatly wrote William Beard to dispatch some one to him for his quick returne, he wrote mee back hee had done itt and that in all probability hee might be att home on Fryday. This morning a small noate came to Mr Thelwall from Mr Richards that hee was getting of canoes and should not be att home in 3 dayes time, I shall waite for his comeing if your honour order mee not to the contrary, and intend back in a hammack, for yesterday morning I was voiloently attacqu'd with an ague and feavour and vomitting, which I judge pro-ceeded from cold that I had taken in the canoe. Captain Ware is come ashoare but brings noe order what quantity of corne hee is to take in, which Mr Thelwall desires your honour would be pleased to send. Hee hath 700 chests or thereabouts and more dayly is brought in."
290,1,290,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,23/08/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday Captain Ware had aboard ship 310 chests and this day hope will gett most of his corne. I have made noate for the 50 chests as inordered. Captain Ware God willing on Fryday intends for Capo Corsoe. Mr Wallis is very ill and the Docter saith past all recovery, hee had an ague and a feavour the first day hee came ashoare here, hee saith hee gott cold in the canoe."
291,1,291,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,23/08/1682,Fort,RAC,"This morning I wrote your honour that Mr Wallis was very ill, in 3 or 4 hours after hee departed this life and desired mee to send his body to Cabo Corsoe for to be buryed, soe for to fulfill the desire of the dead I have sent itt, hee desireth that Mr Stapleton should looke after his concerns as by the papers in his small trunk which comes by his boy, as alsoe desires Mr Stapleton for to see him decently buryed."
292,1,292,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,30/08/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 28th ditto I received and immediatly as inordered sent the inclosed to Mr Richards but hee would not write, saying to the man that hee had neither pen, inke nor paper, itt was all att Anishan; and as to gett the goods I beleeve itt is the best way for to lett them alone a little while till the Curranteer comes, for his son Quacoone told mee nothing should be medled withall, and Benjamin Cantrill hath the keys. Yesterday Captain Nurse sett saile, I put aboard him 200 chests of corne and hee saith must have more. This day Captain Ware will saile, hee hath gott a canoe. Captain Nurse his letter arrived him att Lague, hee presents his service to your honour. Inclosed is July accompt, which hope will find right and make noate accordingly. May please to send per first good oppertunity some Guyney clouts and some paper brails."

Captain Ambrose tomorrow about noone I suppose will have all his corne aboard. I shall take care for to send a white man to Amersa about the oystershells but am afraid there will not be anything abated. As soone as these ships are gon I shall gett the timber downe to the waterside, and shall send the slave per first oppertunity. The other slave that Bonishee hath, hee saith hee paid a bendy; but as I understand him, is desirous for to change for a slave Mr Shears hath. I shall make further enquiry after and shall acquaint your honour."
294,1,294,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,14/09/1682,Fort,RAC,"Just now I received yours and if your honour think fitting I beleeve itt would be better taken that William Pley and William Beard goe by your order, but if any thing that they should want any of my assistance, I can be there in one houre; besides these people are great rogues and will say that I am the occasion of that factory's being remov'd, and may breed a differance between these people and mee, soe if possible I desire your honour I may be excused; else these people will lay all the fault on mee and I shall never live in quiett."

296,1,296,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,18/09/1682,Fort,RAC,"Just now I received yours as Captain Ambrose was goeing off, and I tould him what your honour wrote; and hee protesteth that hee desired Mr Richards for to come into the fort and resigne up himselfe unto mee, but Mr Richards answered what, will you betray mee, that was all hee said, in the time they were discourseing I went and gave our people powder and bulletts for feare of any trouble, soe Mr Richards went to one of our Cabosheers houses in towne, but I tould him they must not protect him, soe I beleeve his boyes telling him hee thought for to make an escape and run away, soe our Bendyfoo's quickly fought him back againe, they say hee fired att them 6 times, that was the reason they tooke away all his cloaths, but his gun would not goe off. They will have 8 gallons of brandy and some powder for takeing of him. I think your honour would doe well for to send Docter Meade downe this night, itt being his sick night, and the other Docter is gon and hee being verry weake, soe for feare of a relapse and noe body for to helpe him itt is better that hee comes as soon as possible."
297,1,297,Ambrose Meade,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,18/09/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday a little after sunsett I arrived at Anamaboe where I found Mr Starland in his paroxisme and very delireous, whereupon I immediatly cupped him and tooke a considerable quantity of blood from his temples, whereupon hee quickly fell asleep and rested all the whole night, this is the third fitt which hee hath had. This morning have given him a doce of physick because hee hath not been purged since hee hath been taken ill, for the chirurgeon of Captain Ambrose only lett him blood and gave him one or two glysters His fitt comes every other day towards evening. I doe intend to draw blisters but if I can possibly be spared from Cabo Corsoe itt will be more proper to apply one 8 or 10 hours before his fitt comes, which I hope in god may prevent itt. If your worship cannot spare mee soe long I will apply them this night and come up according to your first order, although they will not be soe proper."
298,1,298,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,22/09/1682,Fort,RAC,"This comes with the corpes of Mr Starland, whoe departed this life, this day a quarter of an houre past 11; hee had in gold about him 1 ounce, 3 angles, three gold rings, three silver buttons for his shirt, one gowne and one coate, which God willing shall send tomorrow by John, Docter Meads mate, whoe can informe your honour how hee was after Docter Mead left him.
[PS] Here is a pockett book which shall goe by John, but his key's and everything are left with his mate aboard ship, as the Docters mate can informe your Honour."
299,1,299,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,28/09/1682,Fort,RAC,"This serves cheifly for covert to the inclosed August accompt with the ballance being 2 ounces, 10 angles, and 8 taccoes, which with the 2 markes of gold I gave Mr Spurvay when I was last att Cabo Corsoe Castle makes even that accompt, which hope will find right and make noate accordingly. This comes by Francis Nixon, by whome I have sent 10 markes of good Arcanie gold on September months accompt, soe there is in all 10 markes, 2 ounces, 10 angles and 8 taccoes. May please to send per first good oppertunity some good perpettuano's, white long cloaths, sayes, pewter basons great and small, Guyney clouts and some great pow-der. I expect the Arcanies downe here on Monday next, I have sold them some of the perpettuanoes that were broken and wormeaten att 10a, the good att 11a one with another, but if your honour would order the red perpettuano's for to be sold att 9a and 10a they would goe off, better then to lett the wormes and cockroaches eate them.

301,1,301,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,04/10/1682,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours, and concerning the Captain of the Arcanies I have spoke to him and told him if [he] gave your honour encouragement you would consider him something, hee saith hee would looke out for to gett some, Indeed hee hath brought mee already above 3 marks. I beleive the Dutch have but little goods, that is one reason, but the Captain saith Anishan Arcanies have above 2 pease a month, soe hee saith hee may deserve itt as well as others. Here is one slave in towne of the Ardas but they would change for one Fanteen man that is aboard Captain Nurse. Last night I paid Oystershell Quashee for 109 butts. The canoemen made 38 [var. 39] turns aboard ship. Quashee is still att mee about the slave."
302,1,302,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,12/10/1682,Fort,RAC,"This serves cheifly for covert to the inclosed September accompt with the ballance being 1 marke, 1 ounce, 1 angle and 10 tacco's, which with the 10 markes I sent up the 18th September past makes even that accompt, which hope will find right and make noate accordingly. This comes by Francis Nixon by whome I have sent 10 markes of good Arcanie gold on October months accompt, soe there is in all 11 marks, 1 ounce, 1 angle and 10 taccoes.
May please to send per first good oppertunity some perpetuano's and good iron barrs, but they must be all marked else they wont take them. As concerning the red slave I bought him of an Arcanie but as yett hee is not come out of the country, but Boneshee saith hee bought his slave of a Fanteen man, but will not tell his name without a greate dashey and if [he] should give itt I question whether [it?] should be ever the better, nay hee saith there hath been 5 slaves sold aboard interlopers. Indeed these people are the greatest rogues in all these country's. As to the custome of the country, if they had been taken in Fettue country then but a pease, but if in another Kings country they sell them; soe they say is the custome. I cannot heare of any slaves at Quobinas croome."
303,1,303,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,16/10/1682,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours.

I know of noe other, neither was any other proffered mee, if should I would have given the price of a man slave. As to corne, if Captain Churchey comes in 3 or 4 day's itt is ready. And as to a 9 hand canoe, here is one here, but they aske 5 bendy's."

311,1,311,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,01/12/1682,Fort,RAC,"I owe answer to two for want of conveniency of sending.

Att present sayes is a drug, for the Dutch have lowered their say's to 17 angles and the people say theirs is of a better couller (Patience). Two or three day's agoe the Dutch Copeman of Cormanteen was shott with a peece of iron in his left eye and one through his hatt by one of Annamaboe. All these Cabasheers are att Fanteen as yett, soe I know not anything of their pallavora. Tomorrow I suppose Captain Churchey will have all his corne aboard."

I have made note of what your Honour writt concerning the lowering the prizes of goods, and doe not doubt but shall take money as well as they. On Monday last Captain Churchey sett saile for Arda. In few dayes God willing shall send November accompt."
313,1,313,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,17/12/1682,Fort,RAC,"This morning I received yours, and as to the Companys affaires here I thank God all is verry well, though but little trade att present, for I find the Dutch are a kind of cunning sort of underminding people; they have sent a bendy to our Arcanies here to gett them send mony's to them; soe I have sent some to theirs; and have had them here twice or thrice, and tould them would sell them goods as cheape as they; and they have promised to come to mee; I expect some of them this weeke, they come some times but once in a fortnight and they say the Dutch sells sheets for 1 angle apeece. Inclosed is November accompt, which hope will find right and make note accordingly; there wants 5 ounces 15 angles for the ballance, which shall send with more money as itt comes in per first good oppertunity. In the 9m sent per Evan Price was 2m 4o la on November accompt, and by Francis Nixon 10 arkes, soe 5 ounces, 15 angles makes the ballance of that accompt."
314,1,314,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,02/01/1683,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday I received yours, and have spoken to the Cabasheers about the two slaves that ran away, they tell mee they will doe what they can if [they] should come in these parts.

I sent one aboard with Mr Lewin to wittness what was don. I have received all the goods by the Busse, James Bayley [Commander] and have given creditt for accordingly, but as long as these ships undersell mee I cannot take any money."

318,1,318,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,18/01/1683,Fort,RAC,"This comes by Captain Cope whoe can informe your Honour. As concerning of trade, as long as these interlopers stay here I cannot take any money for they undersell mee, they sell perpetuano's at 6 and 7 angles, sayes att 12 and 13 angles Fanteen money, and other goods accordingly. Indeed since I came here from Cabo Corsoe att Christmas I can hardly take money to pay the Whitemen and blacks this month. There hath been 10 interlopers since Christmas. This day two sett saile, and I beleeve the Dutch furnish themselves with goods out of them, but I hope they are all gon and then I dont doubt but shall have a good trade againe. Tomorrow God willing Captain Cope will have all his corne aboard, the 5 hand canoe kickadevoo'd with 8 chests corne and was all lost. I have been troubled with vommitting this 4 or 5 dayes or else had sent December account, but shall send itt by first oppertunity."
319,1,319,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,23/01/1683,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday I received yours with a pacquett for Captain Cope but hee was gone above 4 houres before, soe I have returned itt againe, hee stayed till betwixt 12 and 1 for the letters. As to James Mills, for a certaine hee is drownded att Allampo and two of the canoemen, the goods all lost, and the canoe broken all to peeces. Here is come one or two of rogue Bonishee's men here; itt seemes James Mills was to have been factor for rogue Bonishee att Allampo. The canoe and one Whiteman is gon to Amersa. I have the two canoemen from Captain Cope. Yesterday the Dutch Copeman of Cormanteen sent to mee two Whitemen and desired mee for to keepe the men here and in a small time they will send mee two for them. The canoe was an old canoe and broken all to peeces, itt is left aboard ship. Yesterday appeared a ship off Amersa, his boate was aboard Captain Cope, itt seems one Captain Davis, [he] is bound for the Bite. As to trade att present itt is glutted for here hath been soe many interlopers that hath spoyl'd itt, butt hope in a small time itt will come againe (Patience). Inclosed is December account, which hope will find right and make noate accordingly. Indeed I had sent it sooner but I have not been well this 10 day's; yesterday was my ill day, but I hope when gott something from Docter Meade itt will remove the distemper. This morning all our Capasheers came here about Ampeteens pallavora, they brought 3 sheepe but I told them that would not doe, I bid them goe to Capo Corsoe, soe then they desired mee for to give them Ampeteens chests, but I told them they should not have them till the pallavora was over, soe they went away angry."
320,1,320,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,08/02/1683,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday I received yours, and this morning I sent up Francis Nixon to Cabo Corsoe in a canoe with the ballance of Decembers accompt and January, alsoe 5 marks on February accompt, which hope will arrive before this. I sent 10 marks, 5 angles and 7 tacco's in all. As to trade I have but little, only last Monday and Tuseday I tooke 4 in 5 marks, which was most for sheets. As money comes in I shall send itt to your honour, but the Arcanies doe not come every weeke. In a little time I shall want sheets and marked iron barrs, they will be the first I shall want, which may please to send per first good oppertunity. The other day I opened a bale of perpetuano's and they were all rotten with salt water, all but 5 or 6, Francis Nixon can informe your honour. As to any thing elce here all is well."
321,1,321,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,09/02/1683,Fort,RAC,"This serves chiefely for covert to the inclosed Januarys accompt, which hope will find right and make note accordingly. By Francis Nixon I have sent to your honour 10 marks, 5 angles and 7 taccoes of good Arcanie gold, whereof 1 mark 2 ounces 1 angle and 9 tacco's being the ballance of Decembers accompt and 3 marks, 6 ounces, 3 angles and 10 tacco's on January's accompt, and 5 marks on Februarys accompt, makes in all 10m 0a 5a 7ta. I must begg your honours pardon that I have not writt oftener nor sent the accompt, for I am not as yett throughly well. May please per first good oppertunity for to send a good quantity of sheets and marked iron barrs, for them I shall first want, and 3 pound basons."
322,1,322,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,12/02/1683,Fort,RAC,"Just now I received yours whereby I understand you desire to know what quantity of iron barrs I wanted. I spoke to the Arcanies; they say 1,000 will be gone in a little time if marked barrs, and noe flawes in them, and 20 chests of sheets, or what your honour can spare. I have but halfe a chest of sheets left, and some 3 pound basons, the other will not goe off. As to the news of the country the Captain of the Portugueze of Anishan and the Quarranteer can not agree, and hee would remove from Anishan and take his people and his things; some say hath gott most part of his best things aboard the ship. The ship for this 2 dayes hath panyard Annamaboe and Anishan canoes, and att Accra they have panyard a 11 hand canoe of Annamaboe peoples full of cowes; and they say when they deliver up their whitemen and things they will deliver up their men and things. Indeed these Fanteeners are all great rogues and there is noe doeing with them unless [you] sett other nations and them by land. They want warrs."
323,1,323,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,28/02/1683,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours, whereby I understand there was a Company's ship arrived and that [you] desired to know what goods I most wanted. Att present I only want sheets and 3 pound basons. As to corne per former order to keepe a store, I have above 900 chests, and when this ship hath taken her corne I shall fill the corne room againe, but shall not lett them know any thing, if should they would quickly raise the price, for these people are all greate rogues."
324,1,324,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,10/03/1682,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours, whereby I understood what goods I wanted I should be supplyed by Captain Woolliford, for which give your Honour many thankes, and as inordred this morning I send Millington for Capo Corsoe Castle. The last ship that came downe here was a Frenchman as the Blacks sayes, he sett saile last night. As to Aga palavera they would not lett John Ratclifte have any thing to eat or drinke there for this 2 dayes, and last night they sent Arda Jack and his wife hither, I left them to helpe John Ratclifte there, and this morning John Ratclifte hath been heere to fetch his chest and other things there, soe they lett him take his things but would not lett him take the key of the doore, soe I bid him take an account of the benches and windows that was there etc., and when he asked for the key they thrust him away and bid him begon. I sent them word last night if any bench etc. was missing, one day will come when they must pay for it. Indeed these people may very well say their Braffoe is a foole, for they all doe what they please. They want warrs here to make them poore, and untill then I feare they will never be at quiett."
325,1,325,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,12/03/1682,Fort,RAC,"On the 10th instant I received yours, and as to hazard a fight with these Fanteen rogues I beleive I could, for I have wood water and corne enough, but I want granadoe shells and firelocks, bandileirs and swords for the people. Nay I veryly beleive it will not be long ere they play the rogue againe, when they must be sure to have some mischeife come to them. But if your Worship could gett some other nation to come by land and burne their houses and sell their wives and children for slaves, take their corne and all they have, [that] will make them humble. Inclosed is February account, which hope will find right and make noat accordingly. By Francis Nixon I now send 7 marks, 1 ounce, 15 angles of good Arcanie gold, which with 5 marks sent the 9th ditto makes the ballance of February account.
[PS] In few dayes it is hoped the palavera with Cabesa Terra will be over and then trade will be open."
326,1,326,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,20/03/1682,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours, and to my opinion I beleive it is the best way for to send to the Braffo to acquaint him of all these people [s] roguery, and if they dont give satisfaction to sett some other neighbouring nation on them, for to bring them to, as the Dutch doe, and then they will be glad to come to the English for help, and [ourselves] not to be seen, but as friends to their friends. The goods in Captain Woolliford are coming on shoare, and the corne agoeing off, but at present little trade by reason of the interlopers continually coming."
327,1,327,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,22/03/1682,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours whereby I understand Captain Rickard and Captain Low is on the coast, and that Captain Waugh is at Capo Corso. I have acquainted Captain Woollifords two mates, to tell him that your Honour desires him to stay until Saterday; and then he should not faile of his dispatches. This day Captain Woollifords corne will be all aboard. As to the Fanteens they are as great rogues as ever they was. Yesterday they beat John Ratclift as he was looking for to see the corne goe downe to the waterside. I sent to the Captain of the towne and Mareene and they have put the man in irons and they say they will punish him. Indeed I beleive veryly they will never be quiett unless they have war to bring them low, which must be done by some neighbouring nation and they not know who it is that setts them on; and then they would be glad to come to the English for help.
[PS] I am forct at present not to take much notice, for if should would not let the corne nor anything come in or goe out here."
328,1,328,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,31/03/1682,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours, and as inordred God willing on Sunday I shall goe for Cabo Corso Castle and shall bring what gold I have. Just now I received another of yours with an order to gett about 1500 chests of corne, which shall be effected as soone as possible; but must desire your Honour to keep the shipps there as long as may be, and not for to come all togeather, for if they doe they will raise the price, and now corne growes scarce, and these people are cunning rogues. I shall see if there be a 9 hand canoe to be sold and the lowest price."

These Fanteen people for these 4 or 5 dayes have been att warr with the Dutch att Cormanteen and have panyard 20 in 30 of their slaves as they went for water and wood and have sent them to Fanteen, and yesterday the Dutch shutt up their Castle gates, for these people will not lett them have any thing to eate or drink. I see I am not alone, but these people play the rogue with all people. The Dutch have 25 Whitemen and more Blacks, 4 flankers and 16 guns, but for ought I see dont care for to meddle with these people. These people say they will have custome for all Dutch ships that goes to the Mina."
331,1,331,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,20/04/1683,Fort,RAC,"Just now I received yours, and as to the settling of Agga factory, Mr Burrowes may goe for Agga when hee pleaseth and shall have what goods I have here as inordered, but if any thing should prove otherwise then, well, I must not be responsable, but only for my selfe, if all be in one accompt, though Mr Burrow's is a verry good husband, yett Mr Hassell gave security in England. Captain Lowe hath 570 chests corne measur'd, which is all I have att present."
332,1,332,Thomas Burrows,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,20/04/1683,Fort,RAC,"Mr Thelwall shewed mee your order and the rest of the Gentlemen of the Councill for my goeing to Agga, for which I give your Honour thanks. The house att present is out of repaire for want of thatch, but suppose Mr Thelwall will in a short time take care to repaire itt. I hope your honour and the Councill have taken into consideration that I cannot live there for the same sallary that I have here, and although I eate now at Mr Thelwalls table I doe not expect to put up a penney of my sallary, but be thankfull to him to except of the same for my dyett. I find that the custome of the place is to give the Cabosheers of the place both morning and evening drams and that they dayly expect itt, therefore hope there will be an allowance for itt. I thought fitt to give your honour an accompt of itt, for although I have given but my owne security I will not make soe bold with the Companys goods as to give a bitt of them in dashey's to the Blacks, which I know will be expected of mee, till such time as I know whether my sallary will bear itt. Your Honour is sencible that my stock is but small, therefore am unwilling to run beyond itt; therefore humbly begg your pardon for what I have writt."

334,1,334,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,01/05/1683,Fort,RAC,"Just now I received [yours], whereby I understand Captain Richard Lumley was arrived in one of the Companys ships, and verry shortly were more expected. As inordered I have made note for to gett what corne possible I can, but att present itt growes scarce and if these Fanteen rogues should know there is a want of corne they would quickly raise the price, but I never lett them know till the ships come into this roade for itt. As to slaves here they are scarce and good slaves, men are 7 pease 2 angles and woemen 6 pease 2 angles, nay some people give a bendy for a man. Inclosed is March accompts and the receipts for corne and slaves, which hope will find right and make noate accordingly; And God willing in few dayes shall send Aprill months accompt with their ballance. When I was att Cabo Corsoe last I paid Mr Walter Stapleton 6 marks of gold on March months accompt, soe there remaines on that accompt 2 marks, 1 ounce, 13 angles and 10 tacco's, and as soone as possible shall send that and the ballance of Aprill accompt altogether. This morning the Quantrees Tetee was here and I have sent all Whiteman and some Blacks with him for to take possession of Agga factory, for the house wants a greate deale of repairing and thatching, but would desire your honour when the house is fitting to put goods in you would send what goods your honour thinks fitting from Cabo Corsoe, for if should come from mee they would never be att peace with mee nor I should never bee att quiett here. I suppose Mr Burrowes expects an answer from your honour of the letter hee sent. Last night came in Agga roade Captain How an interloper, hee comes from Allampo."
335,1,335,Thomas Burrows,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,03/05/1683,Fort,RAC,"I have yours of the 1st instant, for which I give your honour thanks and shall observe the contents of and repaire myselfe to Agga as soone as the house is fitted, which I suppose will be don by Satureday next, where I shall endeavour to advance the Royall Companys interest as much as in mee ly's."
336,1,336,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,04/05/1683,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday I received yours, and as to Agga Factory itt will be ready on Monday next for to goe thither. Soe if your honour sends the sloope with goods they shall be landed as inordered and suppose Mr Burrowes will goe but hee will want brandy and I have but 30 gallons left, which will not last both places but a little, while Mr Burrowes desires mee for to have Michaell Millington for to goe with him to Agga, I tould him hee should, soe thought fitt to acquaint your honour. The corne roome att Agga must be all new built, which shall be don as soone as possible, for the thatch is almost all off, and the poles are all rotton. I shall send some Ardars and a woeman to Agga to helpe Mr Burrowes in any thing hee shall want. I have about 100 chests corne and have sent up in the country for the people to bring their corne downe, but itt doth not come as formerly by reason itt grows scarce. I shall gett what possible I can."
337,1,337,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,06/05/1683,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours. As to corne I have 100 and odd chests but I cannot tell whether I shall gett enough corne betwixt this and Wensday for Captain Lumley, but desire your honour for to keepe him till this day sennitt for now they are forct to send up in the country a great way for their corne, I shall seeke for to gett itt as soone as possible may be. As to goods proper for Agga, iron barrs, lead barrs, sayes, perpetuano's, sheets, paper brawles, and Guyney clouts etc., what your Honour thinks fitting, but itt would be convenient the sloope be here 2 or 3 dayes before the ship comes here, for itt will be a great trouble for to land the goods here and send them afterwards a mile by land to Agga. Mr Burrowes hath been troubled with a paine in his head and bones, I suppose gott cold. Francis Nixon hath been ill this 10 day's. Old Harrey, old Charles, John Ratlife, they have been all ill, but thanks be to God they are all on the mending hand. As to a canoe, here is none to be gott for love nor money. I and Mr Burrows wants wrighting paper and inke and some brandy for Mr Burrow's, for I have but little left."
338,1,338,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,07/05/1683,Fort,RAC,"This is by the request of Mr Burrow's that your honour would be pleased to lett Docter Meade come to see him this night, for the last night hee had a voyolent feavour and noe ague, which is soe much the worse, hee expects his feavour this night, hee is alsoe verry drye and nothing will stay with him but water, and hath a great paine in all his bones, hee hath sweated for this 3 dayes and saith is verry weake. Indeed I never knew a lustie young man soe faint hearted as hee is, soe desires if possible that Docter Meade may come, if not that hee would send him something that may abate his feavour."
339,1,339,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,10/05/1683,Fort,RAC,"Just now I received [yours], and as to Mr Burrows, since the Docters mate hath blooded him and gave him two glisters his feavour hath something abated but hee is verry weake, and as the people that looke after him say they never see a man soe faint hearted as hee is, and in grace of God hee may doe well againe if his faint heartedness dont cast him downe againe. Mr Burrow's likewise desires your honour would be pleased that the Docters mate may stay with him till the ship comes downe here. Our Cabasheers have been in the country att Abbra this 5 dayes amakeing a new Captain there, soe this week I have gott but little corne. I beleeve I may have upwards of 200 chests, but tomorrow expect our Cabasheers here and for once must take in corne of a Sunday. I have gave some of them goods beforehand to buy corne and doe not doubt before Captain Lumley hath taken what corne I have that I shall gett enough for him, though the interloprs att present hinder mee, for they give 2 angles per chest. Tomorrow morning God willing if wind and weather doth permitt I shall send Francis Nixon with Aprill account and allsoe the ballance, and alsoe what hens possible I can gett."
340,1,340,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,11/05/1683,Fort,RAC,"This serves cheifly for covert to the inclosed Aprill months accompt, which hope will find right and make noate accordingly. By Francis Nixon I now send 2 marks, 1 ounce, 13 angles and 10 tacco's being the ballance of March accompt. And alsoe 4 marks, 2 ounces 11 angles and 10 tacco's being the ballance of Aprills months accompt; in all 6 marks, 4 ounces, 9 angles and 8 tacco's. Att present two interlopers in these roads, one in Anishan roade and the other in Agga roade, soe but little trade. The first goods I shall want will be sheets, which may please to send per first good oppertunity."
341,1,341,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,11/05/1683,Fort,RAC,"Since I writt this morning I have received a letter from Charles Towgood that two Frenchmen that came downe last night have taken Captain Lumley and one interloper, and itt will not be long ere the other is taken and I am getting all the canoes I can for to gett the goods out of Captain Charles, soe in hast att present."
342,1,342,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,14/05/1683,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours, and as to a chirurgeon of an interloper being att Agga, there is one Richard Pearse, but I assure your honour there is none here, and indeed Mr Burrowes though unknowne to mee did send for him, or else noe interloper will come to this place. I suppose the blacks of Agga doe protect him, but if hee comes here I shall send him for Cabo Corsoe Castle. Truly itt was Mr Burrow's his fault, hee is verry weake and verry faint hearted, yesterday hee had his feavour verry voyolent. This morning I sold all the sheets I have, except about 6 old broken ones, and 48 blew and green perpetuano's, one with the other."
343,1,343,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,15/05/1683,Fort,RAC,"Last night arrived in Anishan roade one of the interlopers that the Frenchmen taken, most barbarously used, they told the canoemen that Captain Lumley lay att Lague, most desperatly wounded and his ship disabled. They have taken out all the goods, water etc., they lett only Captain Lumley and Captain Summervills ships goe. Agent Pearsons attendant and Captain Thompsons ships they tooke with them, they are resolved for to have a bout with the Companys ships att Arda, for they think they have gold chests, and they are resolved for to have them, soe thought fitt to acquaint your honour [so] that Captain Lumley may have some helpe sent him."
344,1,344,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,17/05/1683,Fort,RAC,"Last night came on shoare here Captain Thompson and his docter, that their ship was taken by the Frenchmen and they kept their ship. They most barbarously abused them, such punishments noe one never heard of, they put their yards in a vice and their thumbs, they say Captain Summervills mate wont live, they will informe your Honour of all passages. As per your former order I have sent them up to Cabo Corsoe Castle. The Arcany's have been att mee for more sheets."
345,1,345,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,23/05/1683,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday I received yours, whereby I understand [you] did wonder that Agga factory was not repaired. In answer, ever since I had your honours order, the next day I sent a white man and Blacks with thatch from hence and they had mended all the dwelling house, but the corne roome will aske a greate time for to fetch poules and thatch; besides itt must be ready to putt on before the old thatch be taken off, for feare the raines should wash the walls downe. I am sure there is never an English man here will say or write soe, but whomesoever did, did itt undeserving. Yesterday Mr Burrow's and Michael Millington went to Agga with their things. Mr Burrow's expects fresh goods from Cabo Corsoe, the goods proper for that place, iron barrs, and lead barrs, sayes, perpetuanoe's, sheets, course sletias, and what your honour thinke fitting. The Arcany's wants sheets and blew perpetuano's, for all the blew perpetuanoes I have are gon, for there is more green in a baile then blew, I have green, redd and printed perpetuanoes enough but they wont goe off here. There will want brandy for Mr Burrowes for I have but little, as alsoe paper and inke."

As to the pallavora about [var. att] Annamaboe itt is almost ended, yett the Capasheers has not taken away their trunks and boxes, my chamber being almost full of them."
352,1,352,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,07/07/1683,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours, and God willing by Captain Young I shall send what gold I have in cash.

When they come downe here they may make the bargaine themselves, for I bought once a 11 hand canoe for Captain Shepheard and hee left itt on my hands.

As to the 10 ounces itt had been sent before now, but I had not oppertunity, but God willing I shall send itt to morrow, and alsoe what gold I have of the Company's. Here is a greate deale of gold for fresh sayes and perpetuanoes, but they desire a larger quantity against Monday next."
365,1,365,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,20/09/1683,Fort,RAC,"This serves cheifly for covert to the enclosed August monthly account and alsoe the receipts for corne, all which I hope will find right and make note accordingly. This comes by Evan Price, by whome I have sent 32 marks, 1 ounce, 1 angle and 5 tacco's of good Arcany gold, whereof 10 marks, 1 ounce, 1 angle and 5 tacco's is on August accompt and 22 marks on September months accompt as per Mr Master's receipts will appeare.

I have received per the two 9 hand canoes, 10 bailes of perpetuano's and 5 bailes of sayes, and as soone as the breeze is over, the canoes shall goe for Cabo Corsoe this evening. I understand that there is arrived at the Mine a greate Dutch ship, and the Copeman of Cormanteen this day is gon to the Mine, soe would willingly have some more sayes and perpetuano's, as soone as possible, for they are only in request att present, that [I] may gett what gold I can before the Dutch goods come, the Blacks reckoning them the better dye and collours."
367,1,367,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,22/09/1683,Fort,RAC,"This day I have received yours, and alsoe by the two 9 hand canoes, 12 cases of sayes. I have taken here this day 8 marks odd ounces and att Agga 2 marks odd ounces, att both places in all this day 11 marks of good Arcany gold. I hope on Monday for to gett all the Arcany's good gold before the Dutch goods arrive here, I meane in these part. There is I beleeve a cheate with the packers att home, or elce the Captains of ships, for I opened in 4 of perpetuano's, and there was not one blew perpetuano in itt, I meane one in the 4 bailes, but 18 greens and 7 redds, and att Agga Francis Nixon had but 9 blews in two bayles, therefore I feare shall want some blew perpetuano's for to helpe off with these sayes, for I make them take one with the other. The Arcany's have promis'd to be here on Monday next. I doe what I can to advance the Company's interest."
368,1,368,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,25/09/1683,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours, and as to the greene perpetuano's I said there was two bailes opened, one here and one att Agga, that had only greene and redds in them, noe blews. On Satureday and yesterday I have taken here and att Agga in all upwards of 20 marks of good Arcany gold, soe that all the gold is gon till more comes out of the country, which I suppose may be on Monday next. This morning is gon by to Cormanteene a greate canoe loaden with goods and the Blacks saith the Dutch sayes are of a better dye then ours. If [sic] my opinion is that if the green perpetuano's were lowered to 9 angles, they would goe off and helpe to putt off our sayes and wee might bauke the Dutch, and itt would be better then they should lye for the cockroaches and moaths to eate them, they being a commodity that will not goe off att present. As to corne I have spoake to the Cabasheers and told them that att Commenda, Cabo Corsoe and other places, they sold for 1 [angle] a chest, but their answer is that wee have had but little raine this yeare and that they shall have but on[e] cropp this yeare and that Corne will be verry deare and they wont sell soe, not under 1 angle and halfe per chest. I desire to know how damnified goods goes off att Cabo Corsoe for gold or corne, that I may not make any error."
369,1,369,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,25/09/1683,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours, and I have made noate about the sheets. Yesterday I writt my opinion concerning greene perpetuano's and what our people said about corne. I understand the Dutch have most sayes come into these parts, soe if the greene perpetuano's be not lowered for to helpe off our sayes, I feare they will lye on hand, the Dutch sayes being of a better dye then ours. I desire to know how damnified goods goes off for gold or corne, but I dare not trust goods for corne here, if I should I never should see goods nor corne, for I have severall gold pawnes, I cannot gett them for to redeeme them and they are of a long standing."
370,1,370,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,26/03/1683,Fort,RAC,"Last night I received yours, and have made noate about lowering the prizes of goods, as soone as the Arcany's come downe, and doe not doubt but shall take money as well as the Dutch. I understand how goods were bartered for corne, but I dare not trust any goods, if should I never should see goods nor corne and they 
wont take 1 angle per chest. Yesterday all our Cabbasheers were att Anishan and they say that an Anishan canoeman was att Cape Tres Punctas, where is now two greate ships a takeing in wood and water, they say Portuguze and that there is English and French men aboard, they say will take the Dutch ships. I feare they are the pyrates come on the coast againe."
371,1,371,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,02/10/1683,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday I received yours, and as to old corne there is 225 chests at Agga. Captain Cole had all mine but 20 odd chests I keepe for my own spending. As I w[r]itt in my former letters, I cannot buy corne here under 1 angle and a halfe per chest, and our Capasheers will not sell under and I beleeve they buy up all the corne themselves. Last night came into this roade Captain Draper, hee saith hee will sett saile when the breaze comes in. This day thought lett him gett what corne hee can off, his boate is gon to Agga for his corne, for hee wont loose the windward currant. The ship that came downe the other day ly's in Anishan roade is an interloper, hee wont tell his ships name nor his owne, but the Blacks say they call him Captain James and hee snuffles in the nose, that is all I can learne of the Blacks. As to trade itt is verry small att present, for I have taken but one bendy this two dayes of trade and that was for iron barrs, but I hope when the interloper is gon and the Dutch sayes, I shall have a trade againe.
[PS] Captain Drapers 50 chests corne is all on board."
372,1,372,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,05/10/1683,Fort,RAC,"This morning I received yours, and as inordered, when Mr Sheares or Mr Groome comes shall put what slaves in [I] have in irons aboard. As to trade this weeke, has been verry small for I have taken but one bendy and that was in iron barrs. On Monday and Tuseday next, which is the dayes of trade with the Arcany's, I shall see what may be don. The Dutch sayes and sheets, the blacks like better then ours, but for corne here the Blacks will have one angle and halfe per chest, and if [you] will give mee an order for to give soe I may gett new corne, but otherwise I cannot, There is 205 chests of old corne att Agga, which is all is left."
373,1,373,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,27/10/1683,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday I received yours and imediatly I delivered Captain Browse his letters; hee sett sayle yesterday after dinner. As to the Royall Companys affaires, I thank God all is well but little gold stirring att present. Captain James the interloper for this fortnight hath spoyled the trade here, now the ships are gon I hope tradeing may be good againe."
374,1,374,Richard Thelwall,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,11/11/1683,Fort,RAC,"This morning I received yours, and as inordered I have sent a Whiteman to Amersa to see they make good measure and good shells. There is in Agga roade the old interloper Captain James. This is the fifth or sixth Monday hee hath beene here and if any money should come out of the country I feare [he] will spoyle the trade here."
375,1,375,Ralph Hassell,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,20/01/1681,Fort,RAC,"I had not been guilty of silence had I not this misfortune befallen mee which by the loss of upwards of 200 ounces of blood has soe weakened me that I have not been in a capacity to write to your Honour before now, which I hope will not be imputed as a crime to me. A soone as I am able shall by your order pay my due respects to you and bring up with me an exact accompt of all things belonging to my masters the Royall Affrican Company which I inventoryed at the takein charge of this factory, not being able to inlarge now."

377,1,377,Ralph Hassell,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,13/02/1681,Fort,RAC,"According to order have putt on board the Prosperous, Captain Henry Clarke Commander 9 woemen slaves and 140 musquetts, 300 chestes of corne which are the Company ['s], allso 2 peices firr and 60 peices of timber. I paid 2 ounces and 4 angles for them all and hope your Honour will allowe mee the same, which I begg your Honourr will signifie to mee by first oppertunity. What other goods are here are convenient for buying of corne, soe Mr Thelwall thinkes meete they remayne here. For what othere slaves are here four Arda men, one woeman, two boyes, which are requessett to bee here for to turne and shift the corne, nevertheless if you please to have two men up they shall come up by land, for they will not runn away. If you please to send a baile of tapseeles which will vend here for corne or money att 6a per peice, allsoe nicconees, wich goods doe not vend at Cape Corse. Here is left u[w]pards of 300 chestes of corne. I had a great deale of trouble in sending of the musquetts of[f], the people would not suffer for them to goe out of the factory and say nothing more shall goe, soe beleive within 2 or 3 dayes some of the Capusheires will be up with you."
378,1,378,Ralph Hassell,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,13/02/1681,Fort,RAC,"This comes per Captain Cophes people, who hath been here ever since I began to remove away goods for feare any molestation, which I mett with but little till the 140 musquetts went aboard. I advised your Honour this morninge of what corne slaves &ca are aboard Captain Clarke, which letter I deliverd to Captain Clarke. Here is now onely some iron barres, lead barrs, 12 narrow dammagged nicconnees, 4 red playnes, 7 verry corse sletias, 10 diglins and 5 brass panns old, and upwards of 300 chests corne, with 4 Arda men, 1 woeman and 2 boyes. The 4 men watch a nights, the woeman makes them cankey, the 1 boy is a cooke, the othere if occation serves to send on messages to Cape Coste.

379,1,379,Ralph Hassell,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,19/02/1681,Fort,RAC,"These comes to your hands per Captain Yankey, the Captain of Agga, who is sent to you on purpose per the King and Quontrees of Fanteene. They have been severall times with mee to buy goods, which I have not, and would know the reason why they cannot bee supplyd as formerly, butt that I sent the goods to Annamaboe, to which queries I made answer I followed my Generalls order, and reason'd with them as much as could and used as many forcible arguments to induce them to beleive theire was not any goods att Cape Corso to supply this place and other out factoryes, so they have sent the bearer to your Worship to dispute the buisness that they may be the better satisfyed.
The Cheife of thee Quontrees (which Griffin knowes what hee is) told me that if thee factory was not continued that there should bee noe trade at Annamaboe, for hee would stop the passage to Annamaboe, and that all boors should come and bring corne to this factory, and that they would take it in theire own hands and sell it to interloopers and purchase goods for themselves, soe that noe English ship for the future should have any corne and by that meanes theire voyages would be ruined. What their intentions are I leave it to your judicious consideratioons, this being the verrity of what was said to mee. Read it verbatem and lett Griffin interpritt it to the bearer, and he will verrifie the same. They binde me to stay as a pawne till the bearers returne."
380,1,380,Ralph Hassell,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,23/02/1681,Fort,RAC,"Yours I received per via Annamaboe from Mr Thelwall and understand what he wrote that the Quantrees man had said nothing to him about what I wrote you, which per adventure might cause a suspition in you that I should write the thinges that were erronious, butt in the future you will find the verrity confirmed. In Mr Belwoods time there were noe factor that had given security, which was the reason, nor Mr Belwood himselfe, and I quaere if it be not soe now. It will be noe discharge to mee to render an account to any one butt your selfe and the Royall Company, with whome I have contracted to that purpose. If I write not reason pray lett me begg the favour to know what I err in and it shall be rectifyed. Had I the goods that has been sent to Annamaboe I could remitt more money than ever has been remitted from thence, which if you had the accounts would appeare. Your Worship writes me not a woard aboute the slaves I sent per Captain Clarke, the musquettes and timber liekwise.
I could vend 10 or 12 barrells of powder for corne, allsoe tapseeles is required here, if your Worship please to send the great canoe with neccessaryes, as powder, tapseeles, nicconees etc., I will load here [= her] up with woode, which suppose may be wanted att Cape Corso for bricke, lyme etc., and if have your order can furnish you with what wood you shall want. I pray your candid construction of this for it is nothing butt verrity.
[PS] I begg an answer per messenger if you please to favour mee with one."
381,1,381,Ralph Hassell,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,01/01/1000,Fort,RAC,"In pursuance to your order with Councells of yesterdays dayte I have here inclosed sent an inventory of all the co[n]cerns of my masters the Royall Affrican Company of England at this place, which hope may be satisfactory.
Your Honour allsoe requires an account what goods sold till the 29 last past, which was onely 6 barrs iron and 1 corse sletia, which being soe small I transmitt it to this month account and remaine debitor till further order, and shall be as carefull for my masters intrest and my owne creditt as may render myselfe boath to theirs and yours good likeing. Here hath been these two dayes all the Capusheeres of this place, who dunns me much for the useuall custome of a new factors comeing to a factory, which they say and indeed hath been ever heretofore allowed. Theire demands are 1 anchor brandy, 1 perpetuanoe, 1 greene Welch playne or othere couler but red, and 3 yards blew broad cloth. I would not give any thing till I had your order, butt they are soe obstinate they will have that or as much, soe begg your answer and then I may govern myselfe as you shall perscribe. If your Honour can spare some course sletias, a bale of tapseeles amd perpetuanoes, with 200 barrs iron that are all markt, I question not but in a months time to take 20m of gold, for theise things are much inquired for per the Arcanyes that are now come downe."
382,1,382,Ralph Hassell,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,03/03/1681,Fort,RAC,"This comes per Coophe, who hath been rousawing his ground for corne and desired to be the bearer of a letter to your Worship, though have onley to informe you that yesterday I delivered my months account to Mr Thelwall and yesterday Captain Bowler sayld, aboard whome I putt 2 boyes and furnished him with what wood he wanted, which was 670 sticks. When I demanded a receipt he would give it lieu of timber put ashoar at Cape Corso, which I was unwilling to take till I had Mr Thelwalls approbation. I have rumiged and found the othere musquett, which sent per the bearer. I could wish a supply of goods such as you can best spare, for now I have nothing butt lead, iron, playnes 2 ps, and 10 diglins. I bought a considerable quantity of corne last month, it begins to be scarce, that quantity is good. I want some powder, tapseeles broad, and nicconees, blew bafts, if you please to send them to Annamaboe, and what other sort of goods you please."
383,1,383,James Cunduitt,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,04/10/1681,Fort,RAC,"The Cabisheers came to mee to demand the reason why the factory was withdrawne. I declared I did not know but did beleeve the unkindness was the cause. I did declare the covenant was broke that they made with Agent Mellish at the settlement of the same, which covenant I did declare in regard I was present at the same time, and some other wrongs which the Company have received, soe Braffo and Quantrees and Cabisheers of Abbra and Cabisheers of Agga and Mareens doe declare they will make good the covenant they made with Agent Mellish, which covenant is this, that noe slaves shall be carryed aboard any interloper whatsoever but first brought into the factory, and they shall have the refusall of them, and that noe money shall be carryed aboard any interloper, and if any one doe the goods shall be seazed by the Marens for the Braffo and Company, which covenant was in force since I came to Agga to live, and I can give an account how it was broke, that noe interlopers men shall be suffered to come to Agga ashoare but be panyard. They desire that Mr Thelwall be chiefe and I may remayne with him. The Braffo will imploy some to looke after the factory that shall pay for what goods are stole and what slaves brake away, if not taken shall be paid for, and what lost in old Braffo's time this Braffo will not concerne himselfe with. The Cabisheers would not be satisfied unless I would write to your honour about this, for which I hope your honour will pardone my boldness in soe doeing. This new Braffo hath been a trader with the English in my time, I doe know him. They desire your answer and will further waite uppon your honour as you will appoint. There was severall present att the writting hereof, and they have been with Mr Thelwall about this business."
384,1,384,Thomas Burrows,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,08/07/1683,Fort,RAC,"I have yours of the 7th instant, and am sorry to heare that my practices or behaviour amongst the Blacks, now I have given them almost halfe I have in the country, should be soe ill as to cause any of them to give your honour falce reports of mee. I can safely say I have not a word of differance with any black since I came to this place, which your Honour may be better inform'd by the Whitemen that has lived with mee. You are pleased to tax mee with entertaining the master of an interloper. Its true that since I came here that one Hudson, whoe was master of an interloper from Barbado's, came ashoare here and being my verry entimate freind told mee hee made bold to come up to the house to see mee, haveing a letter for mee from Barbado's. I desired him to goe from hence, which accordingly hee did, and I am sure was not halfe an houre ashoare. I was not att that time capeable to entertaine him or to seize him, haveing the feavour and ague. Upon the next day hee writt mee a noate ashoare per a black that [being] formerly acquaintance and seeing mee to be a new beginer to house keeping, hee had sent mee a sow pigg and 3 Muscoval ducks. Mr Sheares comeing here since told mee the ducks belonged to your Honour, and that Captain Clarke heard Hudson say they were sent you from Barbado's, which has ever since been a trouble to mee that hee should give mee your present, although att first I designed to present them to you, but when Mr Sheares told mee the ducks was your honours I was resolved to know the truth of itt and spake with Captain Clarke before I sent them. I hope you will not any wayes take this amiss of mee, for I protest had there been the least word of sending them to you as a present from Barbado's spoken to mee, I would not have kept them 12 houres. I have per bearer sent the 3 ducks and a douzen of good fowles with them, which I hope you will please to except of, and hope your honour will harbour noe ill thought of mee for that action, haveing writt the whole truth of itt, and as for the selling of slaves itt was more then could doe for I have not bought any since I came here. Itts true a boy that I had before I came to Cabo Corsoe, att my first comeing here had stolen severall things from mee and haveing whipt him, [he] run away from mee for two dayes, and rashly and foolishly I sent him aboard ship and sold him for rum, which I have often since repented, and hope your Honours pardon, haveing writt you the whole truth to every passage, but suppose the informer might make an addition to them. I doe not expect to doe the least thing that hold can be taken of, but itt will be immediatly carryed to your Honour, for I am much envyed by comeing here, but not by the Blacks but whites. Mr Thelwall taxes mee much with informing your honour against him, and that particularly I writt that hee had cursed you and spoken verry ill words of you; I begg your Honour to favoure mee soe farr with a line or two for to cleare mee of itt, for without hee will not be satisfied. If should wrighte any such thing I should be a verry greate rogue, for I never heard him say ill of you. His man Francis [i.e. Nixon?] justifies itt, and sayes hee had itt from credible people att Cabo Corsoe. I have delivered in my last months accompt, and tooke upwards of 15 marks of gold besides the corne. I hope this month will prove noe worse."

Satureday being the 13, at 10 of the clock wee came to Wyamba and went to the towne and found noe person in it, for they were run to Sanya but 15 miles distance from Wyamba, soe wee went by land and there found James Mills and the Wyamba people, and wee stayed there all Sonday, and Monday morning departed and came to Wyamba with part of the Wyamba men, and the next day they are all intended to come to Wyamba. The cause of their runing away was the reason that the Anguinnas had kild and taken of Momford people 183 and they are affraid of the Accrongs. I would not have your worshipp send any goods till I heare further, for to morrow I will send a man to Accrong and another to both Anguinnas, and if they have done their pallavora I shall acquaint your worshipp with itt. As for expence here will be some hereafter, for haveing noe time I cannot acquaint better, and by relation of the Wyamba Cabasheers Mr Nightingalle had the Anguinna Cabashers and the Accrong and the Lague Cabasheers here at Wyamba, and gave them dasheys and spent largly on them and made the said Cabasheers all take their fittish to be true and trusty to thee Royall Affrican Company of England and their concerns before hee brought any goods ashoare or settled the factory. As concerning the house itt is in a bad condition, for there is noe doores nor windows in it, but Gallansa and John Grandy will make itt serve till there be a better made."
386,1,386,Hugh Sheares,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,18/08/1681,Fort,RAC,"This is to give your worshipp an account [that] this morning about 3 of the clock came here Captain Phipps and Mr Wendover and Mr Nightingale and James Mills and Nicholas Battrell but came not on shoare. I spake with them but they went straite for Accra. This day is come Atta Barba9 from Anguinna and hee tells mee that within 3 or 4 dayes to the most all will be well, and that the Accrongs will give them pawnes and they likewise to the Accrongs for to be true one to the other. As for the man sent for Accrong I heare nothing of him as yett but expect him every houre. As for the townes people there is none but Gallansa and his people and some of John Grandy's, soe haveing nothing to trouble your worshipp but by the next conveniency you shall heare better."

This morning came into this road an interloper."
388,1,388,Hugh Sheares,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,28/08/1681,Fort,RAC,"This is to give your worshipp an account of Wyamba people that they would not like to come together, for the Accrongs give them onely faire words and promise them pawnes for nothing but for them to come together, and then doe by them as the Anguinnas did by the Momford people. Thursday last the Queens people were here and brought some slaves for powder and lead, and other people with some slaves but all woemen for powder likewise, and money for other goods. Soe they told mee the Queen would have mee goe and live to Sanya and write to your worshipp for goods, and there should be as good a trade as if wee were here till the trouble be over. I told them that I could not goe, for my orders was for Wyamba, and told them that your worshipp would be angry with mee and punish mee for goeing there without your knowledge. They told mee that if I came to damage your worshipp would be angry with them, and they should gett noe whiteman to live with them againe, and told mee that I must goe, and soe they went away for Sanya and there ordred canoemen to come this day to carry my things by watter and bring mee by land, which I expect every moment, and soe I hope your worshipp will not be angry with mee, but as for the place if you please to send goods itt is more secure, for the people that belong to itt now can defend againe ten thousand that shall oppose them, for itt is naterally strong, and but two waies to come to the towne and but two a breast att most and three or four gates each way before you gett in, soe I hope your worshipp will send goods to Sanya. Your two hand canoe came here Fryday about 3 of the clock but itt was broke. I beleeve they gott to Accra this last night about midnight.

As for them slaves delivered Captain Lowe as per his receipt [it] was to help make up his complement, by reason I had sould 1720 lbs weight of booges before your Honours letter came to my hands, as per January accompt, which were for 33 caske of booges, them 8 slaves amounting to 504 pounds, soe that there are still wanting to compleat your orderes 1216 pound, an accompt of which he promised to give your Honour per his first from Ardoe.

The goods not belonging to the Royall Company shall be sold as fast as possible.
Your last was of the 2nd instant per Mr Franckland, from whome I received one of the 28 of February being ane order for Mr James Nightingale to reiceive 200 brails and 20 white long cloths to be shippt on board Captain Bowler.
And in ansewer to them I have sent to him at Wyamba 20 white long cloths and lickwise what brails were remaining, which were 120 as my February accompt will manifest, which your Honour will reeceive from the bearer Richard Griffith, the Company apprentice, with whome comes one Anthony Meadows [a] maison, a refractory person who threatens that upon a misdemeanor tis but runing to the Portugueze forte. Here are some otheres, but for them I shall not trouble your Honour with untill the time comes that I shall have the happiness of kissing your hand, which shall not be long.
I have marked your prices of provisions and desier that I shall have a supply of them according to my noat of perticulars.
[PS] By February accompt your Honour will find thee great want that here are of goods, for what were vendable are all gone, as course sletias, brails, Ginny clouts and alsoe long cloths, soe that what remaines will not maintaine the factory without a supply, for the whole dependance that we have relyes uppon iron and tappseels, which sell but sloly. If there be any goods that can be spared for God sake lett us have them, as sayes, perpetuanoes blews [and] greens, brails, carpetts, blanketts, pewter baisons, allijars, sletias course or fine, sheets, or any sorts of linnens, as long cloths good ones."
394,1,394,Arthur Wendover,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,29/03/1681,Fort,RAC,"Your Honours of the 5th instant I have received, and understand I made noe mention, in mine of the 20 of February as concerning the powder belonging to Agent Bradley, which is 11 barrells and one halfe, but of the other tonn which my account per Mr Frankland makes mention of I doe not know to whome they belong, but I suppose they are the Companys and ought soe to be charged.
I have alsoe received one of the 19 instant with one for Mr James Nightingale, who is at Alampa, wherein your honour orders what gold is remaining in my hands, to be sent home per Captain Bowler to bee consigned to the Companys factors Edwin Steed and Stephen Gascoyne Esquires at Barbadoes, which shall be done, but then the people must remaine unpaid for a considerable time, by reason of the great want wee have of goods, the whole dependenace being only in tapseels and iron barrs, which are very dull comoditys in this place.
As for your canoe that came with Mr Wender, it was as cheape as possible I can gitt one here, but he told me that he would be at the charge himself; and alsoe the medecines for the forts use cost (bona fides) 5 ounces on board Captain Bell, and had I not had them I myself or others might have perrished, but I have charged but 3 oz and there is enough for two 12 months.
Mr Kyte was gone from hence before your last came to my hands, with the New England man, Captain Bowler refusing to carry him unless he would deposite 6 pees, which he was not able to doe.
This canoe which is the bearer one [= on] Saterday last came from Alampa, per order of Mr James Nightingale, with 5 peices of sayes and 24 blew pottkeys, they being for Gallanca at Wyamba. Coming ashore at the Dutch landing per the Accra people [they] were all paniard, but upon what account wee know not. Wee sent to them to know the reason, a base daring answer was returned, that we should provide ourselves with watter and doe our worst. Imediatly wee sent two shott into the towne, and left of firing, it being night; all Sunday wee fought them, and killed one man and wounded some others, and likewise part of Monday, the Quamboo people being very helpful, for as God would have it they ware downe, but at last wee forced them to bring in all to our great contentment.
The time we were ingaged, wee ware forced to send the 5 hand canoe to the Portuguize for watter, for want of that necessary in this factory by reason our tank is not finished, the want of which wee desire may be seriously considered of, for these base rascalls will alwayes be doing one mischeife or other, they knowing the want wee have of watter, our dayly send 8 miles for every drop wee drink; also [we need] some shott and match."

Heere are noe slaves, but what you left are still remaining."
396,1,396,James Nightingale,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,25/05/1681,Fort,RAC,"Your Honours and Councells much estemed dated the 25th instant came safe to my hands, wherein I perceeve your Honour and Councells order to take in my possession the fort and merchandise and all other goods belonging to Mr Wendover or any parson else into my charge.
Where upon imediately comeing from on bord Captain Bowler after haveing dispatched him, [I] called up every man, to be understood both Blacks and whits, belonging to the Royal African Company of England and read before [them] your Honour and Councells order. They all tould mee they would observe it and they acknowledged mee to be their Cheif tell further order from your Honour and Councell, where upon wee hysed up the flagge, fiered 5 guns and drank your Honour and Councells good health.
Your Honour and Councell will find per this inclosed invoice what goods are in the Castle belonging to the Royall African Company and other persons, but I doe ashure your Honour and Councell that I cannot find out those perticular to whome th[e]y belong, I have examined every person in the fort.
I give your Honour and Councell most humble and hearty thanks that you have bine pleased to intrust me with this charge. Your Honour and Council may rest assured that neither Dutch, Portugues or Blacks shall take any advantage of us, I will give noe afront nor take any, and as for the trade will doe my uytmoost indeavor for the profitt and creditt of your Honour and Counsell.
The Docter Samuell Stone shall have command according your Honours order both for lodging and dyett.
Just now the Blacks hearing I was hear came with some gould for our goods. I ordered Mr Frankland to take itt to avoid all suspition. By the blessing of God Almighty I hope toe procure a trade here again.
Ahenessa sent to me this day and desired a good correspondence. His people be about 50 in number. They also tould mee the Dutch Copeman Van der Lypfe hinder them from comeing to our fort for trading, not onely that, but orders his Blacks being a great number to stale our hodges [= hogs], sheep or what they can lay their hands upon. Nay he is soe convident that he rights to Mr Sheers at Alampo that some white men of our fort, nay the Copeman himself shall suffer the death of a certain person which was killed. I have his own letter.
My small opinion is that you right to his master the Gennerall of the Minna of his unhandsome action, to prevent for the future.
[PS] I also send your honour an account signed by Mr Hollings and my selfe of the goods wee had from Cape Cors. In the remains you will find wanting 2 pieces of sayes, 4 perpetiaens, 25 pieces tapseels and 45 pottkeys, which aforesaid goods has since the aforesaid account was signed, since I bought slaves at Wimba, deduktes 3 months canky mony for 7 canoe men [and] my owne dyett, as I shall give your Honour an account per the next. I had a great deal of trouble with Bowler. Pray take it not unkindly that I doe it not now.
[PS] Here being noe brandy in the Castle, desire your Honour to send a hogshead. Whatt wee had here was put on bord of Captain Bowler according order."
397,1,397,Francis Franckland,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,25/05/1681,Fort,RAC,"Yours under 12 instant I have received and am sorry that you should beleeve I should be concern'd with Mr Wendover in acting anything contrary to the interest of our masters the Royall Affrican Company. What I know touching Mr Wendover is as followeth, and the reason of my not acquainting you with it sooner was the want of an oppertunity and I thought it not worth while to send a canoe on purpose. Mr Wendover did sell unto Captain Mathews 4 woemen slaves for sayes [and] perpetuanoes, and did also buy more for gold, the woemen was the same you take notice of was denied Captain Bowler and I must doe Mr Wendover the justice to say they were not denyed by him but mee (he being at that time very sick) and I will if required take my oath that at that time they were not slaves but pawnes, as was then told to Captain Bowler, and that when Ahenesa sent downe his son to sell them he also sent that Mr Wendover should send them a board the first ship, and if hee refused to take them away and sell them to the Dutch or Portuguese. Captain Mathews being then in the roade, Ahenesas son would have them sent a board before he went.
As to Mr Wendovers sending a letter to Captain Mathews at Mingo, hee to my knowledge never did, and for helping him to the slaves out of the Portuguese he nor I knew nothing of nor was concern'd in any way with the buying or selling them. Mr Wendover did further buy out of Captain Mathews 2 great guns for the defence of the fort, because the Accras dayley play the rogue with us, and there being never a gun in the fort that will carry far enough to command them. Hee also bought out of the New England man (whoe was in the roade when wee fought the Accraers and without whose helpe wee could not have got water) some pork and pease. As to what you take notice of concerning the powder that was hiding in the souldiers roomes when I tooke an account of the goods att this place, that was noe fault of mine, for I went as far as my orders gave me leave and gave an exact account of what I found, and had any one told mee of them I should have put them in my account with the rest."
398,1,398,Francis Franckland,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,25/05/1681,Fort,RAC,"Yours under 19th and 21st instant have received and am sorry for Mr Wendovers sake that soe ill a business should happen. I acquainted the Agent in my letter to him per Mr Wendover of what I knew touching the slaves etc., as also the reason of my not writting of it sooner, which I hope will satisfie him, for I doe assure you it is true and that for the future I will never be guilty of the like, for if noe opportunity presents I will send a canoe on purpose. I cannot be so large to you as I would, being much importuned by Mr Nightingale (nay commanded) to goe aboard an interloper now in the roade, aboard whom he hath bought severall things, as a watch, wine, beare etc. of one Mr Harvey and one Mr Edlin. I doe beleeve he hath noe good meaning to mee in being soe earnest to have mee goe a board, whether itt be to informe the Agent of it or to make mee as culpable as himself I know not, but be it how it will I care not, for shall by you give the Agent an acount of it, being the best way to keepe pease and quietness here, and therefore I desire if you think convenient to show the Agent this and hee may act as hee sees cause.
I take notice what you writt touching Captain Phipps and Mr Stone (who is safe arrived here) and shall doe what lies in my power to serve the Captain.
[PS] Here inclosed I have sent you Mr Nightingales note which hee would have had mee carry aboard, but with much adoe I excused it by writting a note by his command which you have also inclosed, and I can prove that I was commanded to doe itt by him. I beleeve in a day or twos time I shall trouble you with another by a canoe on purpose, for Mr Harvey is now ashoare by his invitation, though att the Dutch fort, and hee hath been with him att the Portuguese fort and commanded mee to stay with him at the Dutch fort and in the mean time would have sent away the canoe had not the canoemen accidentally staid till I come.

I received a letter from the Agent per said Mr Wendover and desire you to doe mee the kindness to give my hearty thanks for his kindness and asshure him that for the future I will not be guiltie of the like misdemeanor and shall be shure to observe his command in all things, and also further acquaint him that I made a further inquiry after what I write you in my last touching the bearer hereof Mr Nightingalle, and that I find that hee gave for a watch to Mr Harvey 1 man slave and to one Turner, a Dutch interloper, a boy for a caske of wine. He also told mee that hee gave for women slaves at Allampo 4 tapsells, 1 sheet, which is good [for] 1 bendie, 1 angle and a halfe, for a tapsell is never sold under 6 angles at Allampa, and at the same time the Dutch bought for 5 pease. There was also the other day in the roade one Doegood, an interloper, who sent his mate ashoare to him to know what hee wanted. He treated the mate very civilly and sent the docter off with him to buy a quarter cask of wine, which he did. I should have writ this to the Agent himselfe had I had another conveyance, but he carrying it himselfe [I] fear'd least he should suspect the truth and not deliver it. Pray give my service to Mr Spurvay, Mr Stapleton Captain Phipps and the rest of the Gentlemen with you and tell Captain Phipps I will write to him per Mr Wendover, and answer his desire.
[PS] I have sent you by the bearer a boy. He is not so handsome as I could wish he were but is the best I could gett, therefor hope you will accept the will for the deede."
400,1,400,Francis Franckland,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,08/07/1681,Fort,RAC,"Your worshipp and Councells letter under the 2nd instant received per Mr Pley, and give you my hearty thanks for your kindness in makeing mee chiefe of this place and doe asshure you I will take all the care imaginable to advance the interest of the Royall Company my masters, and doe not question (if can gett goods) but to take as much gold as any factory upon the coast. I take notice of what your worshipp writes touching Mr Pleys being second etc. and shall observe your orders in every particular. I shall also take care to use my endeavour to regaine the affection of the blacks in this place (who I can asshure you are a company of great rogues from whome comes noe trade, and whosoever lives here must keepe them in feare of himself or elce hee must keepe nothing here) but more especially of Ahenesa (from whome all the trade comes), who I intend to goe see, as soone as Mr Wendover is well to goe up with mee, whoe hath been extreamly ill of a voiolent feavour in soe much that wee looked every day for his death but praised be God he is something better, when he is in a condition shall observe your order to send him up, Ahenesa haveing sent severall times for he that was made Chiefe, and for Mr Wendover. Here inclosed I send your worshipp an account of what goods remained in my warehouse when Mr Wendover was made incapable of his imployment, also what slaves etc. belongs to the fort, with last months account, which you will find to be very small (the Quomboers not comeing downe), and your worshipp will find by the account of goods what goods was received from aboard Captain Bowler, also what slaves delivered said Captain. (I have seen a great many goods come out of shipps but doe asshure your worshipp never see any come out in such a condition, being most of them spoyl'd by carelessness.) In my account I have given the Company creditt for the goods etc. received from aboard Captain Bramfill (but know noe price of the provisions) and shall in my next give them creditt for the corne received from the 15 hand canoe, haveing scarce enough corne in the castle to last 4 dayes. Before she came I had sent a 5 hand canoe to Wyamba to fetch corne but there was none to be had.
I have according to your order sent what damnified goods is in the warehouse, but for the potkeys they are all sold, and had I more could have sold them. The price of them I knew not onely as Mr Nightingale told mee that I should sell them at an angle per peece, but you will find by my account I have got more for them. When Mr Wendover is in a condition shall observe your worshipps order about his goods, an account of which you receive with the rest. I writt your worshipp about 5 dayes since per a 2 hand canoe on purpose for to acquaint you in what distress wee were in for corne, but the canoe was unfortunately cast away. The men saved their lives and got to Wyamba where they got another canoe, but the weather proving very bad was forc't to put in at Momford neare Dague [var. Tague], where they panyard the men and kept them severall dayes, but at last they sent one of them downe to tell mee that except I sent them 10a I should not have the man againe. I sent the mony by the 5 hand canoe when she went to Wyamba to corne and sent for the man but could heare nothing of him, he was one of the pawnes of the fort. If any canoe comes from your worshipp they had best have a care of touching there for they will serve them in the same manner. I doe not question but in a few dayes to have some of them in the fort, and if have will make them pay severly.
[PS] I have sent per this conveyance 25 long cloths damnified and 2 tapsells."

I am hearty sorry that I should give your worship the trouble of a second time remembring me of the money I had att Cape Corsoe, but doe asshure your worship I sent per Mr Wendover when he was last with you, but his troubles made him forget to give it you. I have sent it per Peter the canoeman, as also a hee and shee goate with a black boy which I would beg of your worship to accept. The boy is the best I can gett at present, when goe up to Ahenesa shall endeavour to gett you another. This fort is very much out of repaire, one flanker being falen in and two more is proped up, and also severall things wanting which is too long to give an account in writting per this conveyance. If I thought your worship would not take it ill I would come up to Cape Corsoe and acquaint your worship in what a condition the place is in per word of mouth, and also acquaint your worship which way it might be made good at a small charge, to last for severall years whereas now it is repairing every day. If your worship think convenient of my comeing up I can come in the canoe with Mr Wendover.
[PS] One thing I had almost forgot to acquaint your worship with, that is when Mr Nightingalle was here cheife that he ordered me to give the Docter 2o 2ata to goe aboard Doogood to buy wine, which I could not denie. I would not charge itt in the Company account without your worships leave but hope your worship will not let me loose itt, itt not being in my power to withstand his order.

Samuel Stone James Fort, Accra,10 July 1681
Mr Nightingale did desire mee that I would say that Mr Franckland was in as much fault as Mr Wendover, and did desire that I would aske and inquire of John Clarke of all the transactions in itt, [he] being an acquaintance of mine formerly, that hee would tell mee and that I should send to him about itt, for hee did not question but hee should be chiefe here and it should be the better for me. I do know nothing of this concerning Mr Franckland with Mr Wendover in the least."
402,1,402,William Pley,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,14/07/1681,Fort,RAC,"Haveing received a letter per the Dutch canoe from Captain Bramfill from Allampo, and not knowing what importance the contence might be (Mr Franckland being gon up to Comboe to Ahenesa, being sent for by one of his sons), I humbly thought itt my duty to dispatch a canoe with itt, not doubting of your worships approbation therein. Mr Franckland hath not yett overhal'd the warehouse since my arrivall here, but hath promised to doe itt when hee returnes, however just at his departure hee left me the key of the warehouse, which I was forst to take, there being none elce to doe it, hopeing Mr Franckland will prove as honest to mee in that respect, as I will be always true and faithfull to my charge, and the Company and your worships interest. Hee likwise tells mee he hath noe gold chest (only a small trunk), soe that I can have noe key to that corespondent to your worships and Councells order. As Mr Wendover hath for some time past been almost at the point of death but is now much better, yet so extreame weake that Mr Franckland durst not venture on the consideration to send him up to Cape Corsoe as yet. When Captain Rickards comes downe here, I will use my utmost endeavour with the boatswayne, and others, to heare of Mr Spurvays brandy, and will send an attestation (witnessed) about itt."
403,1,403,William Pley,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,18/07/1681,Fort,RAC,"Your worships packett to Mr Franckland arrived here yesterday morning by the 2 hand canoe, and at his returne from Quomboe (which wee hourly expect) shall be delivered him, in whose absence I take the greatest care possible of the forts wellfare, he having three whitemen with him. I wrote your worship Fryday last, to which I shall refer."
404,1,404,William Pley,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,13/08/1681,Fort,RAC,"Understanding by a canoe which came to this place from Cape Corsoe the indisposition of Mr Franckland, I humbly presume to trouble your worshipp with this letter, in which I have sent a true list of the goods that were in the warehouse when overhall'd by Mr Franckland at his departure (fearing through sickness hee may omitt itt). For the muskets, powder etc. I have as yet noe account of them, neither have I as yet (nor I beleeve I shall not) sell any till Mr Francklands returne, for till then wee shall have noe trade with the Quomboers (on whome almost our whole trade depends), of which I suppose your worshipp understands the reason ere this. I should make itt my business to be exact carefull and honest in the account expected from mee since Mr Francklands departure, which (the promises[?] considered and the great want of vendable goods) your worshipp cannot expect very considerable. However I am resolv'd my care both in that particular [and] the forts wellfare, and all my other actions shall declare how great my resentment is of the infinit favours your worshipp hath been pleas'd to heap on me. Wee have had very sickly season here since Mr Francklands departure, the Docter and most of the men in the fort have been very ill, but I bless God all upon their leggs againe except one (John Clarke) of whose recovery we dispaire, and hourly expect his death by the flux. The Accraers att the Dutch Towne and the Dutch themselves (whoe are it seems threatned too) expect Ahenesas comeing upon them, the blacks lying in the Dutch fort, and makeing great fiers in the night. Whether this may be a falce allarme or not wee are ignorant, and though wee are assured from all hands, that Ahenesa hath noe thoughts (but of amity) concerning this fort, yet I humbly hope our utmost care, both in good watching and putting our selves in the best posture of defence we can, will not be amiss."
405,1,405,Samuel Stone,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,17/08/1681,Fort,RAC,"I presume to send this canoe to acquaint your worshipp that Mr Pley is taken dangerous sick of a feavour and a voiolent vomiting, which I thought to acquaint your worshipp of itt, this being the 3rd day of his sickness. I would desire the Docter might send mee these medicines that I shall write him for by this canoe. I would desire your worshipp might dispatch the canoe with all speede. The reason of my wanting medicines is wee have had all the men in the castle sick with myselfe alsoe, but now praised be God wee are all in pretty good health againe except Mr Pley. This day wee have buried one John Clarke who dyed of a voiolent feavour."
406,1,406,James Nightingale/ George Phipps,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,27/08/1681,Fort,RAC,"This is to give your honour an account of our arrivall here being the 18th instant, where wee found Mr Pley and most of our whitemen very sick. The first wee undertooke was with all speed to gett the fort in good order. We have mended both our flankers [and] gott in the fort wood, water and stones. Afterward being the 21 instant wee send a person to Ahenesa to know his demands against Mr Wendover, and if ditto Ahenesa send his son Boebie or any other person here to make his pallavora should by us come and goe free back againe, but as yett wee received noe answer. Here is a generall report by both Dutch and the Governour of the Portuguese that Ahenesa has divided his army in 3 parts and intends in person with his party for our forte, the two other generalls the one for the Dutch the other for the Portuguese. Wee will doe our indeavour if they come, if not will if itt is possible to put by all differance to procure a trade againe, but we doe assure your honour itt will not be easily done, for this factory has been abominably abused by our Company servants, as your honour will assurly find. Your honour will be pleased to send us for the use of the fort one hogshead brandy [and] some beefe, wee have not a dram of brandy in the fort and drink nothing but stinking water. I send your honour the accounts of remaines found here. Pray send the canoe with all speede back againe. Our canoemen are all quartered on the foure flankers."
407,1,407,James Nightingale,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,27/07/1681,Fort,RAC,"This onely to give you an account as that Mr Wendover demands from Ahenesa 9m 7o 5a, soe that I beleeve his beloved girl will balance the accounts, for I heare Ahenesa demands 40 bendys. This factory has been abominably abused, and further I can assure your honour itt will be not a little trouble to resettle it againe. Ahenesa is our enemy on the one side and the Accra people on the other. Your honour will find likewise per the account of remaines that Mr Franckland has sold a great deale of goods, with what hee received of Captain Bramfill, but here is noe gold in cash only 2 or 3 ounces.

I will doe my endeavour to reconcile differance, to be understood as far as itt is for the profitt and creditt of our masters the Royall Company. Wee doe expect news from Ahenesa every houre. When I know his demands and wee come to a pallavora, shall per the 2 hand canoe give your honour an account. I am very lame and one of my feet allmost spoyl'd with thee journy to Barracoe. Your honour be pleased to assist us what you can, for ther is here nothing to be gott, onely stinking durty water. Wee all expect Ahenesa with his armye every houre but wee keepe a good watch with our whitmen, slaves and canoemen."
408,1,408,William Pley,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,08/09/1681,Fort,RAC,"I bless God I have overcome a desperate and dangerous feavour (under which I hav a long time linguished) soe far as I am againe uppon my leggs, though soe weake I am scarce able to stand.
Though Mr Frankland is dead yet must needs complaine of a very grosse abuse he has put on mee in two or three particulars of the invoice of goods he gave mee at his departure, for haveing severall times desireing him to overhall the warehouse hee still put mee off till the very instant of his departure to Capo Corsoe, and then he went into the warehouse with a penn and ink, and in an hurry, would not suffer mee to overhall all the goods, especially the pottkeys, but made mee sett them downe as hee dictated, and hee being my supperiour I could not helpp itt, but hee protested the truth of itt. I confess I was much dissatisfied, but was induct to beleeve him, not knowing his actions then as I have heard since, for which I am sorry. I feared the pottkeys at first, because hee made and gave soe many of them away, soe that upon the tale of them since I find 24 less then hee assured mee there was. That this is true I call the God of truth to witness and I hope your Worshipp will beleeve mee, for in the presence of God I wish I may forfeit my eternall happyness if any goods hath gone out of the warehouse more than my enclosed account makes out since Mr Franklands departure. I must confess the thoughts of being so overcatcht by one I thought my friend, was a great trouble to mee in my sickness, but God that knowes the secreets of my soule knows my inocence too, and I hope your worshipp will not suffer mee to come to any damage where I am guiltless, through the unequall dealings of my superiour, since I never yett did wrong to any man, but will still make itt my great endeavour to answer your worshipps goodness to mee, in my dilligence and fidellity as long as I live. Another mistake he made was, hee gave me an account but of 10 Guynie clouts, when (under other goods) there was 82. And in his account 19 paper brawles, when there was but 7 This is the errors and God knows (and others here) occationed by Mr Frankland, the rest is right, onlely divers goods cutt by him for cloaths etc. Besides of the 39 peeces of tapsele 3 (that were on the shelfe, and reckoned to mee) were owned, and prooved, to be due to a black for cows Mr Frankland had bought and delivered per order since Mr Nightingalls arrivall. I was sent hither by your worshipp in a time of very intricate and clandestine dealeings (as appears since), though I was kept ignorant, and I thank God inocent of all, but I hope for the future wee shall have noe more such base transactions here, which wee'll use all imaginable care to prevent. Enclosed is my account since Mr Frankland departure, and Mr Nightigalls receipt for the money what goods were sold while Mr Frankland was there. I constantly gave him the money, as I received itt, and hee tooke an account of the goods delivered (as I suppose Mr Wendover can informe your worshpp) and told mee hee would make itt up in his account. If hee hath not done it and your worshipp require itt I can doe it out of my booke. Two slaves bought by Mr Frankland hath died in his absence.
I most humbly begg your worshipps pardone for my tediousness and bad writting, which is occasioned by my sickness, and doe most humbly and heartyly thank your worshipp for your great goodness to mee.
[PS] I doe assure your honour all this above I have heard reported by severall to be true.

409,1,409,James Nightingale ,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,01/01/1000,Fort,RAC,"Your Honours much esteemed dated the 25th August and the other the 31st ditto have received, wherein I was very sorry to heare the death of my friend Mr Frankland, and since your Honour and Councill have been pleased to make mee Chiefe of this fort, wherefore I give your Honour and Councill most humble and hearty thanks, worthy Gentlemen you may rest assured that I shall doe the utmost of my endeavour to procure a trade againe, but itt can not be done without trouble and some small charges, wherein I will be as spaireing as possible I can, and as for my accounts your Honour will find them at all times to agree with the warehouse, for I doe not intend to trust the blacks nor run out the Company's goods or trade with interlopers.
Captain George Phipps and I have according to order sold Mr Franklands goods at publique outcry, as per account will appeare, wee have found noe money then 5a in gold in his chest or elcewhere. What provisions out of Captain Bramfild I found here, according the account shall give the Company creditt. Docter Stone I have displac't according to order and have paid him 4 months pay at 9a lta per month
Mr Wendover hath with mee and Captain Phipps overhall'd the warehouse two times, wherein wee found no more goods as have given your Honour account the 27th August last, only 60 iron barrs more belonging to Mr Frankland, whereof 10 is paid for the debts he owes as per ballance of account will appeare. Mr Wendover will give your Honour an account of all actions and transactions, alsoe the account of the wanting of goods which comes to M 12.5 gold, besides provisions.
In answer of 31 August: Wee were informed Ahenesa would be downe with us with 3 armies, but wee hope it is but a lying report, however if it be or not wee are provided for them as much as possible wee can. I have received 59 gallons of brandy and shall give the Company creditt.
Mr Wendover hath had all the freedome imaginable to make up his pallavora with Ahenesa, as will appeare.
I send your Honour an inventory of Mr Franklands goods, which [we] found here, the account at what rates they were sold att, the account of paying the garrison 2 months pay beginning the 22nd July and ending the 16 September, an inventory of Mr Wendovers goods and chatties, and the pallavora with Ahenesa of our proceedings.
Goods wanting here: sheets, brawles, carpetts, and blanketts of all sorts, perpettuanes, tapsells, allejars, ginghams, pewter juggs, longees, red ground pin-tadoes, yallow beads, brandy, some bright musketts and good powder, for almost here is much damnified, fine and course sletias, cowryes, and longcloath. Pray let Captain Phipps send mee my goods in the 5 hand canoe, for I want them. My desire is that your Honour and Councill will be pleased to send mee the rates and prizes of the disposall of the Company's goods in this place, that soe I may follow order, also if I shall give the Company creditt for the goods found here per remaynes in my booke or any other persons, the quantity and quallity, for the account is strangely to mee, therefore expect order. Your honour will be pleased to send a booke to keep my accounts in, some wax and paper. I desire your Honour to be pleased to lett mee have for a time James Mills, I being not able to come downe staires for lameness in my foot, and Mr Pley not yet well, have noe body to looke after the Companys concernes. Pray do not faile to give Ahenesa a gift, to be understood firelocks and spirrits, alsoe send some good powder and bright musketts. Ahenesa desires the same, in soe doeing wee may procure a traid and to hinder our neighbours. Now is the time according to my small oppinion. At the months end shall give my accounts, soe haveing noe more att present onely referr the remainder to Captain Phipps.

Nota
August 21st 1681
Wee sent up to Ahenesa Ba: Conton a black with these following orders:
1st to desire Ahenesa to send his sonn Bobie or any other to know his demands
against Mr Wendover as soone as possible hee could.
2ndly That whome Ahenesa should send to our fort should goe free back againe.
28th ditto
Ahenesa sent to us 3 of his men with a message that the person wee sent to him the 21st was there safely arrived, but would not send his sonn Bobie or any other person to make a pallavora with us before wee tooke our oath upon the Bible and James Mills [took his oath on] their fittish that whome Ahenesa should send, should by us goe free back againe, where uppon Captain George Phipps and I tooke our oath upon the Bible, and James Mills their fettish, as aforesaid, all to regaine the creditt of the Royall Affrican Company, which is abominabley abused, and to procure a trade againe if itt be possible.
The 3 persons Ahenesa sent down to us tould us he designed noe harme against us, onely demanded his owne, of which at present wee are unsensible, and besides bid us beware of the Dutch, for they were all rogues and lyers.
September the 2nd
Ahenesas sonn Bobie came hither and made his palavora with us to say as followeth:
That Ahenesa hath noe demands against Mr Wendover for lying with Boque his wife, neither did hee take any great notice of itt when wee tould his sonn Bobie of itt, onely ditto Bobie tould us his father Ahenesa demanded his due to him one [= on] his monthly sallery, and that the Company, Mr Wendover or any in the Company service should [n]ever be troubled in the least about his wife Boque. To all this Ahenesas sonn Bobie tooke the fetish, and that hee would bring downe a trade, and wee to procure the same tooke the fetish that Ahenesas son or any hee sent to our fort should by us have and receive all civilllity whatsoever.
September the 3rd
Ahenesas sonn Bobie went away, with whome wee sent the aforesaid Black named Ba: Conto with our orders to give Ahenesa an account of our proceedings and what fetish his sonn Bobie hath taken in his behalfe, and that also wee desired ditto Ahenesa to confirm the same.
September the 9th
The aforesaid Ba: Conto returned from Ahenesa with 3 of his men whome sent us worde hee had not the least pretention either against Mr Wendover or any in this fort, and that hee approved of the fetish his sonn Bobie had taken in his behalfe and promised allwayes to confirm the same, and that hee had not nor never would have the least quarrell against the English here, and whatever stories wee heard from the Dutch, blacks or any other wee should not beleive them. Hee did assure us that if wee would procure him good bright musketts, powder and other goods, wee should not want either for slaves, or gold, but wee should have a constant trade. All these aforesaid is the certaine truth to us related in James fort att Accra the 9th September in Guiney 1681.

Note
Mr Frankland and the Portuguese Governour Julian Campo de Barreto bought in company out of an interloper named the Blessing, Mr Edlin and Mr Harvey [commanding], about 200 iron barrs, whereof 60 found here since my last belonging to ditto Frankland. Besides I doe not reckon the muskets which ditto Frankland brought ashoare in Mr Wendovers time, and there is also reported that here is more goods at the Portuguese fort: to whome they belong I doe not know. I am very well satisfied that Mr Arthur Wendover bought some time agoe out of a Dutch ship some sayes, perpettuanoes, fine sletias and other goods, whereof at present is in the Portuguese forte 46 fine sletias, 5 sayes, and 7 perpetuanoes in the hands of Julian Campo de Baretto, which aforesaid goods your honour will be pleased to demand of Mr Wendover as belonging to Mr Frankland, and lett him give his note for the delivering of the same to ditto Julian Campo Barreto, that I may demand the same, alsoe give mee your order for whose account I shall dispose of them.

The Capisheers in generall declared upon their fetish that they would sooner die every man than admitt Mr Hassell to come on shoare, but would with their musketts with their whole force resist him to the utmost, and that if he did come on shoare, the fort should be forever in danger of treachery and never 1 oz[?] of trade should be admitted, for they all declared they loved Mr Nightingalle and would venture their lives for him and bring him a good trade, but as for Mr Hassell they had not forgott their wives, children and friends that was carried away in his time, and that hee should never have one months peace here. I doe assure your worshipp from the bottom of my heart I doe not write this out of any feare from, or persuasions of Mr Nightingalle but purely out of duty and commands your worshipp hath been pleased to give mee to inform you of all transactions of moment, and leave itt to your worshipps pleasure, not doubting but you will please to confide in my fidellity both in this and my former letter (being not without sufficient witness in both), for I thank God I never did, and will imbrace the maxime that honesty is the best pollicy, and doubt not after your worshpp hath been pleased to putt mee right in the abuses put upon me per Mr Frankland as to the pottkeys etc. you shall find your favours not plact amiss, paying humble thanks I ought, for here I live here without expence in the least at the chiefs table, which most heartyly from the bottom of my soule thank your worshipp for, since I could not doe itt att Capo Corsoe. And I most earnestly (on that consideration) begg your worshipp to continue mee here, and if I in the least doe amiss either to the Royall Company or your worshipp I doe not desire the least favour as unworthy of soe much goodness.
I doe not put the Company to the charge of this canoe, for the Cabosheers send it with one of them in it to make a pallavre with your worshipp concerning the promises. I begg your worshipp not to take this amiss, being done out of pure duty (being their very words), and not for any other end.

I am now sensible there was treachery used by those that ought to have done otherwise in that respect.

I have been much aflicted with a relapse of my feavour since my last to your Worship but now I hope all is over.
[PS] By reason of my great sickness under which I lay and am yett troubled with, I had never the key of, nor did deliver any thing out of the warehouse, but James Mills in his time [did so?].

415,1,415,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,18/10/1681,Fort,RAC,"These comes per Mr Wendover, who had come up sooner could hee have gott a canoe. These serve onely to advise your Honour of what wee want here and are in great want of, vizt a hogshead of tarres for the tanke and 1000 bricks to lay the bottom of ditto, 3 or 4 good locks, 1 good large lock for the warehouse dore, some large and short irons for slaves, for wee have none here, I bought 3 men and 3 women yesterday and am afraid of them running away for wont of irons to put them in; and if your Honour can spare some of your elme pipes for to repaire two flankers which are falling, with a mason to repaire them, also some good corne, for that we had per Captain Rickard being but 17 chests are all soe bad that the slaves will not eate it nor scarce the hoggs; also some brandy, for I found not a drop in the forte but a little I brought with me, which is allready expended. I thought good to advise your Honour that soe you might not blame me for not giving timely advise, but that crime shall not be laid to my charge, for per every oppertunity I will advise of affaires here."
416,1,416,William Pley,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,22/10/1681,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships kind letter I have received, for which I returne my most hearty thankes, it being a great cordiall in my trouble for my fathers death, and I shall ever pray for your life, health, and happiness since my well being here wholly depends on your generosity and goodness, which I hope I shall never misuse. As to Mr Hassells opposition [= opposition to Mr Hassell] at landing, when I writ your Worship, the palavor of the Cabbisheeers (which was the same day), God knowes I know nothing of any intrigue, but since tis too apparent twas contrived by James Mills, doubtless by the command of his then Master, as the confession of some of the Blackes and other circumstances make apparent, but I hope all will prove insignificant and wee shall have a good trade (if I may measure the future by the present) to our masters profitt.
[PS] Desire your Worship not to declare (if possible) my words to Mr Nightingale for I am very loath in my condition to create myselfe the least enemy, though what I write is soe true that Mr Nightingale did protest he would not admitt Mr Hassell on shoare before he send his orders in a canoe, to what end I leave your Worship to judge."
417,1,417,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,25/10/1681,Fort,RAC,"Since the above dated I received your honours of the 18th instant, and render your Honour the choycest of tenn thousand thankes for your cordiall expressions to me and I have donn what in me lyeth to render ample sattisfaction to your honours demands, and I will not add fuell to fire, for whome you guess is the whole agitator and whome your Honour has soe highly advanced, Mr Nightingale per name, did say to Mr Pley I should not come on shoar till I had sent him my orders, and upon that gave your honour for all your civilities many bitter curses, for what reason I know not. He would not give me any acccount of every particular mans concerns but said all are the Companyes, which Mr Wendover can give your Honour ample sattisfaction therein. I question not but he has been the hearauld of his owne actions and has sufficiently emblazoned his heroick deeds, thinking noe man able to agitate as he hath donn; but my halfe of this month will demonstrate I have past him, for I have nigh 12m of gold and 12 slaves, and what goods that are vendable for the purchasing more which I will here insert. As for the worthy gentleman Mr Mills, who did before my arrivall upon somewhat of a word given him per Mr Pley, waite for him on purpose to shoote him with 4 bulletts in his peece, and swore if he came downe would be his death.
What I have desired your Honour on the other side I humble begg you will send, for I cannot buy any more slaves till I have corne. I need not mencion what goods, but must submitt and say what you please to spare. I have not a good say nor perpettuanoe, nor sheet, sletia, brandy. Allejars are much in quest for slaves, soe is all goods. This is the needfull at present, with all the paper inke and wax I have [sic], soe hope a speedy supply. I humble begg your Honours favour with the continuance thereof, and I shall assuredly follow your commands in all things without the least breath."
418,1,418,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,31/10/1681,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 27th instant have before me, and in answer to your command of a former date have in every poynt hope rendred your Honour ample satisfaction, which I hope ere this has arrived you in salvo with Mr Wendover, who would have followed Mr Nightingale as I in my former advised but noe oppertunity proffered till that he imbraced per vio Anamaboe, and for want of a 2 hand canoe with 2 canoemen severall things may accidentally happen which requireth speedy advice, soe humbley begg that your Honour will agree for one and send downe at soe much per mensem as you thinke convenient, which will be cheaper then to send up a 5 hand canoe and thinke wee are beholden to them for the pay and laboure. The goods wee had that was good is most gone, soe humbley begg a speedy supply, vizt good sayes, and perpettuanoes, sheets, allejars, sletias, broad niccanees and tapseeles, and any goods, for slaves is to be had if I had these goods. As for necessaryes, corne is most wanting, 10 or 12 pipes of elmes if can be spared to build 3 flankers, which cannot be made use of for want of repaire, a 1000 of good well burnt bricks for to lay the bottom of the tank, with a hogshead of tarras and a bricklayer with a kill of shells to make lime, for the tower is very leaky. If your Honour please to send these things, the charges elce will be little or nothing.
I have in this 25 dayes taken 12m 3o 8 odd mony, and bought 5 men and 6 woemen, and have turnd severall away for want of allejares and other goods above recited.
Immediatly on perusall of your Honours last I gott 2 fresh canoemen and sent them to Mr Shears, whose answere I have here inclosed.
I hope will excuse me of neglect and cleare mee of what was not guilty.
[PS] Mr Pley presents his humble service to your Honour. Here is no brandy nor corne, this I humbley offer to your Honour in hopes of a speedy supply, with paper inke and wax."
419,1,419,William Pley,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,12/11/1681,Fort,RAC,"Since my last to your Worship noe occurrances have happened here worth your perusall, as soon as any presents you shall not want the knowledge of them. My accompt of goods sold in the month of October and remaining the beginning of the next month is ready, most of which are damnified, and unfitt for sale, and wee waite your Worships pleasure as to a supply. I most humbley begg your Worship will please to give me some directions, as to the method of my particular accompt here, whether to send the delivery and remaines of the goods up, or whether my books (agreeing with Mr Hassells noates) will be sufficient for my discharge (if please God I live to see England) to the Royall Company, which obligacon (with those many past) will for ever give me sufficient cause to remaine your Worships most obliged and obedient servant."
420,1,420,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,17/11/1681,Fort,RAC,"These at the request of the bearer I present your Honour with, having been severall times solicited thereto per severall of the blacks here. His request to your Honour is that you would please to see him in some manner righted, for Captain How an interloper hath paniard 3 Cabbisheers at Alampa, one is his brother, who [i.e. How] is now gone to windward. I doubt it will much prejudice our trade at that place, for slaves are very plenty there, and this man hath brought some to me which I have bought, he is a considerable dealer and hath sold many slaves formerly to Captain Leo[?] Woodfine. This he tells me is his only supplycation to your Honour. I am at a stand for want of good goods of all sorts, as advised in my two formers, one by Mr Wendover and the other per the canoe your Honour sent downe, of which I have not a word of the receipt thereof. Heer is slaves if I had goods as advised. Have nothing of news worth citeing."
421,1,421,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,27/11/1681,Fort,RAC,"Yours dated the 23rd instant received yesterday and then would have answered thereto, but could not procure a canoe and was loath to send the 5 hand canoe per reason of to great a charge, for I am loath to pay any more then what I am constrayned to doe. I perceive per your Honours letter that you are much incenced against me, per some buissey body who would be thought officious to gaine creditt for former errors hath been tampering with your Honour to doe me a prejudice per a damnable falce and erronius information. I here invoke God to wittness I did not buy anything of Captain How, but of Captain Rickard I bought a few small blankquitts, not considerable to the number you make mencon of, which I now protest in the presence of God I never made one ounce of, but have given them for dashes, and should I in the past abuse your Honours favour, which heither to hath been soe many towards me that I had need live an age to studdy gratitude, neither doe I know that they were ever accompted the Company's commodities, if I had I would not have medled with them, and should your Honour give creditt to all such stories that may be presented under the colour of fidelity to our Royall Masters interest your hands would have noe cessation from continuall perplexity. I doe now in the presence of the heavenly host and Jihovah protest that He not medle with or deale or none for me in my behalfe for one penny or any other summ with any interloper, and this I humbley offer to your Honours in hopes you will for the future have a more favourable construction of my intended cincerity, which are bona fide for my Royall masters interest, and in the end I hope it may be said of me fines coronat opus."
422,1,422,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,12/12/1681,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 9th of November per Captain Giles Lawrance I have before mee ordering mee to afford my uttmost endeavour to purchase slaves, which I did but wanted goods to purchase them, alsoe to deliver him one moyetie of what I had of each sex, which I did divide in equall parts and cast lotts for him and Captain Woodfine, and haveing noe more then 6 men the halfe being 3, hee would not take any more then 3 woemen, for which I have taken four receipts and have herein inclosed three.
I have been long without a letter from your honour, which was the occasion of my silence. The 5 hand canoe with Captain Quow and Humphrey Davis arrived here on Satureday, bringing with them James Mills and Captain Lawrances boy, and within an houre after [I] sent your honours letter to Captain Lawrance to Mingo, who departed hence on Thursday last early in the morning, and yesterday his boate arrived and today have taken the aforementioned gentlemen and is gone downe. Captain Lawrance in a letter to mee, desires his service to be presented to your honour. This morning the Arda canoe arrived here and brings news of Thomas Gouldings death within 17 dayes after his arrivall, and alsoe Captain Rickards dispatch from thence, and that Captain Wyborne has settled a factory at Whiddah.
I have here also inclosed sent Octobers and Novembers accounts to the 5th instant, whereby your honour will find due to my Royall masters 11m 3oz 9a lta and what slaves remaynes, onely what is aboard Captain Lawrance to be deducted and is not in those accounts because delivered the 8th instant. I humbly begg your honour to peruse what I formerly writt for both for necessaries and goods."
423,1,423,Ralph Hassell/William Pley,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,23/01/1682,Fort,RAC,"These are only and cheifly to supplycate you to give me a line of advice, for itt is long since have received one from you, which makes mee conjecture you are unmindfull of us here or at leastwise have us in great disrespect, for by Captain Woodfine had not a line directory for our proceedings, only an order to deliver him what slaves wee had ready and to take receipts for the same, which hee denied, only giveing one for 7 woemen and 6 men which I have here Inclosed sent your honour, takeing a coppy thereof under test for my security. Captain Woodfine stayed here not above 8 hours. Mr Wendover, his factor and mate came about an houre before the ship and carried the slaves in a 5 hand canoe. Mr Wendover informed mee hee had sworne against mee about a parcell of blanketts that came from on board Captain How, which hee said in the presence of the major part of the fort that you forced him to doe itt, else hee had not gon for Whiddah. If your honour require
test of his word itt shall be at your service. I can produce evidence he never had come from England but for being sued to an outlawrie for perjury (my test is Mr Kirkam Junior in London), and I have in presence heard him objure both father and mother, and if such criminall oaths may be admitted I lay my hand on my mouth and with an humble silence submitt to your honours grave censure, and since per Captain Shears and Charles Towgood understand that your honours sent letters by him for mee which both Mr Pley and myselfe will aver I never received, although asked him for them, which how ill your honours may resent my silence, imputing it to neglect, I know not. I have inclosed sent an account of Decembers sales, which finding right please to noate in conformitie. I received from Captain Shears 20 sayes, and 20 red perpettunaoes, 66 chests corne, 1040 bricks. Musketts if your honours please to send that are good and bright, I can sell 500 in a month as I am promised, and all other goods will vend, powder excepted, for they have been glutted with that formerly. Ahenesa is now in battalia with his army marching towards the Achims. If hee overcomes we may expect slaves, if [he is] over com a better trade for gold then hath been many years, and how to hope for success on either side is dubious, for if overcome these [Accra] people will never be in subjection as now they are, but will increase dayly more and more and old grudges will not be forgott. I requested your honour to send brandy, tarris, trees and other necessaries for rebuilding and finishing the tank, with wax, ink and paper, being now wholy destitute of either I must perforce hereafter continue silent unless supply'd. I humbly begg your honours favourable construction of all within mentioned, being nothing but verity, and with a full resolution to continue in my Roy all Masters interest and advance itt as far as possible in mee lyes and with an unfeined resolution to serve your honour as your commands shall direct, being constant in my performances."
424,1,424,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,01/02/1682,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships letter of the 29th January I received, wherein as I find you are pleased soe far to creditt my former letter as to demand my atestation of Mr Wendovers words, soe I have here enclosed it with 4 wittnesses. And I assure your Worship I esteem it a very great favour that you were soe kind as to send a coppie of Mr Wendovers letter etc. and I hope my future actions will approve me what I profess as honesty and justice to the Royall Company.
Mr Shears delivered here 20 sayes and 20 red pepettuanoes, corne and bricks, for which Mr Shears hath creditt. The corne out of Captain Rickard amounted to noe more then I wrote your Worship. What slaves possible I can (now, or at Ahenesas returne) will purchase for my Royall Masters interest.
PS. All what things did appertaine to Mr Wendover which formerly have renderd an account are here, with increase of his cattle, and when you please to demand them shall be punctually according to command renderd to your Honour.
What musquetts wee have here are all out of order, elce could have vended them ere this time, hope a supply of 500 from your Honour, which vends now and nothing elce for slaves."
425,1,425,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,23/02/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 11th instant per the Cabo Corso Briganteen, Mr Towgood Commander, have received, with 200 musquetts, 200 paper brawles, 40 sayes, 25 perpettuanoes, 100 herba longees, 50 Guinea stuffs and 30 blanketts, which I will use my utmost endeavor to dispose of for my Royall masters interest for slaves and gold, as your Honour directs.
Att present all manner of trade is soe dead that at all the forts here has not this two months taken 4 ounces. The reason is Ahenesa hath been out against the Arcanies and Akims, soe not any traders from any parts dare adventure to come downe, but this day news came that he had taken the Taffo country with some few slaves, the major part of the people fled for succour to the Akims. This day 3 slaves was brought, 2 woemen and 1 man, but I bought them not by reason to great a price, which was 9 musquetts apeece, which in my apprehension is extravigant rates for my Masters proffitt. If Ahenesa is conquered this will certainly be a place of good and considerable trade, if not he will suffer noe Arcanie nor Akim to buy any thing here but what comes through his hands, which he makes double proffitt off, soe expect what the events will be and in the meane time hope for the best. [I] shall also follow your Honours order in demanding satisfaction of Ahenesa for the 100 musquetts.32 Also inquired of the soulders here what man had the 50 musquetts, and the Gunner Thomas Barrett inform'd me it was Quobing, and that he delivered them himselfe, which shall likewise be demanded. I have paid him noe rent since I came nor has not been paid for severall months before except 1 benda per Mr Nightingale.
In your Honours you are pleased to charge me with extravigant expences at Christmas. It hath allwayes been acustomary to give more then what I charge in my account, and whosoever lived here will informe your Honour, and Mr Pley can verrifye the account in that respect and more then what I charge, soe begg your candor therein.
Your Honour writes and has likewise sent downe Humphrey Davis to be my assistant, but in what capacity I cannot imagine he is able to assist me as Mr Pley hath done, for I dare not trust him as a second to keep the key of the warehouse by reason he had not given any security as Mr Pley hath, in whose fidelity and ability I could confid, and [he] always delivered every months account just to mee according to noeates given him, and your Honour does me a great diskindness in bereaveing me of his good company. I leave all the relation of affaires to his information. I have found all goods right that has bee under his management which has been all here, but this month I found a musquett under one of the Arda's bedds, and whipt him severely for it. He confest his crime and likewise charged a free black, Ashuma one of the black souldiers, to have been in confederacy with him in stealing 9 more, which he mistrusting run away the day before, but if I can catch him I will send him away on the Company account, also 6 barrs of iron which is now wanting and 1 blew narrow baft which he threw over the wall when he went to turne them as they were drying, which wee here doe by reason of a damp warehouse every month. I have paid Mr Pley his sallery due, which was 2 months, vizt to the 1st of March. I humbley begg your Honour, if you please to grant it that I am per your Honour continued here, to send Mr Pley back againe as soone as possible, for Humphrey Davis is noe wayes capacitated to aid me, unless your Honour and worthy Gentlemen of Council please to order mee to deliver him the key of the warehouse and that I may be cleare from all things that shall bee wanting when you shall please to require an account of me. I dispatcht Captain Towgood in less then 24 houres and have supply'd all his wants for the furthering his voyage, as wood 2 5 hand canoe fulls, water and [sic =an] iron bound caske a tunn, and for himselfe dishes, basons, kettles, plates and spoones and all things towards housekeeping
Your Honours per Monsieur Barboate I received but had not oppertunity to answer, and in obedience to your Commands I treated him with all the civillity I could, and [as] for the pacquett he gave me none, but he is gone windward in the sloope and suppose he may have sent what he promised as said he would. The French have great hopes to have bought the fort of the Portuguese but they obteyn'd not their desire. I heare of noe place that they are minded to settle nearer then Alampo, which they tould me, that is Monsieur Penell and Monsieur Robellene, more ships were comeing and the new French Company did intend on there, which your Honour may hinder per presettlement and give somewhat of a dashey, elce afterwards wee must expect noe slaves thence. Mingo is the best place, for there is both gold, and the best in Guinea, and slaves, it is not above 2 leagues from Alampo, and if your Honour approves of the designe I will make inquiry therein, and imagine itt more feasable then Tanton Querry and of more considerable trade per 10 to 1, soe expect your resolve per next and leave it to Mr Shears and Charles Towgoods
relation. I have inclosed my January account, in which you may perceive that there is small trade at present, and the reasons hereof I have before recited.
Charles Towgood tould me you desired a couple of good breading goates which I have of Mr Wendover's and are good, and now have sent your Honour and hope that they will answer what they have done here, for they were good here never bringing less then 3 and 4 apeice and now they are above halfe gone with young. Mr Pley had gone last night had not bad weather prevented him, soe hope your Honour will not chyde him in that point. I have not more at present to inlarge, having in all matters renderd your Honour a perticular account, but this only that when you are supplyed with sheets and sletias you will please to send some downe, being most inquired for here.
[PS] I have paid the 5 hand canoemen 3 dayes canky mony."
426,1,426,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,12/03/1682,Fort,RAC,"These I humbly present to your Honour with all for covert of Charles Towgoods letters [sic], the contents whereof I know not of what validity it may concerne my Royall masters interest. This is the first oppertunity I could imbrace by reason of a tempestuous sea which has broake all the canoes att Accra, not one either great or small has escap'd, the Companys 5 hand canoe in the night alsoe although haul'd above 6 foot above high water. This is a windward canoe that brought corne which I have seized on purpose to dispatch Charles letters, and hope your Honour will send her back with all expedition. I have also inclosed my February accounts, which indeed irketh mee to send per reason of soe inconsiderable incomes and soe great expences, which in noe way immaginable could be avoided, which if your honour pleases to cast your eye on will find nothing extravigantly charged, soe hope you'l not think mee culpable. Yett nevertheless though att present small trade is, I live in hopes better will come to make amends for the bad, soe that interlaceing the good with the bad it will in the end ballance expectations. I could have sold the musketts for gold but will not unless I have halfe gold, halfe slaves."
427,1,427,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,18/03/1682,Fort,RAC,"Your Honours of the 13th and 15th instant is before mee. In the first your orders shall be punctually observed, and in the latter you please to express that the Companys stock is wasted per expences and that some other way must be found to increase a trade, alsoe why I made noe prevention to save the canoe, to all which I with humble submission desire to answer with your Honours permission. Imprimis, I am certaine that noe one here hath been more desireous to gaine your Honours
favour and my Royall masters good will per saveing of them money and not to be extravigant of others bulces which are soe far above mee which with a word may command all that I have from mee, and likewise I have never charg'd any thing extravigant in any of my accompts. Secondly, for a speedier way of finding an increase of trade, I have studied and ponderd on all immaginable meanes but nothing will be of a trade till the warrs are over, that the wayes may be free for up countrys to come downe, which I conjecture your Honour is sufficiently sencible thereof, which if you please to aske any black that can informe you of the same. Thirdly, for prevention of the canoes being broake, had I knowne that the flood would have come in the night I myselfe with all the helpe I could gett would have prevented itt, but this I humbly offer to your honour, shee was haul'd up as high as ever any canoe was yett att Accra, but soe high a flood I never yet knew. Your Honours to Charles Towgood inclosed Jamque[?] of the 13th date I sent immediatly away to him. These canoemen would not goe to Allampo, soe [I] was forced to take their canoe and hyre two others which I have paid, and suppose here is answer thereto inclosed, and by reason of your honours order to dispatch your last to him I have sent another canoe this morning to him."
428,1,428,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,25/03/1682,Fort,RAC,"Your honours of the 21st instant have received (with one inclosed to Mr Charles Towgood) and marke well the contents and shall follow your honours directions therein. Have now likewise inclosed two of Mr Charles Towgoods. Att present have nothing of news, only yesterday a few Anguinah men came downe and laid out above 10 ounces in sayes and brawles and Guynea stuffs. I alsoe sent a small dashey to the Queene of Anguinah per one Cabusheere of our towne, whoe has promised to bring trade. I desire your honour to send for some of the hogs that are here, for without a great deale of corne I cannot maintaine them, they increase soe fast. Yesterday 5 sows piged 30 and with what formerly that I have weaned and bred young and old there is upwards of three score besides 3 sows more to pigg, which stock if maintained would be a verry considerable income but with great charge here. I have destroyed none but have been verry carefull in preserving them."
429,1,429,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,03/04/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 28th and 29th last past I received, the first instant ordering mee to put what gold I had in cash of my Royall masters the Affrican Company of England on board Mr Towgood, which I have obeyed and likewise what good slaves shall be in the fort. The gold is the ballance of February's account, which if you will please to cast your eye on said account you'l find to be 12 marks, 4 ounces, 1 angle and 7
taccoes as per coppy of his receipt here inclosed, also 6 woemen slaves on board the Cape Coast Briganteen, Charles Towgood Commander. Mr Towgood hath had a brass kettle for the use of said briganteen. I pray your honour to send some more corne, for wee shall not have enough to last longer then this month. What slaves else remains are bad and have been severall times refused per the Companys ships, soe would not send any that are bad."
430,1,430,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,03/04/1682,Fort,RAC,"I have wrote your honour per Charles Towgood, Commander of the Cape Coast Briganteen, of this same date, wherein I gave your honour an account I had in persuance to your commands shipt on board the said briganteen 12 marks, 4 ounces, 1 angle and 7 taccoes of gold, with 6 good woemen slaves as per his receipt herein inclosed, which finding right please to noate in conformity, to which I humbley refer you. I humbly begg pardon for my brevity."
431,1,431,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,22/04/1682,Fort,RAC,"It is now full 2 months since I have had the happyness to receive a line from your honour, which indeed is the occasion of my silence. I am dubious all things with your honour hath not been according to your expectations, and the verity is yesterday the bad news of your honours sickness arrived per a Black that came from your parts, which informed mee per word of mouth that you had been soe for some time, which did not a little amaze mee and is the sole occasion of this and I humbly crave a word of advice of your health, for which I heartyly beg God of his infinitt mercy to restore you to your former health. This alsoe accompanys my last 2 months accounts, which should not have been soe long lacking had any oppertunity presented before this. Yesterday I bought 6 as good slaves as any I have seen in Guyney, vizt 4 men 2 woemen. Ahenesa hath taken Coma country, and his partner Ancroffe hath routed all the people from Ningo to the River of Volta and all the Allampas are fled to a place about 4 leages leward of the River Volta to a place called Quitto, att which place I beleeve there is good tradeing, and verry speedily the Allampas will returne againe. Had I a parcell of good sletias they would vend for 10a a peece and sheets for 24 per bendy. I have sold but 2 green perpettuanoes this month for 14a each, with some other small things, nothing but sletias and sheets are in request. Here is one Benjamin Houlding, a souldier that left 2 angles per month in England
for three years, which time is expired and beggs your honour to consider him in the 2 angles per month, that hee may be paid here. I have formerly wrote for some brandy but have not as yett been supplyed, alsoe for some corne. I bought yesterday 6 chests for 2a per chest, or else I could not buy any slaves; it is very scarce here. I humbly begg your honour if the ship be arriv'd with timber you will please to spare some for this place, being in great want, will send the dementions per next after I heare of the arrivall."
432,1,432,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,01/06/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 17th last past yesterday arrived my hands, wherein you are pleased to tax mee with negligence in long silence, per which I perceive you had not received mine of the 21 past, in which I hope you'l be convinced that I was no wayes blameable. This I hope will arrive your honour in salvo per the hands of Mr Smith, whoe hath undergone lately a great deale of damage and hazard, but hope hee hath past the worst being now soe neare home. I know not what weather you have had att Capo Corsoe, for since my last wee have not had 24 hours of faire weather, which hath done us much damage, for almost all the out works is falen or ready to fall, which Mr Smith hath viewed and hope your honour if you have any spare timber to send some downe or order for the provideing, for wee are much necessitated here for timber and lime. This with Mr Smiths full relacons I hope of things in that respect will be sufficient. Mr Charles Towgoods vessell sprung a very great leake here, soe that I fear'd shee would founder, but I did my endeavour to prevent all damage and aided him with all assistance in sending 6 lusty men slaves to pump her, but now I hope shee will doe well, being gon downe to Tishen about 4 leages off to borrow some helpe of the carpenter of another ship which is promised him. I tooke noe goods out of him as yett, haveing noe occasion att present for such goods as hee could spare."
433,1,433,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,25/06/1682,Fort,RAC,"These serves for covert to the two inclosed from Captain Starland and from Mr Towgood, which last night late I received included in one from boath of them desireing mee to hasten them with all immaginable expedition, which I have done, not knowing the contents thereof but what Mr Towgood in his informed mee hee had sprung another dangerous new leake. Your honour in your last informed mee that Captain Shears would be ready to saile in 2 day's but as yett not arrived with any provisions towards erecting or supplying our buildings, which I have already begun and shall want good timber for all the 4 flankers, which 16 pieces 24 foot long will serve, if 23 foote some small baulks and boards with nailes, lyme to
plaister all the works; these provided the fort will be better and stronger then ever yett with a very small charge, for I have now 3 maisons att work and a carpenter which I borrow from the Dutchman.
I have now upwards of 50 slaves in the forte, which eats a chest of corne every day and I cannot gett any for money here. I have once sent my 7 hand canoe to Barracoe for corne and itt costs with charges 3a a chest, which formerly I bought for 2 here. This day I paid 2 paper brails for 2 chests. And slaves comes in very plenty and I not haveing provisions to supply them, I must send my canoe to windward this night for more corne. They are somewhat deare in their slaves as yett, but the Portugueze nor Dutch buy's none soe I will lower them as much as possible I can. I give now not above 6 pezos 1 for men as your honour has rated goods, and question not but to have itt lower then 6 pezos for men and soe accordingly for woemen, but He not buy any but choyce slaves as hitherto have done. I have not now by mee 8 peeces of good sayes and all the green and blew perpettuanos are gone, and Guyney clouts, soe pray a supply of those goods and them that are good and all in cases or chests, for all the goods before the last parcell were without any, soe that here are very few good goods (though great quantity) but what are damag'd and of small validity. Itt is thought nay said that Ahenesa will speedily be att home with considerable quantities of slaves and gold which will be brought here, soe shall advise your honour as occasion serves. Mr Wendovers hoggs has come to great mortallity, for within this month of great raines there has dyed 15 breeding sowes, shoats, and 2 very large boars, besides piggs and most of the sowes with pigg, all well over night and dead in the morning. I wrote your honour for a butt of brandy but as yett Captain Shears is not come, which wee now much want. I have bought att great rates this 2 months out of the Dutchman and cannot be supplyed now; our people humbly beggs your honour to supply them these fogg times, for two are now sick. I had almost forgott to intreate your honour that above all things to send downe 10 paire of strong irons and 20 or 30 paire of short irons, for this day I have borrowed of the Dutchman, and some paper, for I teare my books for this, some iron wedges and a maule to cleave rock's."
434,1,434,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,05/08/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 2nd instant I have received, and your honour indeed may wonder att my silence, which indeed hath been occasioned by sickness and alsoe per a sting of scorpion on my right hand, which I could not till this day hold a penn in my hand, else had not been negligent in performing my duty. I have received from on board the Affrican Merchant, Captain Samuell Starland Commander, 25 perpettuanoes, 50 iron barrs and 50 Guiney stuffs, and likewise have received from on board the
Cape Coast Briganteen 25 perpettuanoes, 20 sayes and 48 tapsells, and sayes will be wanting in a short time. I am extreamly troubled to informe your honour that on the 26th of July wee lost 13 men and 1 woeman which gott out of prison in the night, although a centry stood att the doore. They undermined the prison walls and gott out, which was the strongest place in all our forte. I shewed the place to Mr Starland and Mr Towgood whoe will render your Honour an account thereof. I have used my uttmost endeavour ever since and have sent to all parts and as yett cannot have any intelligence, which is a dayly and nightly perplexity to mee. I have gott up two flankers as high as the paveing and shall goe forwards with all vigour. Ahenesa will (as is reported) returne to Quomboe the next weeke and then may expect a supply of slaves. For upwards of 5 weeks here has been 3 or 4 interlopers which has given upwards of a bendy a head for slaves, soe that could not gett any. I have now putt on board 33 slaves [in] the Cape Coast Briganteen vizt 12 men, 20 woemen and 1 boy. I have now sent May and Junes account, and tomorrow or next day another Capo Corsoe Canoe will goe hence and then shall send July's account, this being the last day. If wind and weather permitts the vessell will saile hence to Cape Corsoe. The irons, maule and wedges were lost, the canoe being kickadevood and staved, soe shall want those necessaries. This is all that offers att present, intending to write two dayes hence of all other things that shall in the interim present."
435,1,435,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,09/08/1682,Fort,RAC,"I wrote your honour of what you desired in yours of the 2nd instant, which beleeve may be with you ere this. Likewise of the loss of the slaves, which I have ever since endeavoured to regaine. I humbly begg your honour not to impute itt any wayes to my negligence, for I will in verryty certifie your honour that duely and truely a good watch both of whites and blacks is kept every night, and for the future if any slaves breaks through the prison I now have built I will be responsable for. Itt is 4 foot thick and 3 foot in foundation deepe. Captain Starland and Mr Towgood is now in the road windbound, they have in all about 100 slaves aboard both their vessells, and I supply their wants both with wood and water. If they stay here any time, I immagine Captain Shears may in a manner be up as soone as they with his loading of slaves per what I understand by a canoe last night from Allampo. Ahenesa will be att home this weeke with great quantity of slaves, and then shall render advice what progress hath made in his atcheivments. Hee hath conquered the Commongs, which was a verry greate people. When hee is att home and [I am] certaine thereof I will either send or goe my selfe if the people will admitt mee. I have here inclosed sent your honour my Jully's accounts as your honour demanded."
436,1,436,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,28/08/1682,Fort,RAC,"These are on purpose to acquaint your Honour that on Fry day last here came downe severall traders from Quomboe and laid out what mony's they had in say's, and have taken all that are good; and amongst the rest Ahenesahs cheife son with 30 or 40 men whoe were sent on purpose to carry mee up to Quamboe to treat with his father about the prizes of slaves and goods, there being verry greate quantity's of slaves there, soe I have sent up one of my boyes to enquire the verrity thereof. Hee likewise desired mee to write for sayes, sletias, course and fine, sheets and halfe barrels of powder, per reason whole barrels are too great a weight to carry soe far in the country, alsoe for currell if any att Cabo Corsoe. These are all that was desired, soe hope your honour will supply mee per Satureday next, att which time I expect the same persons againe, alsoe would desire your advice if convenient for my journey. I am willing to adventure for my masters interest any where, haveing been there formerly and had a kind reception. I have finished one flanker and another the beames are laid, and alsoe am now a breaking of stones to finish itt and soe goe on with what speede possible with the other works. Lyme is the only thing wanting and here is shells enough att the waterside about 5 leagues off to serve our turns if could but gett them here. Mr Shears hath severall times fetcht from thence, soe he knows the place verry well. Also [we need] a couple of good beams about 15 or 16 foot long for the tower, about 9 or 10 inches square. In my last I advised your honour that the wedges, maule and irons were lost, if slaves comes I shall want irons for have not above 10 paire that are good, soe a supply of all these are needfull. I shall from time to time render your honour advice as occasion shall proffer."
437,1,437,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,02/10/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yours I have received saying [you are] admireing you heare not oftener from mee. Itt is now I must acknowledge a month since I wrote you last, which putting my Royall masters to 8a charge, and your honour formerly charg'd mee with extravagant chargeing in my accounts, for that reason I am as provident as I can, and would that I could in any manner save what expended that might be thought surplusage. In your honours last you ordered mee to send up my accounts with the ballance, I have made them up to the 5th instant, and what comes between this and then shall be transported to the next account. The ballance of the last account there is due 10oz 15a and odd tacco's, which I have not sent (for which begg your excuse) by reason that 12 day's hence is pay day and then must pay 11 oz and odd. If trade comes not I know not how men can live, for every thing of provisions is soe excessive deare that scarce a little corne but by the taccoe can be had heare. Most of all our people has been sick; Humphry Davis is now soe weake that I know not whether ever hee may recover. John Fishpoole died the 10th September, hee had of mee 8a before his death for pay, and itt wanted 5 dayes of a month. Hee left nothing but a few old cloaths which hee gave amongst the men to drink att his funerall, which was apprased at 8a.
[PS] I immagine Captain Nurse will saile hence for Cabo Corsoe in 2 or 3 dayes."
438,1,438,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,02/10/1682,Fort,RAC,"Your particular letter per Captain Nurse I received and likewise your generall letter. In your letter your honour admires the hoggs, goates etc. were not sent up. I asked them to doe itt but they refused, haveing noe roome. Alsoe your honour is desireous to heare oftener from hence, which if you please to inspect in former letters you may see that your honour blames mee for too much charge in my accounts, and for that only reason I send noe oftener then you please to order mee, for 8a to carry a letter of noe consequence twice or thrice every month will amount to monys; therefore I humbly begg you not to censure mee negligent. I have now made up my accounts to the 5th instant and have inclosed sent them, per which your honour will see the scarcity of mony and slaves here, which is occasioned by shipps rideing here, for this month has layne one or two ships in sight and this day is a small ship come downe, which will make a bad trade for above this weeke longer here if hee stayes. Captain Nurse will have on board tomorrow if his sloope getts up (as she is in sight) the best part of 300 slaves, as I conjecture by their view. Hee purposes to stay about 2 dayes longer here. I have not as yett put anything aboard him, only 2 men 2 woemen, till the day that hee sailes, which will be 2 dayes hence. Your honour with the Councill ordered mee to send likewise the ballance of my accounts per the canoemen, which if you please to view them you will find to be due 10oz 15a etc. to be due as the 5th instant and on the 14th will be pay day, att which time I must pay 11oz and odd, and if trading continues soe bad and should not have [money] to pay them the men might starve, for everything of provisions is extreame deare here, that itt is not hardly to be gott for mony, and through excessive heate can scarce gett water under 9 miles. Most nay all our men have been sick with one distemper or other. John Fishpoole, a souldier, died the 10th of September and Humphrey Davis is excessive ill, soe that now wee have here, now Christmas Cock works [sic], noe more than 2 that stands centinall of whitemen. This I thought good to informe your honour particularly of, as ikewise I have abreviated to your honour and Councill."
439,1,439,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,16/10/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 12th instant per the hands of Mr William Masters I have received, and understand you are sorry I should have soe small a trade after soe greate encour-agement that I gave your Honour of a trade. In answer to which I humbly begg your favours to heare my reasons (which I doubt not but will in some measure render some small content to satisfaction). Imprimis, Ahenesa after his returne from conquest did desire mee to come up and agree for slaves, which I wrote your Honour and was denyed, and my not goeing there caused severall strangling slaves to a quantity to Tishee, where many ships have gott many slaves and gives greate rates alsoe for gold. Here has not for above 3 months been less then 2 or 3 interlopers which have undersold the Company per much, which blacks will goe 2 or 3 leagues to save 6 tacco's. Alsoe Ahenesa is now in much feare of the Achims coming on him, soe that within this weeke he hath given considerable quantity of gold and all his captivated slaves, soe these reasons pondered may with others for the future give you content. I have according to your commands received Mr Masters with as much allacrity as possible your orders could direct, and on sight did according to orders and have delivered him 7oz 9a 5ta in ballance to this day, which finding right please to note in conformity. I have through neglect (I must confess) omitted 28 halfe firkins of tallow ever since May account, not with any intent of fraud for they are all here and doe not vend. Mr Starland did receive of Humphrey Davis to pay your Honour lo 11a 4ta, for which hee has had noe notice thereof. Hee is now indifferent well and presents his humble service to you. I purpose att the expiration of this month to send Mr Swindall the mony Samuell Stone owes him."
440,1,440,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,17/11/1682,Fort,RAC,"Since my last of the 16th October per Mr Masters have been silent, which was occasioned through [lack of] matter to correspond on, since which Ahenesa sent downe his son with upwards of 60 people desireing mee to come up to Quomboe to see a great quantity of slaves, sending one son as a pawne for my security, which though your Honour before denied yett thinking itt might prove for my Royall masters interest, I trespased on your Honours commands and went: where I had civill reception and am safe return'd, but old matters were there debated betwixt us, imprimis, why hee did not pay the debts due to the Royall Company contracted by Mr Wendover, to which hee made an answer Wendover owed him 25 bendy's for months custom of the forte, and that besides hee had layne with his wife, which he did expect [payment for?] according to the custome of the country. He demanded of mee custom ever since I was here, to which I responded I had not taken soe much money in my time, and itt was agreed hee should be paid on these conditions, that hee with his people should come downe and trade here att this fort only, and that hee should not hinder any other up country people from comeing downe. I tould him likewise that hee had been 10 months out of his country and that I had not seen any of his people, and what reason or with what face could hee demand a bendy a month thus. He answers hee was now return'd and would performe whatever hee had promised, provided hee might be supply'd att this fort with such goods as hee wanted, which I answered as far forth as Cape Coast could supply hee should not want if I saw he fail'd not of his word. Then wee proceeded to prizes of goods and slaves, hee demanded a bendy a head for a man and 6 pezos for a woemen. I tould him I would give itt him provided hee would allow mee my prizes for goods, vizt powder 7 pezos a barrell, 5 pezos for say's, 12a for perpettuano's, 3a for brawls, 3a carpetts, 9a fine sletias, 5a course ditto, and other goods to any amount per rates. If your honour thinks meet of this I begg a word of your advice and a supply of those goods I shall now write for per the verry first oppertunity. I have now in the fort 50 slaves and hope if you send a vessell downe with corne with expedition I shall gett more, I now desist for want of corne. I have sold this weeke to Allampo people 13 or 14 barrells of powder for slaves and itt is verry bad powder, or else might have raised itt to 7 pezos, soe begg a supply of good powder, full barrells and well hoopt. I have now sent up my October accompt the ballance whereof is 1m 70z 3a, which finding all things right please to noate itt in conformity. The charges are much by reason of wood, trees and shells, for when a thing is once done well the proverb is tis twice done, and I would not have the same charge to be againe in my life time. I am now about the other halfe of the tower, being breaking stones etc. I humbly begg a supply of goods and necessary's undermentioned.
A box of white beads, some blew beads according to this patern and some biger, 80 tapsells, 40 good say's, 100 blanketts, 100 sletias fine and course, 20 or 30 barrells of powder full, dry and well hoopt in halves, quarters and wholes, 6 chests of sheets or more, some looking glases if any. All these Ahenesa will buy and desired to have them writt for. I humbly begg your Honour to spare if possible 2 hogsheads of tarris for the tank and halfe a sheet of lead for spouts."
441,1,441,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,16/12/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 22nd last past have now before mee, in which you verry much blame mee for my journey to Quomboe and say itt was not design'd for my masters interest. However itt be your good pleasure to conjecture soe, yett I know itt was [for my masters' interest], for two reasons I will demonstrate. First, as you are all men of reason what pleasure could you immagine I could take in soe unpleasant and tedious journey when itt hath been the death of one factor already, of which I had caution. Secondly, what delight could any man unless a prodigall receive in spending whatever hee had in the company of unknowne people, and such a one I am not, haveing not wherewithall to be lavish of, and likewise I went up to open the way that traiders might come to the forte and that none of his people should goe on board of ships to buy any goods nor any one for them, which I doe verry well know there doth, which in plaine is the mine of all these forts. And as for prizes of slaves the agreement was on this condition, that your Honour would ratifie itt, and since your displeasure therein is knowne He not performe any contract and have bought noe slaves since. I did renew noe old thing about Mr Wendover and his wife, butt [it] being moved to mee thought good to informe you thereof, that I might have further inspection in that affaire. I have by Captain Churchey received his account [of?] debts on this day sennitt. On Monday last I sent a messenger to demand these debts and informe Ahenesah how ill hee hath served the Company in not rendering satisfaction all this time, but as yett I heare noe answer. My meaning by noateing my account in conformity is after examination thereof to make mee debtor to ballance thereof, and when you please to order itt and when your orders shall be obeyed. I find your displeasure greate likewise is extravagant expences. I know not of one angle but what was really expended and paid. I am heartyly sorry I cannot gett better traiding, which I have inform'd your honour above. In the margent you likewise order mee to send up Mr Wendovers goods att Accra. I know of none but houshold stuff, and 3 sowes, 12 piggs, for I never had any accompt from any that succeeded him, and if your Honour knowes what they are pray informe mee and send an oppertunity and they shall be sent up. I wrote your Honour per the last the great necesity wee stand herein for want of corne, yett have had noe supply. I can gett none here. Pray send for the slaves up or elce they will starve. I have here inclosed sent up Novembers accompt. I find errors in the goods sent per Captain Churchey, which please to rectifie. In the case no.447 is mentioned 30 blanketts, which all the men in fort can justifie there is but 25 and many rotton att the edges and much motheaten. Likewise in the case no.251 with chalke, for the black marke cannot be seen, is mentioned 20 good say's, in which case is not one good and I beleeve the case lay halfe up in buldge water or else under the fall of pump water. I open'd only the upper side and lett itt stand in the sun, both the wrapper and matt are rotton. In the chest of white beads no.l67M I have not the contents, nor the prizes of looking glasses that I must sell for, I have ventered to sell 3 at la per piece. Likewise a barrell of tarras instead of a hogshead."
442,1,442,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,26/12/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 19th instant have received and am much grieved, notwithstanding my sinceer (and not pretended) actions, should not prevaile to give you that content which I did hope might have reception. These accompanys Mr John Winder, whoe hath been here 3 dayes ill of a feavour and was by mee desired to stay till hee had received a refreshment after a tedious voyage, and the rogues the canoemen would not be perswaded to stay for him, and other roguish actions which is to tedious to rehearse which [I] leave to his relation; and had they their desert (which I question not but your honours reason will retalliate) whipping is too good for them. Since the receipt of your honours I have examined the letters of the 22nd past, one which was the former mention'd but 25 blankquetts which arrived mee per the canoe on the 24th ditto, but the other per Captain Churchey arriveing mee the 9th instant of same date did mention 30, which I examined by, not noting the former, soe the mistake ly's in mee by not examining the orriginall, which fault pardon, although men ought to examine one with the other, which since I did and finding noe more to be placed to my debt I have torne the letter. I understand that Mr Towgood is now at Barracoe, whome I expect shortly downe and hope to ship what slaves I have on board him. I have not as yett any order for the delivery of them, hope may receive itt per him. This is what att present offers and for trade none presents in these parts to noe forts. I have bought but 1 man slave this month and gold soe inconsiderable I am afraid and ashamed to relate itt. The Dutch now proffers sayes according to their Generalls order loz and other goods farr below what wee can afford."
443,1,443,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,29/12/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 26th instant I received ordering mee to send up Mr Winder etc., which I had performed ere the arrivall of yours. Mr Towgood is now here, and shall according to order take out such goods as have occasion for. Hope ere the arrivall of this you will meete with my former of the 26th instant per the party ordered to be sent up, I haveing given sufficient (and hope) orders to deliver him to Mr Thelwall att Annamaboe. Nothing of trade presents for want of sletias and sheets, which now is the only commodity here, and itt may be as great a drugg in 2 or 3 months hence as itt is now in request."
444,1,444,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,31/12/1682,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 26th instant ordering mee to secure Mr John Winder etc. have answered and hope is well with you. Likewise yours of the 16th ditto per Mr Towgood, of whome I have received 200 iron barrs and 2 chests of sheets for which have given him a receipt. Likewise have sent up by him the ballance of my Novembers accompt which is 3 marks, 4 angles and 4 tacco's, not knowing when I might meet with such an other oppertunity, and as soone as this month is expired my accompts shall not be wanting."
445,1,445,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,08/01/1683,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 3rd instant have received late att night the 6th, in which you say you much admire why I should detayne the Royall Companys canoes, which indeed you may admire if itt were soe, for I did not desire one houre of their stay here more then till next morning till Mr Winders cloaths were washt and dryed, and that they had letters for you I knew nothing thereof. As [for] the canoemen lett Docter Griffin aske the boatswain of the canoe if ever I opened my mouth about any letters or in the least way's offered them mony for the delivery thereof. I call God to wittness I never thought soe much, which I am per Mr Winder informed was said against mee, and that I put 2 of the canoemen in irons is as falce as the other; and to write the playne truth I putt 2 men in irons but they were not belonging to the canoes but passengers that were canoemen to William Parris, and 2 canoemen which belonged to one of the canoes stay'd behind, which went up with Mr Winder in the canoe and saved him 6 angles; and the other 2 were released the day after his departure and did offer to stay here and remaine with mee, but these 10 dayes [I] have not seen them. I wonder Mr Winder could not informe your honour thereof but because hee would have mee beare the blame in that, as hee doth the other in saying I gave him liberty to breake open your letters [which] is as erronious as any thing ever proceeded out of mans mouth: for how should I know that your honour would write mee, I have not the spirritt of devination and I think nay know my selfe not soe voyd of reason as to give that liberty to my father if hee were living, much less to any man thats a stranger to mee; and to salve himselfe thereof, in a letter of the 4th instant [Winder] desires mee not to denie itt, as itt stands to his future welfare or utter mine, which letter I have taken a copie thereof and if you please shall be att your service, but the orriginall shall never be seen to prejudice mee in corresponding in soe base actions. The sloope hath been gon hence this 9 dayes and hope is with you ere this, and pray examine Mr Towgood about that affaire etc. The canoemen are in hast and will not stay, else should inlarge, which will per next which will be per via Annamaboe within this 2 or 3 days. I hope Mr Towgood hath delivered 3m Oo 4a 4ta ballance of Novembers account."
446,1,446,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,14/01/1683,Fort,RAC,"I wrote your Honour in my last that I would inlarge in my next, this being the sequall. Thought might have kist your hand ere this, but the canoe per via Annamaboe past unknowne to mee in the night. I suppose your honour hath heard how Captain Mingham and his Docter parted and the reasons therefore, hee haveing threatned the Captains death by poyson [he] was unwilling to carry him farther for feare his devilish threats might take place, and worke to strongly on such evill minded persons. Hee arrived here and not being well, stay'd 2 dayes and was blooded per Samuell Stone, and some of his men being sick aboard did desire the Captain that hee would speake to mee that Samuell Stone might goe with them in the ship. Hee made severall propositions to him before I knew itt, and [Stone] said if I would give my consent hee would goe, and being earnestly desired per Captain Mingham to lett him goe, I told him I durst not, unless your Honour would order mee. Hee offered mee and has given mee his obligation for 100 sterling to indemnify mee from the Company and your honour, and hope your honour will not think itt ill done since hee is still in the Companys service and may be more beneficiall in that imploy then here. I alsoe had one bendy to pay what he owed Captain Phipps and myselfe etc. and one months pay that was due to him, and if that hee stayed here on[e] hundred years in the capacity hee was in hee would never have paid what he owed, although I gave him his dyett and cloathed him. I suppose your honour has been informed per Mr Towgood how the slaves would have rose upon us, but being prevented all is well. I have, humbley begging your pardon, put on board Captain Branfill the 4 greatest rogues and 4 woemen, and have received in leiw thereof 170 ounces of corrall, which hope will turne to better advance, for itt eats noe corne, which now is deare. And the canoe which went up with Mr Winder received verry much damage, soe that I could not mend her here, soe have sold her to Captain Branfill for 8 sletias, which shall have creditt in this months account and is more then her prime cost. I have hindred all canoes from tradeing with him in this roade, soe that now hee is 3 leagues to leward at Tishee. The Dutchman here paniard some goods that I had sold some Acquomboes, and I have donne the like by him when I caught the goods hee sold, as hee did in my towne, soe pray informe the Dutch Generall if hee gave him such orders, for I conjecture that hee doth itt out of mallice that they bought them here, and He not be wanting to doe as he doth after I heare your answer, neither will I release what I have till hee doth, because hee made the first beginning. This I hope may find your honour with all Gentlemen in prosperous health as itt now leaves mee. Here is now in this road and in this place 4 sayle of ships vizt Captain Branfill and 2 interlopers, whose names I know not but one the blacks tells mee is one Salloway a Dutch interloper, and Thomas Travers whoe arrived here yesterday. I have here inclosed sent my Decembers account, which was forgott in my last, and humbly intreate your honour that Docter Askin may be here in case of accidents, being now noe more then 6 whitemen."
447,1,447,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,07/02/1683,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 20th past per Captain Cope have before mee, which gives mee to understand your displeasure in detaining the Royall Companys canoes that came from Arda neare 3 dayes, to which I object I detained them not one houre longer then they had sufficiently refresht themselves, only desired them to stay, nay would have had them but tarryed till next morning for Mr Winder, but my desire with them was not prevailent enough, soe leave itt to your honours judgement. Likewise you write you much admire parting with Samuell Stone one of the Companys servants to Captain Mingham, to which humbly begging your pardon I reply itt was for these reasons: first, haveing some of his sick people and himselfe not well did upon his earnest entreaty grant him, which I doe immagine your honour would not have denyed him had hee wrote your honour, which to further his voyage could not stay. Next, considering itt was to one of the Companys ships and was for the benefitt thereof, of the voyage, hee may as well be serviceable in that imploy as if here and if hee goes to England will be thought of not the worse by reason of serving in the ship for the Royall Companys benefitt. And as for the slaves which were delivered Captain Branfill (if you impute itt as a crime) itt being the first time, with humble submission beg your pardon and shall for the future be more cautious. I have according to order shipt on board the George and Betty, Captain Cope Commander, 27 slaves which hee himselfe accepted of vizt 10 men, 2 boyes and 15 woemen. What your honour desired about Mr Winders letter itt is enclosed, and as to what goods hee landed here that arrived [in] my sight was some Arda cloaths and 3 remnants of silke of which I bought as much as would make a suite, his cloaths and such not worth your honours notice. I have enclosed likewise sent the 13a due to Captain Phipps's estate from Samuell Stone; alsoe my January's account.
[PS] Only sheets, iron barrs and tapsells are in request: this day have sold 24 tapsells. I am necessitated for a little inke."
448,1,448,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,20/02/1683,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 15th instant I have received per the 5 hand canoe, with 3 whitemen, vizt Robert Crow, John Younger and George Browne. You seeme to be much concerned why wee have noe greater trade. I have given severall reasons in formers, as here being soe many forts soe neare that itt spoyles the trade, and that soe many interlopers comeing downe dayly to Tishee 3 leagues to leward, which causes soe great a resort of up country people to flock thither that in a manner all the forts are voyde of trade, for there they goe and noe one mollests them; but if here were good store of sletias and sheets they would vend suddainely. And as to what you write [that] you have not received above 12 or 13 marks in 16 months time, if you please to inspect a little farther you will find 16m 3o 15a 4ta paid, which indeed is a verry inconsiderable sume for the time, I wish cinceerly itt could have been 100 fold more, that then some creditt might redound to mee and not allways receive cheques and ill resentments. And as to what your honour blames mee in not sending Mr Windovers goods up I askt Mr Towgood to take them in, whoe told mee hee was soe full hee could not unless they were to put upon the spindle of his vaine. I have according to order sent up Christmass Cock, hope your honour will please to send him againe after the worke is finisht. The Portugueze are all goeing away and leave the fort to the Danes. The Dutch Copeman here hath as I am inform'd wrote to the Generall to gett itt into their hands: itt stands the best for a leward trade, and if your honour thinks fitt intercept the Dutch. Thus much in breife."
449,1,449,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,08/03/1683,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 3rd instant per Mr Towgood is now before me. I likewise have received 6 cases of sletias course, 2 ditto fine, 10 barrells powder and 6 chests of sheets for the account of the Royall Affrican Company of England, which according to order shall endeavour to utmost of power to dispose of for gold. I have also sent up what goods are Mr Wendovers, only 5 old chaires and an old rotten table which I leave Mr Towgood to give his approbation of the vallue, also one forke that was stole within two dayes after my arrivall here. I have also sent the account enclosed of what is sent. I have now likewise sent 3m 4o 0a 8ta, which just makes up 20m. Had not the Dutch sent downe yesterday a vessell with the said goods that came from Capo Corso I might have sold all this month that came by the sloope. The sloope hath been here 2 dayes and upwards, but by reason of great raines, high seas and turnadoes could not adventure to unload any thing till weather presented, which was this morning. I shall send my February account per the canoe, which may arrive your Honour before this."
450,1,450,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,09/03/1683,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 3rd instant per the Ann Sloope have received, with 10 barrells powder, 6 cases of course sletias, 2 ditto of fine and 6 chests of sheets, of which I have sold 2 chests and want the prices of sletias. The powder will sell speedily for a benda per barrell. The Dutch accidentally next day received the same sort of goods, else should have sold most of the sheets ere this and sletias. All the mony I could make till the 7th instant, being 3m 4o 0a 8ta, I have per the sloope sent up as per Mr Towgoods receipt. This day arrived here two shipps, what they are I know not, which are traders and will imagine goe to Tishae. Nothing of moment presents but as any thing shall offer shall advise.

451,1,451,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,14/03/1683,Fort,RAC,"My last to you was of the 9th instant, in which was nothing of any concequence but what had wrote before per the Ann Sloope, Mr Charles Towgood Comander, hope ere this both are received, with the mony sent for my Royall Masters account and also the last months account. I had not wrote now soe suddenly but only for a supply of sheets, the former being all sold and am now importuned for more, if had 10 chests this day would have made good sayle, soe if your Honours will supply with what goods will vend, you need not question good sales and good mony. I have 4m now since the 7th instant for sheets and sletias and have refused good slaves for powder because of want of orders for buying slaves. I insert what is wanting underneath, which pray lett be sent and mony in a month shall not be wanting, as am promised. This morning came news from Allampa that Accruffee and Ahenesas people coming downe to Allampa, they [i.e. the Allampas] are againe fled over the river of Volta; and 9 great canoes that came downe for cows and sheep are all return'd empty, only loaded with passengers, soe that if you purpose to send there for slaves none at present are to be gott.
20 chests sheets att 78a
200 course sletias at 5 a each
halfe barrells of powder, either empty or full, to fill what I have into, for they vend
best
for the use of the fort a barrell of mallageta 2 pickaxes and 2 shovells"
452,1,452,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,22/03/1683,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 19th currant per Mr Towgood in the Ann Sloope have received, with 8 chests of sheets, 8 chests of sletias and 12 halfe barrells of powder, all in good condition, only tooke a little wett per great seas coming on shoare, all which according to order shall dispose of to my Royall Masters best advantage. I have likewise followed your orders in sending up what gold I have and have not left one ounce in the fort, the sum now sent is just 5 marks, which finding wright please to advise per next the receipt thereof. Your Honours mention nothing in yours about the receipt of Mr Wendovers things sent per your orders in the sloope. The very next day after the departure of the sloope, being the 9th instant, Ahenesa went to fight to Allampa, elce should have made a large sum. Just as his fetish tells him he must goe, noe one knew the day before thereof, soe uncertaine he is in all his actions of warr that noe councill is to determine the success apparent either maligne or otherwise, but only the dictates of a few braines.
[PS] Here is 2 brass pattareras with 2 chambers [with] the mettle soe bad [we] cannot use them; also 1 gun about 500 lb which wants a vent, soe beg an exchange or elce order to send them up.
Pray furnish me with a little inke, 2 shovells, 2 pickaxes, 300 barrs iron."
453,1,453,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,05/05/1683,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 3rd instant is now before mee, to which shall according to commands answer. Oppertunity before could not find place to answer to your Honours per the letter per Woolliford, likewise per Captain Lowe, occasioned thus, vizt on the 7th past haveing occasion to goe into the warehouse in the morning to deliver some goods sold, tooke the key out of my breeches pockett and staid there but a verry small time. When I went above I found my scretore open, and mistrusting I was wrong'd (or my masters leastwise) and upon search found what I would not, for weighing the Companys money I found wanting upwards of a marke, and upon examination understood itt was a free boy that lived with mee. I went and demanded him of his freinds and they denyed him, on which loath to be wrong'd I caus'd all the guns that could beare on the towne to be shotted and fired, which were accordingly performed; and about 3 or 4 hundred appear'd against our fort with small amies and tired. I made as good work as could and did maintaine a fight for 3 dayes, but the rogues all shelter'd themselves in the Dutch fort att last, and when they saw that I would have my money againe they called a pallavora and sent the money, but what I now insist on is for the payment of my powder and shott, which still they denie, yett am freinds and have a good correspondency with them, soe if your honour thinks convenient to desist of my demands I humbly crave a word. And I think there is Accra's enough in Cape Coast to satisfie 2 barrells powder and shott, which will be better then meddle with them here, for reasons your honour knowes, vizt spoyle of trade etc. These are the cheife and only reasons has hinder'd and prevented mee from wrighting, and [also] their hindering the Companys pawnes from comeing to mee when sent for, which if your honour please to weigh in the ballance of your reason will find itt not to be suffered where a fort is. The Dutch Copeman writt his brother about my fireing in his towne, suppose your Honour has advice thereof but wee are much together; I have now his carpenter and cooper both
att worke and hee hath two of the Companys Black maisons for him. I perceive per your honours that itt is your honours pleasure I should buy slaves att the rates of goods 3 lb prime cost, soe desire an invoyce for direction for such goods as have here as per account, that I may know the better to govern my selfe thereby, for goods in England rizes and falls. I have here likewise sent the key of the warehouse and desire itt may be mended, a peece is broken almost off. I have alsoe sent up the last months account and this months, ending this day, per which your honour will find due to the Royall Affrican Company 8m lo 2a lta, which if your honour had ordered itt up per any one that could give a receipt for't should have delivered itt. The Dutch have little or noe goods here. Your honour is pleased to say you will supply mee with what goods I want, which is only sheets and good sayes. I have sayes as per account 42, but 20 I wrote were received per Churchey in the case which are all much damnified, and have not 10 good ones in the Castle. The Dutch has sold sayes as long as had any goods att an ounce, and I never abated of 18a according to your orders for what were good and will not abate but rather rise. Redd perpettuanoes ly's by and spoyles, soe per permission begg what may sell for and other damag'd goods, which doe my endeavour. I purpose to make a generall sale of damag'd goods and cleare the warehouse when the up country people comes downe, that they may give notice thereof, but the waters are soe high and cannot pass as yett. It was in Mr Amy's time accustomary once every yeare that soe what were a little damaged might not be quite spoyle'd and lost, and I beleeve here is sayes now that was in his time to my knowledge 4 yeares. Your honour may perceive per my March accompts how sheets sold, and if had twice as many more they had all been sold att same rates; I suppose there is a good quantity att Cabo Corsoe. I want carriages for most of the guns in the fort, if any spare ones pray lett mee not want. Likewise powder in halfe barrells; plank[s], if any some deales, for spouts to convey water into the tank; 6 [and] 8 nailes 12 per hooks and hinges for doores. The raines are verry much with us, haveing not had this 10 dayes one faire day. This I humbly begg may find a favourable reception, being the verryty of my silence and truth of all the Roy all Companys concerns, and as quick expediated answer as your Honour could desire, which per the carrecter you may perceive."
454,1,454,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,14/05/1683,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 12th instant I received last night, and had then made answer thereto, but the weather proving bad and the canoemen weary deferr'd itt till this morning.
I am sorry to heare that Captain Lumly come to that bad fate, but understand per the Serjant of Axim which they brought downe to Tishae that they gave him his ship etc. againe and [he] related all accidents that happened from Axim to this place, which is too tedious to relate and indeed doe not remember all, being spoken in Dutch. Yesterday morning one of them [i.e. the pirates] with Captain Thompsons ship past by in the offing, and the Brandenburger, and about 11 a clock stood into the shoare and came to an anchor at Tishee, and about 3 a clock the 3 hand canoe past by here, and question not but arriv'd a day before the ships att Arda and hope Captain Lowe will be well provided for them ere they come. Captain Summervill as per said Serjants report inform'd them that Captain Lowe had above 300 marks of gold of the Companys aboard, which made one to hast soe suddainely away, the other is now att Laggue. When the sloope shall arrive will observe all your honours orders in order to her protection and alsoe to the Royall Companys concerns ashoare, and desire noe better sport then to see them land 100 men, for I with the Dutch have given small matter to oblige the blacks and alsoe have promised powder and armes if occasion should bee, which doe not feare in the least. They take noe goods nor slaves from any but gold and plate etc. I have been this 3 dayes much troubled with the bloody flux, which has not yett left mee and weakens mee much."
455,1,455,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,22/05/1683,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 11th instant per Mr Towgood I have before mee, in which you admire I could not secure money from my boyes. Your Honour may be assured I keepe itt not soe slightly as may be by you conjectur'd, but as itt was the Companys money I ought to endeavour the regaining thereof. I have not hindered noe trade thereby, for the Accraa's have noe money to trade withall; and as I wrought all differances are att an end and itt is better to make rogues to comply with foule meanes then by flattery, for being once brought under subjection a yoake seemes not weighty etc. I have according to order sent up the ballance of my last Months accompt being 8m 1o 2a lta per the Ann Sloope, Mr Charles Towgood Commander, and made as quick dispatch for him as possible could. Had your honour wrote for ballance of accompts to this day your honour should have had 3m more which have by mee; and question not but should within this 3 dayes had money enough to pay the people on next Fry day, for sheets are only now good, and sayes I question not but will vend att the rate your honour setts, loz. One chest of sayes I begg your Honour to enquire of Mr Towgood, which I opened and hee saw was not good, which I am apt to creditt were sayes has long layde by, and were damaged and much discoloured. Have not as yett opened any more. Slaves are verry scarce and cannot procure any att rates proposed, unless had powder to advance other goods. I could have sold severall barrells this month at 2oz per barrell, but will not disfurnish the fort. [We need] a bale of green perpettuanoes, 300 good iron barrs, and shott from 2 lb to 6 lb, for have but verry few left. Nay in verrity shall have noe occasion for any unless have not timber or new carriages, for to my knowledge never this 4 years was any to supply this place and can scarce play a gun on what wee have. This I wright if any occasion should happen, but as long as under your honours command here none shall ere possess but the Royall Company. I have given an accompt to Boby, Ahenesahs sonn, that on the last of this month all goods both little and much damag'd should be sold, and hee promised to bring downe severall men that are considerable traiders with him and give notice thereof to the adjacent country's. I desire your honour that all the articles that were made by your honour (for good disapline and government of men att Cabo Corso vizt for goeing into towne without my knowledge, whoreing and keeping wenches in the fort, swearing etc.) may be sent mee sign'd by your Worship and Councill, which He see performe'd. I have received all things exprest in your honours that were aboard the Ann Sloope. I am much in want for some padlocks; I have sent both the lock and key of the warehouse, the brazeing the key was too weake which would not turne the spring etc. The fiscal of the Mina is here att Accra and the Copeman and hee hath sent both to mee and Charles Towgood to accompany them this afternoone, which purpose to doe."
456,1,456,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,12/06/1683,Fort,RAC,"Yours per Captain Lumley of the 11th past and 24th per the ketch, Mr John Groome Commander, I have received. I would have followed your honours order in the delivery of the slaves to Captain Lumley, but hee would allow mee but 4 course sletias a piece, one with another, att which rates cannot procure more, neither doe I know when shall att the rates proposed. The raines have been soe greate in the country that noe people can come downe, only yesterday some people came which layde out about 5 bendy's in sheets and one barrell of powder. The last weeke Atta Barba came from Anguina, but I had sent twice before for him to come downe and open the way for a trade from thence, for many up country people come there, as the Akims, Taquoa [var. Toquoa] and other nations, soe hee sayes after your Honour pleases to considder itt and send for him hee will waite on you att Cabo Corsoe to discourse farther about other affaires, soe per returne of this canoe I expect to heare what your honours good pleasure is. I wrote your honour in my last per Mr Towgood for iron barrs and green perpettuanoes but as yett have had noe 
answer, which begg a supply for I have none of those that are good. I have alsoe enclosed my May's accompt which is less then what I expected, which was occasioned per raines above recited. I am straitened for corne, not haveing above 6 chests in the fort, and here is none to be had for money att any rates; soe begg a supply within this weeke, elce must send what slaves I have to Cabo Corsoe in the 5 hand canoe for they will be starv'd elce. Captain Groome is now at Tishee, and I admire hee hath not sent a canoe to informe your honour what trade, for I told him I would deferr wrighting till hee sent. George Browne saith that hee left but 4 per anno to his wife in England, but they that cast his sallary up makes itt to be 4 12s 7d, soe that itt will att 13 months per anno amount to 7a 8ta per month but it is sett downe noe more then 7a 6ta per month."
457,1,457,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,03/07/1683,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 23rd past per Mr Towgood and of the 28th ditto per John Lord in the canoe is now in view and according to your orders have donn what you required and commanded, and with all doe as much wonder as you admire why noe more money is remitted, which I with submission reply if trade presents not, I am noe quiner [= coiner?] of gold (which expression pray pardon). In mee lyes noe fault for itt would certainely redound much more to my creditt and advantage that more money presented, and will per Mr Towgood remitt 12m of gold which I have now by mee, and would per the bearer if you had in the least commanded I would have obeyed. Have now under command of the Roy all Company s fort the sloope, and Mr Towgood waites only your orders for proceeding, not that I detaine him but desire that all things may be don for the best, and desire your Honour soe to censure. Shall per Mr Towgood more largely answer, this only begg 30 or 40 chests of sheetes as soone as possible, for they are much enquired after and have none left and itt will be a meanes to put other goods off. Have nothing elce to add only to request suddain newes of the pyrates arrivall, that soe I may give advice to Mr Groome and Mr Harper, whoe hath wrote me to send them word."
458,1,458,Ralph Hassell,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,09/07/1683,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 7th instant received yesterday, and immediatly gave the canoemen cankey money and dispatcht them to Mr Groome. In answer to your honours of the 23rd June, I wonder what should be the reason why my waights doe not hould out with those att Cabo Corsoe, being the Companys weights given to master of a ship, or elce certainely greate waight is made att Cabo Corsoe, for I made good weight here. Yett nevertheless I have sent up the money wanting, which is 9a 5ta. Alsoe now per Mr Towgood my Junes accompt with the ballance thereof being 12m lo 5a 2ta. Alsoe you seeme to admire why I take noe more money, considering the quantity of goods I have, which I must acknowledge I never knew this place better furnished for upwards of 4 yeares then now itt is, but if traders are not suffered to come downe, whoe are hindered per Ahenesah, elce Arcany's and Ackims would bring twice as much trade here as att Cabo Corsoe, and all what ever hee buy's hee makes them pay treble the prime cost here. I have likewise shipt what slaves Captain Charles [Towgood] would chuse, which is 4 men, 8 woemen and 1 girle, and also two carriages for guns, one is for a saker the other a minion. And as for my complayning of goods being damnified, please to send any of your Councell to inspect them whoe may be competent judges and sett rates on them, He be responsable for what hee or they shall vallue them att provided they sell for as much. Your honours orders I have sett up att the gate and am seveere in seeing them prosecuted according to order, and not one free woeman I suffer to lye in the fort, which seemes tedious to those soe habbituated and make them raile against mee, speaking hardly about itt, which I question not but your Honour has heard thereof or will suddainely, yett nevertheless Ile performe your commands. Have received every thing per the sloope as your honour advised. As for the nero and strafino corall I expect within this day or two a marke for the moiety, which will answer what I expected, which will doe more then purchase 4 slaves. Atta Barba is now with mee and has brought 5 bendy's for sheets, and had I 50 chests I would sell them in a months time and other goods with them. Hee purposes to Cabo Corsoe next weeke; this night he goes to Barracoe. Have dispatcht the sloope with wood water and corne sufficient for the slaves, and alsoe spar'd 1 iron bound teirce and 1 barrell which I expediated as soone as received your command."
459,1,459,Robert Young,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,11/07/1683,Fort,RAC,"This serves only to acquaint you that on Tuseday night my selfe with Mr Nightingale and the soulders landed here and delivered Mr Hassell your order for the delivery of the fort, which hee noe sooner read but hee immediatly caused the souldiers to be drawne up and delivered mee the key of the fort, and as soone as I had possession I read my owne orders before all of them in armes and commanded them that they were in my orders, to dismiss their armes and immediatly to gett their things ready and repaire on board the sloope; but a great sea riseing and night comeing on I sent them away before itt was darke. And likewise this day two men which I understand had turned the master of the small Barbadian interloper, his mate and carpenter out of the ship in this roade, the master comeing on shoare made his complaint to Mr Hassell, whoe with a greate canoe went on board with him and went in. Mr Hassell haveing given his canoemen a signe, they seized them and threw them overboard. The master haveing gott possession of his ship againe is weighed and gon off the coast. Wee shall make an end of inventorying the Company s goods today and shall if weather permitt send Mr Hassell away in the sloope to morrow night. Here arrived in the roade an English canoe from Ardra but can not say any thing of the newes because shee was afraid of the sea which went on shoare, but there is noe whitemen come with them. Wee have sent up to give Ahenesa ackey and to acquaint him of our arrivall here. Our trade att present is not verry good for gold but indifferant for slaves. The fort is almost as bad as the Danes hill, one flanker is fallen in, but the best is, the tank houlds water verry well and wee should not be behoulden to none but that wee want good spouts, and if your Worship thinks fitt to send a few deales downe, He doe my endeavour to gett them made by the first carpenter that comes downe. Here is some lyme Mr Hassell left to repaire the fort, which shall begin to doe as soone as hee is gon. Here is abundance of goods, but most of them damnified but what Charles [Towgood] brought downe this last time."
460,1,460,Robert Young/James Nightingale,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,12/07/1683,Fort,RAC,"This accompany's Mr Hassell whoe imbarques along with Mr Towgood, and according to your Worship and Councills orders have sealed his chest and scretore up and have delivered them to Charles to take care of the seale of them. I was forct to seale them with Mr Hassells seale, because mine with Mr Nightingall's was on board Mr Sheares, but I shall send itt up enclosed in a letter by Captain Quow. I with Mr Nightingale have given him a receipt for all the goods and what wee found in the Castle. I hope wee shall have itt in a little better case then itt is at present.
[PS] I have received of Mr Hassell 3 marks, 2 ounces and 1 taccoe of gold for the ballance of his account and have taken Charles Towgoods receipt for the same."
461,1,461,James Nightingale,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,13/07/1683,Fort,RAC,"I render your honour humble thanks for your kindess I have received, but especially for your fatherly advice, and pray doe not doubt but that in all things I shall be verry obedient to your honours commands and will with the assistance of Mr Robert Young my Cheife doe my utmost to promote my masters interest. I have heard the Dutch Copemen say just after Mr Hassells departure that Mr Hassell had advice of our comeing 3 day's before our arrivall here. Your honours will heare all the actions and transactions against Mr Hassell of the people which are sent up, I doe assure your honour the one will betray the other. In the interim I refer the rest to our generall letter."
462,1,462,Robert Young/James Nightingale,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,13/07/1683,Fort,RAC,"This accompany's Captain Quow and Tom Amamaboe, and have sent enclosed the inventory of the remaaines of the Company's concerns in this place, and likewise Mr Hassells accompt which [we] brought from Cabo Corsoe with us, and since his departure in one of the roomes we have found a chest where was 30 peeces of Cape Verd cloaths belonging to Mr Hassell, the Serjant and some others, which they bought of an interloper, but most damag'd, and likewise in overhauling the warehouse wee found 31 brass kettles which had formerly been in his account but not in this that we had with us, and have sent likewise a paper enclosed of what George Browne sayes against Mr Hassell, and as soone as hee is any thing well shall send him up per first oppertunity. Wee need not write any thing of the damaged goods for your Worship will see that per the invoyce. As concerning the trade wee can say nothing to att present, haveing not heard from Ahenesah but expect them dayley. Wee desire your Worship to send downe per first conveyance some iron, blew pautka's and sheets which the natives now enquire after, and by that time hope shall have some money to send up. All things seeme to stand verry well between the natives and us, they being verry well satisfied att Mr Hassells departure and our comeing. Questioning not but through our endeavours to bring a good trade againe."

As concerning the trade itt is but little att present and the goods which att present vend most is as formerly wrote, as iron, sheets, powder, and some enquire after blew pautka's. Wee have taken upwards of 2 marks, but paying the people here, that is in pay, hath diminished a little. Here is noe trade come from Quomboe as yett, his sonn and the man which alway's was our messenger is up in the country, but when itt doth come itt is all att once. Wee have purchased 7 slaves and could have had more, but wee stand for one man and one woeman, men slaves being verry scarce here. Here lyeth Agent Pearson and Captain Parris. Mr John Groome hath filled some water here and hath taken in some wood and doth intend for Cabo Corso, his goods being much damag'd, but hath 30 odd verry good slaves in and some gold. I have put on board him 3 old gunns and 2 patteraro's for to be delivered ashoare att Cabo Corsoe, they being not fitt for any service, and according to your order I shall sett the people to repaire this fort and will be as spareing in the charges as possible and will not lett the Companys slaves build the Dutch fort, and lett ours fall. Your Worship would doe us a kindness if you can spare 3 or 400 hundred of bricks, 2 shovells, 2 trowells, 1 pickax, with 2 small gunns with things appertaining, and 6 of the Companys musketts new and well fixed, for here is not one muskett fitt to use but a man snaps almost a hundred times before itt will fire.

A Monday here arrived from Ahenesah his two sonns with some Arcany Cabasheers and they tell mee that their father Ahenesah saith that if I have good goods I shall not want for a trade both for money and  slaves, and I acquainted them that I had your Worship and Councills promise for what goods I wanted and have made them wellcome. They enquired for sheets but wee haveing none, they have bought some sayes, some powder and some musketts.

One ship lying in sight and giveing those rates, wee buy none, but Ahenesah hath promised mee to gett some slaves, against the sloope comes. I would desire your Worship to send downe one chest of good bright musketts, for they would sell here, these being old and have been a long time here. The Dutch sells their musketts and sheets for slaves and disposes of them [i.e. slaves] againe to the interlopers, which hope for the future may be but few.

476,1,476,John Thorne,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,24/05/1681,Fort,RAC,"Att our arrivall at Whidaw Captain Lowe came to an anchor, and by his and Mr Gouldings order I was sent on shoare to learne how affaires stood here and att Ophra and att which place was most probability of his quick dispatch, and next day returned on board againe with answer from the King that if Captain Lowe would come on shoare himselfe hee would contract with him for his whole complement of slaves, whereupon he and Mr Goulding went on shoare and the King likeing his cargoe promised him his slaves in 26 dayes, which might have been accomplished had there not come two interlopers, a Portuguese and a French ship into the roade. Captain Lowe haveing gott goods on shoare, Mr Goulding bought slaves at Sabba [var. Saba] the Kings house, and I was ordered at Agriffie the lower towne, where when wee had purchased his whole complement of slaves hee would have had the remaines off againe, but finding it something difficult, and Captain Lowes ship springeing a great leake, twas thought most convenient to leave the goods on shoare and mee with them then to delay time for the aforesaid reasons. I have built  noe house yett but if your worship think itt convenient to settle here I desire you to send mee orders for itt, and another man which is a good accountant, which I judge may be very beneficial for the Royall Companys interest, this place being not above 4 or 5 hours journey from Ophra and the charges being the same at both places. Besides the King [of Whidaw] and Phidolgo [of Ophra] are great friends againe and are desireous of a free traid againe. I have only the 3 hand canoe left and the great canoe went downe to Ophra and was staved in goeing ashoare with the goods, the weather being very bad and Captain Lowe unwilling to stay by reason of the leake, and I understand there is never a canoe att Ophra and desire you will be pleased to send one by the next ship. As for the canoemen, I have not paid them their halfe pay, because they would not goe downe to Ophra with the canoe and neglected their busieness here for the 3 last dayes. I have been downe at Ophra and find the factory was all burnt downe but is almost finished againe and a very secure trunck built and things very well settled. I find Mr Cross to be a very civill gentleman and none that is as well deserving as capable of the place. I was ordered to be accountable to Mr Goulding att Ophra, but hee being dead and Mr Cross succeeding have brought them to him [i.e. Cross], whoe hath sent them up with his owne."
477,1,477,William Cross,Offra,,Cape Coast Castle,18/08/1681,Fort,RAC,"I humbley presume to give your worship the trouble of these few lines to certifie you of my departure with Captain Branfill, and how hee made a shift to pick up his slaves in about 20 days with those goods and some money [which] hee brought; but tis very inconvenient for a ship to come here without booges, and if you send none by the next ship, you must hardly expect any slaves; but if you purchase any [booges] att the Mina Castle (where I heare there is plenty) you may be sure of slaves in a very short time, and if you send but halfe the cargoe of the next ship in booges, any other goods you have will goe off except iron barres. I am sorry I am to send you the unhappy news of Mr Gouldings death, whoe died on the 5th of May  last, hee lay sick but 4 dayes, all which time I had the Dutch docter with him, who att first comeing told mee he was a dead man, after hee understood what hee had taken, which was too large a potion of some physick hee brought downe here with him, being enough for neare three times takeing, as the docter told mee, and being not sick before found nothing to worke upon but an empty stomack, yett held him vomitting for two dayes or more and the rest of the time lay speechless and in 4 dayes died about 3 in the afternoone. Captain Lowe tooke in his slaves at Whidda, where hee left Mr Thorne and Robert Chapman with the remaines, but upon Mr Gouldings death and my goeing home hee [= Thorne] is come downe to Ophra to take possession here, who is a man that is very capable and deserving of the place and one that knows the custome of the country, which is not presently found out by a newcomer, and if your worship please to send downe another man to him that is an accountant, I doe not question but hee shall manage the Company's affaires here better then anyone you can propose to send downe. Captain Low had promised the King of Whiddah to settle a factory there, for which reason would not lett bring away what goods were on shoare after hee had bought his slaves, but was forced to leave Mr Thorne with them, an account of which you will find in his letter, and likewise an account of which goods hee put on shoare herein inclosed. Since I am goeing home, I think tis most convenient for mee to carry my accounts home to the Company, and not trouble you with them. I dispatched Captain Bowler from hence with 87 slaves according to your worships order in Mr Gouldings letter, and the directions Mr Nightingale gave, which has took up almost all the booges Captain Lowe put on shoare, soe that I shall leave Mr Thorne very bare, if you doe not send him some recrute very speedily. Wee had noe goods before but iron barrs, for on the 12th of March last happened a great fire which burnt down almost all the whole towne together with our factory, but I have neare built itt againe and built a very secure warehouse, which I have covered with iron barrs to secure the goods from a second fire, if it should chance to happen. All our goods in a manner were burnt except iron barrs, of which you will find an account by Mr Thorns receipt of the remayns here. I have Mr Gouldings papers and a bill of ladeing for 529 slaves which I have put up to carry home to the Company, but cannot find among them all the account of the particulars of canoe hyre you paid, 4 ounces odd angles, which I have sought after very carefully, finding you writt so earnestly for itt. The great canoe was staved upon the breakers in comeing ashoare, and wee had a 7 hand canoe here before, which broak loose from Captain Lowes sterne in a tournadoe, soe that att present wee have none but the 3 hand canoe to helpe our selves, and I have bin beholden to the Dutch for Captain Bowler and Captain Bramfill both, for the use of their canoes, whoe had 3 very good ones, but I have broke two by the badness of the weather. You may be pleased to send Mr Thorne a good canoe or two with some paddles, here are 13 canoemen already which are pawnes to the Company, soe that then hee shall have occasion for noe more, but if you send any send noe more free men for they proved themselves rogues to Captain Lowe.
PS. Your worship may be pleased to understand that when you send any ships for this place to consigne them to the factor, for if you raise the price of goods (as I have lately seen) the Blacks will never lower them againe.

478,1,478,John Thorne,Offra,,Cape Coast Castle,19/08/1681,Fort,RAC,"I hearing of Captain Parris quick dispatch last voyage att Whida, encouraged Captain Lowe to take in his slaves there, but after hee had gott his slaves, haveing promised the King to settle a factory there, hee [= the King] would not lett the goods which were on shoare be brought off, whereupon Captain Lowe and Mr Goulding ordered mee and Robert Chapman to stay with them there, an account of which you will find herein inclosed. It being put to Mr Croses choise to goe home or stay, hee sent for mee downe to Ophra to take possession of the Companys concerns, which libberty I could hardly obtaine because of Captain Low's promise to the King, but was forced to come away without my things, neither can I gett the other man away, but think it convenient (with your worshipps order) to keepe both places, for I find them very civill and obledgeing there, and a place as plenty of slaves as this, and are within foure hours journey one of the other, and by keeping both places will be a furtherance of the dispatch of all ships you shall send downe; by which if you send booges a good quantity, with allmost any other goods you have you cannot want slaves, for they are very plenty. I humbly begg of your worshipp to send downe a man or two, and one in the roome of James Boyde, for hee has been very falce to Mr Cross, and promised the Blacks 12 slaves in goods, if they would send him [= Cross] away, and make the other cheife, so that hee might have the command of the factory, to imbazle thee Company's goods as he pleased, but some of the Blacks haveing a kindness for Mr Cross came and told him of itt, whereby itt was prevented, this is the greatest occasion of his [= Cross's] goeing home now as hee himselfe has told mee, and as far as I understand this rogue has the same designe upon mee, for I have heard some inclining of itt, and am sencible by the very same craft this factory has often been ruinated, and the Company not only lost their goods, but a great many honest men their lives, therefore I hope you will be pleased to take itt into consideration. Wee have great occasion for a canoe or two, and some paddles, the great canoe was staved upon the breakers, and a 7 hand canoe which was here was broken adrift in a turnadoe, soe that at present wee have great want of canoes, and you had as good send noe ships as noe canoes, for without them nothing can be done. Pray send some booges by the next shipping, and they will put off any goods you shall send downe besides, without them you must expect little to be done, for tis all one their money here, as silver and gold is wth us.

479,1,479,John Thorne,Offra,,Cape Coast Castle,04/12/1681,Fort,RAC,"Heareing of Captain Parris quick dispatch last voyage att Whidda, I encouraged Captain Low to take in his slaves there, and comeing to anchor in the road I was sent on shoare by Captain Lowe and Mr Gouldings order to know how things past as well att Ophra as Whida and in which place I might best and soonest purchase his slaves, and the next day returning on board againe with answer from the King that if Captain Lowe will come himselfe on shoare hee would agree with him for his whole complement of slaves, whereupon Captain Lowe and Mr Goulding went on shoare and the King likeing his cargoe promised him his slaves in 26 dayes, which might have been accomplished had there not come two interlopers into the road, a French man and a Portuguese. Captain Lowe haveing gott goods ashoare Mr Goulding bought slaves att the Kings house att Sabba [var. Saba] and I was ordered at Agriffie the lower towne, but after hee had gott all his slaves, and haveing before promised the King to settle a factory there, hee [= the King] would not lett the goods which were on shoare be carried off, whereupon Captain Lowe and Mr Goulding ordered mee and Robert Chapman to stay with them there, an account of them you will find enclosed herein. Therefore if your worship be pleased to settle a factory lett mee have your order for itt, that I may make provision for the reception of any ships you shall be pleased to send. I have little to say in the praise of the place, only itt is something more healthfull then Ophra and is a place of free trade for all ships that comes. There is two factory's already, a French and a Portuguese, and interlopers dayley frequent the place. I have done my best to prevent them, to the hazard of my life by one Captain Beacon, who sett a pistole to my breast but I prevented his designe, for the Blacks will have noe striveing one with another but will have all ships trade that comes. Therefore if your worshipp please to continue this place at Whidda itt will require two whitemen, for I have but two with mee, for itt being put to Mr Crosses choyse to goe home or stay he sent for mee to Ophra to take possession of the Companys concerns, the which libberty I could hardly obtaine because of Captain Low's promise to the King, but was forced to come away without anything for my necessaries, neither can I as yet gett the other white man away, though I have made tryall to the loss of all that I brought out of England with mee. If both places be kept itt will be a meanes to dispatch ships the sooner, for there is butt 4 or 5 hours journey betwixt them and you cannot miss of slaves att either place if you send any quantity of booges, and they will be a meanes to put off almost any other sort of goods except iron barrs. A note of what goods is vendible you will find inclosed herein. Wee have great occasion for a canoe or two and some padles. The great canoe was stav'd upon the breakers and the 7 hand canoe broke away from the sterne of Captain Low's ship in a turnadoe, soe that wee have great need of canoes and you had as good send noe ships as noe canoes. For canoemen I have 13 here, and if you send downe any more pray lett them be pawnes, for those which came with Captain Low proved rogues. For the last 3 dayes when there was most occasion for them, could not gett them to carry off the slaves, to Captain Lowes great damage, but was forced to hyre others, for which offence I hope your Worship will be pleased to take itt into consideration. Captain Lowe departed from Whidda the 20th Aprill last with his complement of slaves and sent Mr Goulding on shoare att Ophra, and what goods came on shoare there Mr Cross I hope certifies you in his letters, and likewise of Mr Gouldings death, hee being spectator, and therefore needless to insert itt here, and of his charges in rebuilding some small part of the factory, and what hee hath left mee to build, which will cost 26 slaves to compleat itt, and I have not wherewithall to pay for itt, but the Blacks are soe civill to stay till the next ship comes. Captain Parris lately arriv'd at Whidda, where in a short time gott his complement of slaves and departed the 20th of this instant, leaveing Mr Wyborne to settle a factory, and the said Mr Wyborne is now building a large house for the reception of interlopers. Captain Rickard departed hence the 12th November haveing gott his complement of slaves in 20 dayes for money and what goods hee brought with him, for I had not any goods to supply him with all but iron barrs, and they will not off here upon any account. Pray be pleased to send downe money to pay the souldiers their wages, for here is two which are 12 months behind and the other 6 months and myselfe likewise, for I want cloaths and other necessaries. The Phidalgoe would desire your Worship to send him a dram cup.

480,1,480,John Thorne,Offra,,Cape Coast Castle,18/12/1681,Fort,RAC,"This comes with the accounts of Ophra and to certifie you how things are with us att Arda, haveing no knowledge of men [sic  omission?] a canoe goeing from Widdaw, by reason of the canoemen which went in her were those which came downe with Captain Lowe and they haveing soe plaid the rogue with him I durst not send any letters by them if I had known of her goeing, for fear of their miscariage. These accounts att Ophra may seeme something strange to your worship, if you had butt seen what condition I found the factory in and what bad customes factors had brought up here since I went home, not knowing how to deale with the Blacks, for they are a very encroching people to men that are strangers to their customes, and I have been forced to be att an extraordinary charge in reducing them to their former customes againe and I hope to continue itt whilst I have the power in my hands, but if your worship send another above mee I doe not know how hee will deale with them, for the Blacks will not lett any instructions to be given to a new Cheife but will make him condition with them before hee shall have any considerable discourse with the old Cheife about their customes, but I hope the next account will be more easier to the Company then this, for the charge hath been ogmented in regard of an unhappy war which broke forth among the Blacks and I was forced to give 2 slaves for one barrell of powder for to secure the Companys concerns. If Mr Wyborne please, who is the bearer of this letter and accounts, hee can give you certifection att large. The same thing is by masters of ships as by a new factor, for when they have the cargoe in their owne disposeing the Blacks will have things att their own rate, knowing that they know nothing of the customes of the country.
I would desire your worship to send booges downe by the first oppertunity for I have none for my present use but am forct to borrow of the blacks, and they will not lend above 50 lbs of booges for a slave and att the arrivall of a ship will have 78 lbs for them, for I have not any goods that I can put off for booges but to great loss. James Boyde humbly requests of your worshipp to send him your discharge for hee is willing to goe home, his time being expired. If you please to send him his discharge pray send two honest men downe which can wright, for John Waterhouse is dead and shall have but two left which is not enough for this.
PS. Here is a great man who desires your worship to send him a drum and hee will send you a slave for itt.

481,1,481,Petley Wyburne,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,08/01/1682,Fort,RAC,"The bearer Yanky hath been here some time to come up to the Gold Coast with mee, but I not being ready and here being a blacks canoe comeing up Mr Thorne sent to mee to send Yankey, which I now doe with your letters by her. Some small time since I have been att Ophra, where I saw the Companys factory and a considerable parcell of iron in itt but very little other goods. Slaves are to be had here if they that wants brings goods fitt for the place, as booges, brass, linnen, pintadoes, beads, etc. If itt lieth in my power to serve the Company or yourselfe, there is nothing wants but your commands or oppertunity, and assure you I will faithfully."
482,1,482,John Thorne,Offra,,Cape Coast Castle,23/03/1682,Fort,RAC,"I received your letter per Mr Arthur Wendover, which orders my departure off the coast for England. I would most willingly have compplied therewith could those persons you have sent down discharged the debts I have bin forc't to contract with the blacks, for want of booges or other goods to maintaine the factory, but till that is complied with they will not lett me goe. I have obeyed your orders in delivering an account to Mr John Winder of all the Royall Company concerns that have been in my charge, copies whereof I have sent to Capo Corsoe, and have always endeavoured to give advice of affaires here as well to the Agent and Councill as to my masters in England. I am sure I have been at great charge and have lost considerably since I came downe last, by sollicitous dilligence in the Royall Company service, however I see my honest endeavors have been ill represented or not well accepted. When I was ordered from Whidah to Ophrah by Mr Cross I lost the greatest part of my things to the vallue of 14 slaves, they being seized on by the King of Whidah, for noe other reason then my leaving his country, for the service of the Royall Company. I hope some consideration may be allowed for it, otherwise people will have little encouragement to serve the Company. I likewise paid 2 slaves for a flag and staff, which never was put in my account. I am heartily sorry I am turned out of my imployment without any reason given. I will obey your order as soone as possible I can, which cannot be until the ballance of my account is sent downe which I owe to the Blacks of this towne, having borrowed it out of necessity. I much admire I could receive noe answer of my letters and accounts which I understand were received at Capo Corso. It would have been a great satisfaction if I could receive your approvall of my accounts, or otherwise what you could object against them. Here is likewise 21 slaves due for building the house which must be paid before I can goe off, having engaged to the blacks before they would undertake to build. Mr Smith has been here and have seen the conveniency of it and is able to give his oppinion of it."
483,1,483,John Winder,Offra,,Cape Coast Castle,23/03/1682,Fort,RAC,"This accompanies Mr John Smith, who will give you an account of all transactions since our departure from Capo Corsoe Castle, and in what condition the Royall Company affaires are at present upon this coast, which for want of goods is soe bad, that I know not how to maintaine myselfe and the rest of the Royall Company servants, finding noe goods in the possession of Mr Wendover (though falsely inform'd he had brought a supply from Capo Corsoe). By the approvall of Mr Smith I came to Ophra, to take account of what goods was in this factory, where I found none but iron and a small parcell of lead, which is soe great a drug that I cannot buy provisions with it but at great loss. Mr Thorne upon my comeing shewed me his accounts to the 18th of December last, copies whereof he advised me were sent to Capo Corsoe. I punctually discharged your commands in acquainting him with your orders for his departure off the coast, he express'd much willingness to be discharged and told me he would goe off in Captain Thomas Woodfine, as required, provided I could pay those Blacks the booges he had been forct to borrow of them for maintenance of the factory, and himselfe his sallery, otherwise he could not gett away, the blacks being resolved to be satisfied before his departure, which having noe effects to doe, must be forc't to continue till the Agent and Councills further order. Mr Thorne hath made up his accounts to the 18th instant, when he delivered the keys of the trunk into my possession, I being detained here by the Phidalgoe, who is very sorry that the Royall Company should have any thoughts of settling at another place, this having been the residence for their people this many years, soe will not lett me leave it, but hopes the Royall Company will alter their resolution and continue their trade with him. My humble advice is that goods may be speedily sent down, with a factor to remaine as second to me, and that both this place and Guidah be continued, the one under the other. By examination I find that Mr Thomas Goulding died about the begining of May last. Mr Thorne being then at Guidah, he declares he knows nothing of his concernes, Mr Cross having taken Mr Gouldings estate into his hands, which was left him as I understand by his last will. Captain John Woodfme is ready to saile, of whome I have demanded bills of loading for his slaves, but he possitively denies to give any, having bought his Negroes himselfe. Captain Thomas Woodfme continues still at Guidah, in great distress for want of goods to purchase his complement of slaves. He hath severall times sent his boat to this place to offer gold for Negroes, the Dutchman have sent him some and promises more, but at a very extravagant rate. I received your letter of the 24th February last per Captain Daniell Gates, who arrived at Guidah the 20th instant, I shall comply with your orders in demanding bills of loading for his slaves, when he hath his complement, and proceed further as your letter directs. If he comes hither I shall doe my utmost endeavour for his dispatch, otherwise I shall be incapable of doeing him any service. Mr Smith has taken charge of the hogshead brandy sent from Capo Corsoe with me, which he will give an account of at his returne. I shall att all times endeavour to promote the interest of my masters, and doe hope that you will think fitt to send downe supplies, that I may have encouragement in their service.

By ballance of the againe said accompt remaines in the factory 236[sic?] slaves in iron Witness my hand
John Thorne"
484,1,484,Arthur Wendover,Apa,,Cape Coast Castle,17/07/1682,Fort,RAC,"You may justly blame me and wonder at my bouldness for goeing to Appa in a canoe that belongs to Captain Wyborne, and also conclued twas on his account and in his service. But I shall endeavour to make you sincible of the contrary, and give you an account of a more honourable a designe than you may or are aware of, and I doubt not may if not neglected prove very advantagious to my masters the Royall Company in whose service I am, and should be heartily glad and as willing as anyone to venture for their advantage my person, as far as my life and health will permitt me, under God etc.
In January last past it was your pleasure to send me Cheife to Guidah on the coast of Arda, and did also deliver me a letter for Mr Ralph Hassell Cheife of Accra, which it seemes was not delivered, upon which neglect your Worship thought fitt to withdraw me, and to that intent did send Mr John Smith, to place Mr John Winder in my stead, and me returne with Mr John Smith to Cape Coast per first oppertunity of the canoe, and also did order me to deliver whatt concernes I had of the Royall Company: which was soone done, for haveing nothing I could deliver nothing, but only 8 damaged barrells of powder which Captain Lawrance left, because Captain Wyborne would not buy them, those they had according to your Honours commands. This hard dealing is enough to breake the hearts of any one, and hath been almost the breaking of mine in this case, and doubt not but your thoughts are as mine, for a burnt child dreads the fire. I humbly beg your pardons, Gentlemen. The letter you are all very sincible that twas particularly about my own business, twas to order Mr Ralph Hassell to take the produce of what goods I had to dispose of there, for account of the Company, and although I did not deliver the letter, neither did I on the other hand take the least thing to the vallue of one cracra, but left all as they were. There is neither Mr Hassell nor Mr Pley, nor any one can say I did, soe that hope this may in part give your Worship some satisfaction. I should not have doubted nor have had any feare in mee but would have gladly delivered the letter, but having a knave to deale with all and the blanketts sticking in Mr Hassells throat, that I could scarce gett a word from him nor a good looke, nor victualls nor drinke, that I did expect no other, butt all the ill usualls imaginable as could be owne to a man, which was the reale cause and is the truth and nothing but the truth (as God shall helpe me). Now being put out of all imployments, and having nothing to doe but walking from place to place and spending my time in idleness, which life was a burthen to me, and being often at Cricry [var. Guidah], for generally there was the most company, always one Commander or another begging of Captain Wyborne his assistance to furnish them with slaves, for goods and gold, whoe always was ready to imbrace their desires with his promises in great measure, and indeed to speake the truth was commonly as good as his word, being there I made a very neare inquiry into all matters; and understanding that there was a place to leward called Appa from whence he gott a great many slaves, some coming by land others by sea, made me admire that men should see their own goods goeing to this place and bring slaves for the produce, when they might as well themselves send their boats and purchase them themselves, for I believe if a canoe may goe a boat may doe the same (I am sure their ships will not faile them), but they doe soe deale on this place Guidah and Ophra that they thinke slaves are not to be hand past [var. below] these places. Then there is another dependence, Captain Wyborne being there they cannot faile, whoe getting their goods into his hands makes his owne advantage, a benda a head the least price for all sorts, men, women, boys and girles. That men of reason and of understanding should see themselves soe bubled, I am sure tis much to the disadvantage of the Royall Company and owners, I shall instance in several particulars by and by.
Seeing how causes went and nothing to do, I desired the favour of Captain Wyborne that I might goe to Appa per the next canoe, which he readily granted mee, telling me the canoe would returne in 10 days, which time I thought would not be long, and knowing that Mr Smith would not goe this month, I did adventure at which place I am now, of which I shall give you the following account and the great advantage that may be made on all accounts whatsoever. Appa is about 30 or 40 leagues at the most from Guidah and is very remarkable for ships to find, there being a single cocarnutt tree standing in the middle of a small bay, and a flag staff by that one [= on] which they hang up an old clout, itt makes off to sea very woody for it is a woody place, but I shall advise the Phidalgoe to make a new St Georges flagg. The Phidalgoes towne is about 3 miles from the sea, which is incompassed round with water and small riverlett issuing from the great river, and is mightily full of ba[m]boo trees which afford wine much like unto palme wyne, of which baboos they build all their houses. There is also a very famous river that goes to Boneen, from whence comes all sorts of cloathes and are sold cheap for any sorts of goods. Boneen is 2 dayes journey from this place per land, all goods that comes to this place are conveyed to the Phidalgoes towne by water, they having canoes of 40, 50 and 60 foot in length. There is noe need of anyones taking care of goods when ashoare as to watch them, for the people are so just that they may be trusted with unsold gold, their honesty is to admiration, and the Phidalgoe takes all the care upon himselfe. Here is good conveniency of wooding and watering just by the seaside. These people never goe to sea in their canoes, for the river being soe large and affording very much fish as mullitts and there is one sort of fish that is large as a good handsome hoge, eats much like our sturgeon and is as good in my judgement, for that if any vessell intends for this place they must be provided with a canoe and men, which said canoe may returne fraighted with Boneen cloathes (and other sorts as the place can afford, which may be much to the advantage of the Royall Company my masters. It is also the chiefest markett for slaves (or the fairo as the blacks call it), from whence the people of Guidah and Ophra are furnisht. Assinah voulgarly called Ardau Grandy and other ajacent places from whence comes most slaves are ajacent to this place, soe that slaves cannot be wanting and are not, and to be bought for a more reasonable rate then either at Guidah or Ophra; of rates shall give you an account how I have seen them bought. The Phidalgoe is very desirous of a trade and also the people. Once in 15 or 20 days you shall see the river full of canoes and like unto the River of Thames, some with slaves others with clouts, others with sheap, goats, henns, others with corne etc.
The Phidalgoe is a very good man, and lives in great splendour and much honoured by all his people   your trade is wholly with him and noe man elce, he takeing charge of all, soe the trouble is but small.
The Cappusheers are a very good honest people, very laborious alwayes, and for the Phidalgoe or else themselves, their business is cheifely in building, which they doe very famously and very large houses, and as for the common people they seldome or never trouble you, for they come not within the Kings Court, but they are generally honest, which thing is a rarity amongst them: tis not soe at Guidah, them knaves are alwayes stealing and bringing troublesome palavoras to their King, which is not here. Goods bringing from the Appraye very reasonably with abundance of care, and delivered safe into your house. As for the base exacting of custome as the King of Guidah doth demand, I doe not as yett understand that they desire any, and I shall not make enquiry for feare of putting them in mind of such an evill habuit, but I doe believe the Phidalgoe doth expect something, and also the Cabbisheers, which will not be much. I can assure your Worship this that slaves are not wanting at this place, and could the Phidalgoe have any encouragement and his people they would make it their business to turne the trade. Also the people of Assimah or Uper Arda and severall neighbouring Phidalgoes have been with me, and beg heartily that ships may come, for it is soe far for them to go to Guidah, and likewise they run the hazard of being panjard and robed of their goods and slaves (which are all very good reasons in my opinion). And as for the injuries done to the Royall Company, I shall instance in these particulars; Captain Thomas Woodfme, Commander of the Sarah Bonadventure, sold the 3 peices of scarlett cloath to Captain Wyborne for 9 slaves, and also 3 pieces perpettuanoes and 1 piece of say for one, which 3 pieces of scarlett cloath I saw sold for 22 by one Cocarham, a person that belongs to Captain Wyborne, and his [= is] brother to Hansco, a very honest fellow, and very willingly would be imployed in the Companys serice; and also Captain John [Woodfine] of the John Bonadventure and Daniell Gates, Commander of the Allapeen, sold sundry pieces of silks to Captain Wyborne, they being somewhat damaged, which the other person sold as followeth, 1 piece of yellow sarcinett slite and damaged containing 48 yards  for 5 slaves, one piece of green very slite containing 37 yards  for 4, one piece of pinke colour and 1 piece cherry containing 37 yards for 5, one piece of skie sarcinett slite but a pleasant colour and good containing 39 yards  for 5, 1 piece of flowered colour and good containing 13[] yards for 2 slaves  which goods at Guidah where blowne upon and slited as if they had cost nothing, nay upon the scarlett cloath the King spit upon it, for noe booges noe slaves, without you will pay the twice the worth of them in other goods. Tis otherwise here, for anything goes off, booges not coveted, but good rich silkes, and all sorts of linnins, noe one sort excepted as I know of unless it be iron barrs, and they shall not stick ahand, neither any other thing rather then not trade, the people are soe willing.
And having now made you sincible of my goeing to Appa and upon what account, which was noe other then to see what manner of place it was and what sort of people, also if that the place were a place for trade or not, which were my cheiefe intentions, and noe other ends in the least but to make the strictest enquiry as possibly I could, that I might be capable of giveing account of a place that may soe much to the advantage of the Royall Company, which is the truth (as God will help me), having given this account I shall leave it to your wise and prudent considerations and shall remaine here untill your further answer and make what inspection possible I can into the trade; and accordingly shall act and doe as you advice.
[PS] I must acquaint your worship that I have had two tedious fitts of sickness since I have been here, which have much weakened me, but I thank God am very well recovered, and in a good way to gaine my strength againe. The Phidalgoe was my docter, for every day he makes me one thing or another to take, but what it was I can never tell, also water to gargal in my mouth, and would alwayes see me take them before he would goe. In perusall of yours by Mr John Smith I understand that Mr Ralph Hassell should say that the oath which I did take upon the account of the blanketts that I was forced to doe the same, but I must be so bold with him as to tell him that he is a base knave and a most horrible notorious lyer, for all the time that I was at Accra last I scarce changed one word with him, for he would not speake to me. And likewise Mr Pley doth confirme the same, he knowes to the contrary, but I pitty him, he dirst doe noe other wayes. For Mr Hassells part tis like him, tis the real effects of his heart and minds, also his maxims of advice to all to deny itt and confirme it with oaths, but I would have Mr Hassell to know that I understand my selfe better then to be made a knight of the past, or to be forced to sweare upon any account whatsoever. He may sweare by the eternall God if that he pleaseth, he never bought any blanketts from Captain John How, and Mr Pley may also sweare he never had them in possession. According to the the oath that I did take, which I did voluntarily, I say that Ralph Hassell Chiefe of Accra did buy from Captain John How 102 blanketts att 3a per blankett, whoe lay at anchor off Lague, this was the 2nd day of October ([16]81), and brought them ashoare and put them into the warehouse in Accra fort; which is truth as God shall help and the whole truth etc. Being at anchor at Wyamba Captain John How came aboard Captain Thomas Woodfme and saluted me per the salutation of informer, for Mr Hassell had acquainted him how squares had gone; and I suppose delivered the blanketts back againe, for he told me that he was fully satisfied.
Accounts of the rates I have seen paid for slaves at this place Appa
Silks, 1 piece yellow, damaged, containing 48 yards  for 5 slaves; 1 piece greene containing 37 yards for 4 slaves; 1 piece of pink and 1 piece cherry, damaged, containing 37 yards for 4 slaves; 1 piece of good slite skye containing 39 yards  for 5 slaves; one piece flowred ditto, good, containing 13 yards  for 2 slaves.
All sorts of silks sell well here, especially those that are very rich and gaudy. Sundry other sorts of goods vizt apiece of fine Scarlett cloth, 7 slaves; 12 iron barrs, 1 ditto; 3 cases of spiritts, 1 ditto; 2 red perpettuanos 1 ditto; 3 fine India carpetts, ditto; 6 narrow pintadoes, ditto; 4 silke allejars ditto; 12 small baftas, ditto; 4 chints, ditto. These goods I have seen bartered for slaves per Cockro and for the rates above mentioned, butt for the rates of others I cannot tell as yett, but doe presume to be all one, nay and rather cheaper, for good goods they covett much, gaudy and rich, although anything is vendible here, rather than want a trade the people are so desireous. I doe believe that Welch plaines would sell well here, by reason they make all their rich cloathes of them, soe that care must be had to the severall sorts of colours, red, green, yellow, blew, purple and orange, and the Phidalgoe gave me a cloath made of Welch plaine which is very handsome.
[PPS] I had neither inke nor paper but only this one sheet per chance, and am forced to write with gunpowder steeped in water, soe desire to be excused for this foule page[?].
At the request of the Phidalgoe he desires me to write for the severall particulars as followeth  fine linnins of all sorts, as fine sletias, fine muslings, also beads of all sorts, small and great. I saw sold an head of beads of an gold color, transparent, large the size of a white pea, this bought 1 slave. With beads, the small ones, they adorn their cloaths and make capps in the shape of a sugar loaf and adorne them as thicke as possibly they can in sundry pretty formes, which show very glorious. Your atlas silke are desired, also booges, which doe encourage much."
485,1,485,Andrew Crosbie,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,01/09/1682,Fort,RAC,"Whereas Mr John Winder, your honours cheife factor for this coast, was upon the 15th of this instant September panyard by the Blacks in order to his being sent home in the ship Thomas and William, the reasons whereof shall in short give your honours and thereby endeavour to cleare myself of those aspertions hee already has or may further cast upon mee.
Firstly: Att his first comeing here from Ophra to this place, not well considering the interest of your Honours in studying and consulting the humours and dispositions of these people, whoe will neither be slighted by a high and lofty carridge or abused by bad language, in both of which gave too much liberty to his selfe, by which hee hath for ever lost the love and good will of these people, although the breach for the present be seemingly made up, there being not one upon the place from the King to the poorest can afford or give him a good word.
2ndly: By his becomeing debtor to one Captaine Bebe for 15 slaves which was a long time before paid and then not to his [= Bebe's] satisfaction, I doe presume might be a great part (and by the disgust the blacks had before taken against him) of his being panyard, and for whatt hee may possibly say of my selfe being concerned therein, itt was soe fair from mee that when heard itt [I] did endeavour and partly effected the composeing of the business, and now must give your Honours an accompt of his suspistious asperscons cast upon mee. For some time past your honours factory here lead voy'd, in which time did give the utmost of my assistance to all masters of ships in your Honours service, by which meanes was gratified by one and the other to the vallue of 7 or 8 bendy's, possibly more, 7 whereof lent to Mr Winder, for which received his noate to be paid mee againe, but some time after when hee had my money in possession told mee hee had seazed itt for your Honours account, which seemed more then unkind, of which doe leave your honours judge. Seeing hee was like to leave the place [I] did tell him if might have my monyes [I] would trye and endeavour to compose his business, which did endeavour and partly by my meanes itt was effected, and to what other callamnys hee may loade mee with, as seeing interlopers and the like, I doe here declare the contrary, but can bring with good proofe the same thing upon himselfe, which hereunder in short shall give your Honours an account of in three articles.
1st. Upon the 14th day of August past, here being in port an interloper called [blank], one Fullwood Commander, whoe wanting some assistance, Captain Wyborne not being here, Mr Winder did him what kindness lay in his power, by first of all in paying his customes to the King, which was paid out of your Honours warehouse in 9 lb of boogees and 9 yards of silke, which contracted the familliarity betwixt them (things not here going to his satisfaction), that hee agreed to put 40 slaves on board of him and soe leave your honours factory here, 8 of which was put on board, in which time Captain North came in hither with some goods for your honours account [and] the business was made up and declined.
2ndly. Captain Shepheard here leaveing some few remaines of booges, the said Mr Winder caused them to be carryed to Captain Wyborns to serve and for the use of interlopers.
3rdly. Upon the 17th instant I doe know and can attest hee served and supplyed a Portugueze vessell with 6 slaves, notwithstanding your honours ship in port, which is all att present I shall trouble your honours with, notwithstanding could attest and averr severall things more."
486,1,486,Andrew Crosbie,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,01/09/1682,Fort,RAC,"I humbly presume to offer to your serious view and judgements the foregoing copie sent to the Company by Captain North, as well for my owne justification as for endeavouring the prevention of the mine of the interest of their honours here in this place by Mr Winder, whoe never from the first day hee came hither tooke the right way or course to preserve itt, by his alwayes quarrelling and not agreeing with the natives here, since which hee hath acted many more ill things to the prejudice of the Company, as Mr Armitage if hee please can testify of, as enticeing away Captain Norths man, not to serve the Companys interest but his owne, for that Mr Winder tould me that expected a New England man here and did designe to put on board some slaves of her and send him along with them. And then his carrying out the Companys goods in the night to Captain Wybornes house, trucking of them away for gold and cloaths to the mine and prejudice of the trade here by selling att and under rate, only for to gett gold to have carryed him off, with many more ill things of the like nature, and for whatsoever hee may impeach mee of I durst refer myselfe to your Worship or any person here that is concern'd in the Companys service. The grounds of his disgust and hatred your Worship may perceive by mine to the Company. Not else, but as have soe shall still faithfully endeavour the full discharging of my duty, and the obeying in all things Mr Armitages commands."
487,1,487,Timothy Armitage,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,24/10/1682,Fort,RAC,"In my last bearing date the 26th past per Captain North gave your Honours an account of the then present needfull, and did hope by this conveyance might have given your Honours a satisfactory account of the well settlement of this your factory, which doe now find will never be effected as long as Mr Winder tarry's upon this place, his humour not suiting with the nature and disposition of the blacks here, whoe has noe love or kindness in the least for him. They have since my last to your Honours endeavoured a second time sending him off, by pigniaring of him with a possitive resolution that hee shall not remaine upon this place. The reasons of their disgust against him I have endeavoured as nigh as possible to gather from them, which goes here inclosed, the most part of which I must assert the verrity thereof, as can likewise Captain Ambrose and Mr Thomson, both whome as well as myselfe have endeavoured to secure your honours interest by counselling of him upon a consultation together held the 21st instant to cause those goods that were carried down to Captain Wybornes in the night time out of your honours warehouse to be brought up againe, and to apply himselfe to the Agent and Councill at Cabo Corsoe, by takeing the oppertunity of a canoe now going thither, to both which he would not agree nor assent, but has and does endeavour to convert the said goods into gold to your honours prejudice, pretending your honours are more indebted to him, as your honours may perceive by the inclosed account, which hee gave mee to send home to your honours when [he] thought to have gott his passage upon one of these two ships now in port, vizt the Goulden Fortune and the George. I have as bounden drawne up some objections against his said account, which together goes here inclosed for your Honours better government. I am sorry should have soe just occasion and soe bad a subject to enlarge upon, and soe soone contradict my last, but shall as soone as may be dispatch away the canoe to the Agent and Councill, whose further orders shall here attend; and shall per Captain Ware give your honours a more full account.
[Inclosure 1]
Hereunder follow the reasons of the disgust the Blacks has taken against Mr Winder, vizt.
1st. When he first came to settle amongst them his bad language and carriage suited not their humours, which occasioned a small breach.
2ndly. Upon which he left their towne and the Companys factory and tooke up his aboade for some time att Captain Wybornes house, whome they knew was not concern'd in the Companys business, which created in them a great dislike to him, they being naturally covetous of trade.
3rdly. His endeavouring to gett into their debts, and actually running into one Captain Bibbees debts, when afterward they understood hee did it with a designe to goe off with one Fullwood, an interloper then in port, to which end hee had actually put aboard 8, and laid under an obligation to make itt up 40 slaves. 4thly. His cutting of sletias and lessening the bunches of beads, which they looke upon as an absolute cheate to their country.
5thly. His carrying of goods out of the factory in the night time to the Lower Towne and to Captain Wyborne's house, which soe far as I can perceive have been the cause that have soe much insenced them against him.

489,1,489,Timothy Armitage,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,28/10/1682,Fort,RAC,"My last was under date of the 27th past, copie whereof must here omitt in regard of the shortness of time that at present offers, occasioned by a great differance betwixt Mr Winder and the Blacks here, as your Worship may perceive by the above copie and inclosed sent home to the Company by Captain Ambrose, there being no reconciling of itt; since which hee has delivered what goods remaining in the warehouse (although very inconsiderable) into my custody, which shall be disposed of to the most advantage of the Royall Company, an account whereof goes here inclosed. Hee would willingly have gon off in Captain Ambrose or Captain Ware, but neither of them would receive him, itt being our generall advice that hee should apply himself to your Worship and Councill, causing the goods hee carried out of the factory in the night time to be brought in againe, which hee will not be perswaded to, but supose hee will take the next oppertunity to goe off. Shall endeavour as much as in mee ly's to maintaine the Companys honour and interest, although hee has left mee very little to doe it with, as your Worship will perceive, and in goods that will not readily vend. This comes via St Thoma per Captain Ware, whoe has this day gott his complement of Negroes aboard if not more, haveing left behinde him only 21 iron barrs in the factory. I have obeyed your Worships order in requiring bills of loading from them, but itt is refus'd by all. To prevent the Companys goods from being made use of I doe humbly offer my opinion that your Worship send down copie of their invoyces of what goods aboard of them for the purchaseing their complement of Negro's, by which shall be able to make some computation; for that if they have any remains they will rather sell them for gold then leave them in the factory for the Companys use, as Mr Bathurst in Captain North did, whoe sold upwards of 500weight of booges, cutt the Companys sletias, sold severall remnants amounting to 11 peeces to Mr Winder, whoe will not denie itt, by which the trade is almost ruin'd. In 2 or 3 days hope shall dispatch the canoe, by which shall give your Worship a more large account how things goe here. In the meanetime humbly crave further orders for the settleing of this place, which in time may prove a place of as great consequence as any place upon the coast of Guyney. Doe likewise crave positive orders for the putting of any slaves aboard any ship or ships, and the quantity."
490,1,490,Timothy Armitage,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,05/12/1682,Fort,RAC,"Inclosed goes copie of my last via St Thoma per Captain Ware, who departed this place thee 3rd instant, although had all his Negro's aboard the 28th past and upon thee same day took his leave of this our towne, although tarryed below att Captain Wybornes severall day's, which with his leaving behind but 21 iron barrs in the factory creates the suspition in mee of his haveing many more slaves aboard then his complement, for that Mr Thomson whoe acted and did all the business in the buying the slaves, upon the 28th instant told mee that then they had their full complement, when that I was assured hee had not disposed of in silke more then 2 slaves, and what became of the rest I leave your Worship to judge, as likewise a parcell of corrall and some muzlins which were not here disposed of. As not seeing their invoyces could not make any computation, but tooke notice of what goods they had, an account whereof goes here inclosed, with their prize how disposed of, by which your Worship may see whether they have done the Company right or not. I doe not remember that did see any other sorts of goods but what is here specified. The wrong Mr Bathurst did the Company in selling their booges for gold, cutting their sletias, have in mine of the 28th October past given your Worship an account of, copie whereof goes here inclosed, as likewise copie of last to England with Mr Winders account etc., whoe (although much against his will, haveing endeavoured his passage upon all ships that has bin her, as well interlopers as Companys ships) comes in the canoe, whome I safely wish with your Worship. What goods he tooke out of the factory in the night time hee has disposed them the major part for gold, and the rest for cloaths, with an intention to have seen England before Cabo Corsoe, although now prevented. I must needs acquaint your Worship that many day's before I arrived here in Captain North that hee had contracted with one Fullwood, an interloper, to have put aboard 40 slaves, and to have went with them himselfe to Barbado's, whereof I am sencible that 8 of them was actually put aboard. Together with Mr Winder comes one Daniell Roe whoe left and ran away from Captain North, whome Mr Winder has entertained ever since; his designe in itt (I am inform'd, if things here went according to his expectation) was in some short time to have sent him away with slaves for New England in a New England man hee expected downe here, of which as bounden thought myselfe obliged to give your Worship an account, leaving the sequell of all things to your Worships prudence. I have likewise sent you up in the canoe one Patrick Welch, whome I understand ran away from the Castle to the prejudice of the Companys interest, hee was brought hither by one Wood, an interloper, and putt aboard of one Wilcocks now in port, whoe turned him here ashoare upon some differance happening.I did hope, as your Worship may perceive by the inclosed copies, might have sent you up the canoe before this, but that the canoemen did evade itt by the non properness of the season of the yeare, with the like excuses, and have been forced to furnishe them in order to their dispatches as att bottom, of which your Worship may please to take noate. I now question not in the least, but that the Companys affaires here will be in a mighty good posture and condition, and hope towards the maintaining of which your Worship will consider a fresh supply, Mr Winder haveing left nothing behind him that will att present purchase victualls, allthough have and shall ever endeavour the maintaining the Companys, their rights, honour and privilidge here, and the true discharging of those bonds and obligations under which I lay, which hope time may veryfie. As to the removing Captain Wyborne in complyance to your order, I see not how myselfe or any other in the Companys service can effect it, soe long as the Companys ships doe maintaine and uphold him and supply him with guns, all sorts of ammunition, with other materialls, as Captain Ware has latly don. I have wrote to Mr Thorne severall times but as yett can gett noe account from him of what number of barrs remaine in the factory, although hee writes mee word is willing to goe off and shall, if can gett leave of the King, send Andrew Crosbie thither to take an account and endeavour their disposall for the Companys use. What goods most in demand your Worship will find att foot hereof, for which goods slaves can never be wanting, although there should come downe never soe many ships, and question not but in a verry short time this place may prove of verry great importance to the Company. And if they should altogether quitt Ophra, this place is sufficient for to slave all their ships, for that they doe and must send their slaves from Ophra hither, and that if your Worship and Councill thought itt convenient and approved thereof here might be alway's in bank 100 slaves to supply upon any occasion any of the Companys ships according to your order and directions, which presume your Worship will find itt in time much to the Companys interest.
[PS] May itt please your Worship, there is great occasion of brandy here in the factory.

491,1,491,Petley Wyburne,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,08/12/1682,Fort,RAC,"I received a letter from your Honour and Councill dated the 12th of September. As for Captain Parris leaveing me heare, itt was because I would not goe further with him. For the Royall Companys service, I respect itt as I ought to doe. I have had a letter by Captain Price from my brother Wyborne, in which I understand the Company hath spoke to him to write to mee to serve them and that hee is intreating them about my former losses, of which I expect to heare farther by the first and then shall be able to give you a better satisfaction. However my concerns are too greate here to leave this place untill I goe off the coast. If your honour and Councill think mee fitt to serve the Company here or att Ophra and allow mee assistance, I will endeavour to sett theire affairs in a right posture and render a just accompt, or if you doe not think fitt to intrust mee if you are pleased to send an honest ingenious man that will heare my advice, I will be as faithfull to him as I would be to my brother, and be as just to the Companys interest as if I received their pay. I beseech you be pleased to beleeve me, as I am upon my owne account here soe I doe all that I can for the good of trade, and if I doe well for my selfe I must doe well for the Company. For your being my enemies itt would trouble mee verry much if I deserved itt, but if itt be as I am to the Companys interest I shall be thankfull to you, for I am sure I have done them more true service then hath been don to them since I came here by all their servants besides. It would not become mee to wright the least ill of any of the Companys servants, but to see their trade and our country's creditt, that mought be soe great here, abused by home mad, brandy mad, boy mad, treacherous and foole mad men, hath made mee ashamed and troubled sometimes  treacherous by bribing the blacks to quarrell with their fellow servants and turne them out to gett themselves into their places, by insnareing one another into ill actions and then wrighting against them, by informing the blacks of the vallue of goods against their masters and all other peoples interest that trades. Here is one Crosbie, whoe the people would have sent away from this country severall times before Mr Winder came downe, but I would not suffer them, and since by his informing the blacks of what your factors or masters of ships doe or say, and alsoe informing in trade, that hee is in such favour that Mr Winder told mee that he would verry willingly have him up to Capo Corsoe with him, but hee beleeved the people would not let him goe. Mr Armitage pretends that hee desires verry much that hee could send him, but when I had spoke to the Blacks and they had consented if Mr Armitage and Mr Winder would desire itt, Mr Armitage then told Mr Winder that hee could not send him yett, but hee would in a short time. I doe verryly beleeve Mr Armitage had rather Mr Winder had run off from the coast then to Cabo Corsoe, this fellow was verry help full in getting Mr Winder out of his place. Pray beleeve I had rather see the Companys interest goe forward then any other nation."
492,1,492,John Thorne,Offra,,Cape Coast Castle,28/01/1683,Fort,RAC,"February the 12th 1681/2 Mr John Winder in the night came to Ophra and the next morning showed me your Worships order, the which I most willingly complyed with, and he forthwith desired that the Phidalgoe might have notice of it, that your Worship and Gentlemen of the Councill had thought fitt to make him Chiefe factor on the Coast of Arda, and [he] desir'd he might have his residence here at Ophra and to be secured, otherwise Mr John Smith would have him to Guidah, he [= Smith] being the only man he was to suspect, as haveing notice of it before from Mr Spurvay. A letter of the 14th came to Mr John Winder from the said Mr John Smith to desire Mr Winder to looke after the debts which is owing to the Royall Company, unto whome I gave a particular account of all. The 22nd came another letter from Mr John Smith to Mr Winder intemating that Captain Thomas Woodfine had altered his mind and was resolved to take in his complement of slaves at Guidah, and wished Mr Winder to neglect noe time but come away as soon as possible might be. Mr Winder having received this letter makes all the meanes that might be to the Phidalgoe, telling him that Mr Smith had sent for him to Guidah with an intent to withdraw this factory, and therefore desired he might be protected by him, which being granted by the Phidalgoe Mr Winder then writes to Mr Smith that he was retain'd by the Phidalgoe and could not possibly come to Guidah. Mr Smith sent severall letters to him to come to Guidah and at last came himself, but was forced to goe back without him. I asked the reason of his being soe unwilling to goe with Mr Smith, he told me Mr Smith had a mind to keepe him at Guidah and come to settle here himselfe, and that he had received severall abuses by whitemen att Guidah and held it not a place fitt for a factory, in regard they had soe raised the prices of slaves to 25 per cent dearer then they are at Ophra. Mr Smith not satisffied with Mr Winders staying at Ophra, thinking the Phidalgoe had kept him by force contrary to his owne will, was resolved to fetch him away in the night, the which resolution he put into practice and came to Ophra in the night with a spare hammack and men arm'd, and being without sent Francis Capell to the factory to acquaint Mr Winder with his designe, and desired Mr Winder to come to him with all speed. Mr Winder haveing received this message went along with Francis Capell to Mr Smith, and as he went acquainted some of the Phidalgoes people which lay at the gate (as they doe every night) that Mr Smith was come to fetch him to Guidah. This notice being given the towne was soone up in arms, which Mr Smith found to his cost, and seeing he could not gett Mr Winder away return'd to Guidah againe and began to make preparation to goe to Cape Coast, which after some time proceeded on his voyage. He being gone Captain Shepheard arrived about the 20th of June in Guidah Road, and goeing on shoare there was forc't to send for his goods, for the Blacks would not suffer him to goe on board againe before he had began to trade with them. Captain Shepheard then sent Mr Winder your Worships letters, which haveing received [Winder] sent Robert Chapman in a canoe on board to desire Captain Shepheard to bring his ship into Ophra road, where he would be ready to doe him all the service he could as per order from your Worship, but where he was he could not assist him in any thing, besides if he could come might do the Royall Company great service in it, for here was 30 slaves owing to the Company which would be shipt on board him, or if his goods should fall short might be made good by iron barrs, which with his other goods would be put off and not otherwise, but Captain Shepheard being on shoare before Mr Winders letters came could not comply with his desires, but writt him a letter and sent it by Robert Chapman who was then on board that in regard he could not comply with what Mr Winder had write him of, nevertheless he would send him his remaines to Ophra if he would send the said Robert Chapman for them, and withall order him to give a receipt for what he received, and it would be as well as if he had did it himselfe. Mr Winder haveing received Captain Shepheards letter was willing to goe on board of him, and desired me to speake to the Phidalgoe for him, but when the Phidalgoe heard he would goe on board a ship in Guidah road began to be doubtfull of his returne and refer'd his answer till another time, but Mr Winder being urgent with the Phidalgoe made him the more distrustfull of his comeing againe, which I told Mr Winder of but he told me that if I could gett leave of the Phidalgoe for him, he would become bound to me in a 200 pound bond, and likewise would give the Phidalgoe 60 slaves, that is the 30 that he owes the Royall Company and 30 more in iron, if he returned not againe but went on shoare at Guidah. On these considerations the Phidalgoe granted leave with my engagement together. He went on board and haveing been on board 2 dayes but the King of Guidah heard of it, and told Captain Shepheard if he would bring him on shoare he would give him a slave for his paines, the which Captain Shepheard soone put into practice and gott him on shoare, to the great loss of the Royall Company, for as soone as this Phidalgoe heard of it he sent for his 30 slaves in iron, which I kept him from for severall months and told him did believe Mr Winder would come againe, and had kept them yet in the factory had not Mr Armitage sold 500 bars to the French Merchant and he comeing to demand them the Phidalgoe said he would be paid first the 30 slaves due to him which Mr Winder contracted, and soe forc't me to pay the 30 slaves in iron. He being paid I refused to give the French Merchant the barrs Mr Armitage had sold him till further order from your Worship. I often desired Mr Winder to take some care for my departure from this place but he put me of from time to time, and told me would waite your Worships further order, he not finding me guilty of any thing of what was laid to my charge. The letter that came to your Worship in Andrew Crosbies name is false, he denyes it and saith he never writ any. Mr Smith and Mr Winder both questioned him about it and had his answer. When Mr Winder was gott to Guidah I often moved my willingness to be discharged and to goe home according to your Worships order. I also desired him to take some care to send booges downe to maintaine the factory, [he] have[ing] then soe many in his hands, and not let the Companys barrs be sold at soe pitifull a price as 3 lbs of booges per barr, but neither Mr Winder nor Mr Armitage would give me any answeare to what I writt, though severall desired, and might have had my passage in a Dutch ship if it had not been both theire neglects. I have been ever willing your Worships orders should be obeyed in things soe far as ever I was capable, for I hold it as great a crime to disobey lawfull authority as to take part in any unlawfull authority. My humble request to take some consideration of this place, either by sending some releife or by other meanes to withdraw it. If it be your Worships pleasure to withdraw it, send but some goods that is vendible here to put of this iron and you may have the slaves sent to Guidah or elsewhere.
I have sent your Worship the coppy of Mr Winders contracts made to the Phidalgoe and my selfe.
[Inclosure]
A copy of the contract Mr John Winder made the Phidalgoe of Ophra:
On consideration that the Phidalgoe hath promised me to goe on board Captain Richard Sheppards ship the St George, I doe promise not to goe on shoare at Guidah, but after some small stay on board the ship to return againe to Ophra; and if I shall act any thing contrary to my promise, doe hereby oblige myselfe to the said Phidalgoe in the debt of 30 slaves, and doe give him free liberty to take the same in iron if I shall faile to returne, in witness whereof have hereunto sett my hand dated this 27th day of June (1682).
The copy of Mr John Winders condition made to me [John Thorne] The condition of this obligation is such that whereas the above said John Thorne shall upon the special request and intreaty of the above bounden John Winder use all his endeavour to prevaile with the Phidalgoe of Ophra to permitt the said John Winder to goe aboard the St George in the road of Guidah upon the said Coast of Arda, whereof is Commander under God Richard Shepheard, and hath engaged his estate to the said Phidalgoe that the said John Winder shall returne to Ophra and not goe on shoare at Guidah aforesaid, that then this present obligation to be void and of noe effect, or else to stand and be in full force and vertue."
493,1,493,John Winder,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,15/03/1683,Fort,RAC,"Whereas John Thorne in his letter of the 28th January last accuseth me of the following misdemeanours:
lstly. That upon my arrivall at Ophra the 12th day of Febuary 1681/2 I desired the Phidalgoe that I might reside in his country and that he would protect me from Mr Smith, whome I pretended was my enemy and would have me to Guidah; of which (he saith) I had advice before from Mr Spurvay
2ndly. That I received a letter from Mr John Smith the 22nd following wherein I was desired by him, to make all possible hast to Guidah, did acquaint the Phidalgoe that Mr Smith had sent for me with an intent to withdraw the factory from Ophra, and that I againe desir'd his protection, which being granted, he saith I wrote to Mr Smith that I was detained by the Phidalgoe and could not possibly come to Guidah. 3rdly. Being demanded by the said John Thorne, why I was so unwilling to goe with Mr Smith when return'd to Guidah from Ophra, I answered Mr Smith had a mind to keepe me at Guidah, and come to settle at Ophra himselfe, that I had received severall abuses from whitemen at Guidah and that I thought it not a place fitt for a factory, in regard the prices of slaves was exhaurted to 25 per cent more then at Ophra.
4thly. That Mr Smith came to Ophra in the night with a spare hammack, and being without sent Francis Capell to the factory, acquainting me with his designe and desireing me to come to him, which (he saith) I did, and as I went acquainted some of the Phidalgoes people therewith, whereupon the towne was up in arms and Mr Smith forct to goe without me.
5thly. That Captain Richard Shepheard being arrived at Guidah I desired John Thome to speake to the Phidalgoe to lett me goe on board him, but he being doubtfull of my returne was unwilling to lett me goe, upon which he saith I proffered him a bond of 100, and another to the Phidalgoe of 60 slaves to be forfeited if I did not returne, upon which consideration leave was granted to me.
6thly. That the said John Thorne did often solicite me to take care for his departure from Ophra and that I would send him booges to maintaine the factory, and not lett the Companys barrs be sold at soe pittifull a price as 3 pound of booges, to which (he saith) I never returned him an answer
To which particulars I returne these answers:
To the 1st. I acknowledge I arrived at Ophra around the time John Thorne mentions, but that I had any intention to reside there I utterly deny; neither did I ever request the Phidalgoe to protect me from Mr Smith, having no other intention but to returne to Guidah as soone as I had completed my business, and acquainted the Phidalgoe with the Agent Generalls and Councills instructions; and as to what he saith that I had notice from Mr Spurvay of Mr Smiths ill intentions towards me, I call God to wittness I never received any letter from him in my life; neither doe I remember I ever soe much as mentioned his name to John Thorne.
To the 2nd. I acknowledge that I wrote to Mr Smith in answer to his of 22nd February that the Phidalgoe did detaine me, and that I had soe great a watch over me that I could not possibly make my escape, but that it was my owne contrivance, I againe call God to wittness, tis a most notorious lye, and I hope not to be credited; since Thorne doth attest in the 5th article, that I went on shoare at Guidah, and forfeited bonds I had given for my returne.
To the 3rd. I acknowledge I did often say that I thought Ophra more convenient for the Companys factory then Guidah, by reason of the cheapness of carrying goods to the factory from the waterside was not soe great, and that slaves were to be had there at a far lower rate. As to what he saith that I told him of Mr Smiths designe to keep me at Guidah and settle himself at Ophra, I doe attest that the said John Thorne did endeavour to perswade me Mr Smith had such a designe, which I never credited, knowing he did it on purpose, to alienate my affections from the said Mr Smith.
To the 4th. I can safely take my corporall oath, that when I went out of the factory to Mr Smith, I did it with as real a designe to make my escape with him to Guidah as ever I did any thing in my life, and might have gon away had not Thorne sent the Blacks to panyare us.
To the 5th. I acknowledge it true, and that I did give a bond of 100 to John Thorne and of 30 Slaves to the Phidalgoe for my returne to Ophra, without which I could not possibly escape, and here I desire John Thornes roguery may be taken notice of, for if he had noe designe to prevent my goeing away, why did he make me give him a bond to assure him of my returne.
To the 6th. I confess I never sent John Thorne any booges, it being contrary to my orders to send any goods or any person there till he was gon off."
494,1,494,John Winder,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,24/06/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your severall letters of the 17th and 19th of Aprill, with those of the 10th and 12th of May, lyes now before mee, haveing in pursuance to your orders therein specified, don my utmost endeavour for the dispatch of the Royall Companys ships that are lately gon from hence, and should have ere now dispatcht the canoe with advice had the weather been a little more favourable, but the canoemen have been forct to stay some time to repaire the canoe, much damag'd by her often oversetting in these boysterous seas. I am most heartily sorry I am forct to give you account of the unhappy misfortune befallen the Royall Company by Captain Lowe and Woollifords ships being taken, as also per the loss of the Blessing. I shall forbeare to trouble you with every particular circumstance hereof, because itt is largely express'd in the inclosed from Captain Lowe to the Agent, and only acquaint you in the generall that the 16th ultimo in the evening the two pyrates mentioned in your letter of the 12th ditto came downe to this roade, and tooke Captain Lowe, whoe made some small resistance. Captain Rickards people cutt their cable and went out of the roade, but before the ship came ashoare tooke the gold out and left her, which [ship] is lost, and not anything saved out of her. The mens intent was to run away with the gold, in order whereunto they gott aboard the Dutchmen in Ophra roade, but by the endeavour of Captain Rickard and myselfe and some small matter given the Phidalgoe for his assistance (whoe I must needs say was verry helpfull to us) part of itt is recovered, and one bulse containing 28 marks, 3 ounces and 7 angles sent the Royall Company by Captain Woolliford. The rest Captain Rickards has carried with him in the Merchants Bonadventure, whoe departed this roade 5 dayes since. Captain Woollifords men left the ship, which the pyrates tooke the next morning with all the gold in her, they pretended they would have fought but that 12 of their guns were in the hould, which was the occasion of their flight. Perhaps itt may be immagined that itt was my fault hee was not gon off with his complement before, but I call God to wittness I did my utmost endeavour, as Captain Lowe and Rickard will justifie to the Royall Company, and doe affirme that would hee have been ruled by mee hee might have been dispatcht. Att my arrivall with him, I found the trade much altered in my absence, the people craveing to have the measure for booges altered, and the price of slaves in many goods to be advanc'd, which I refused to doe, itt being your express order to depress the price, and not to advance itt, by which meanes I bought but 50 slaves in 3 weekes, but when I had brought the people to their former customes and they were content to sell their slaves att the old rate, Captain Woolliford came ashoare, and in a great passion tooke the business out of my hands and immediatly chang'd the measure and brought up a custome of shakeing itt, whereby itt is become neare 90 pounds, and farther gave 3 fine sletias and halfe, which was never before more then 3, the like in allejars halfe a peece more then usuall, whereupon I demanded the cargoe ashoare which you were pleased to consigne mee per bill of loading, but in the presence of Captain Lowe and Captain Rickard, hee absolutely refused to deliver itt to mee, saying that haveing possession hee had 11 points of the law, and that hee would make use of that part of itt which was most ready to buy Negroes, the rest hee would deliver mee when hee had his complement, since which the pyrates came downe, by whome he says he was plundered and the goods lost, though I can prove that part of the cargoe consign'd to mee was sent to windward in his boate without my approvall, which was sunk per the pyrates, and for anything I know, might be a greate occasion the ships were taken, for the people in the boate inform'd the pyrates in what posture the ships lay, with their yards and topmasts downe, and many of their men on shoare. I have acquainted the Royall Company att large herewith and have given them coppie of his bill of loading for the goods, with bills of loading for the slaves hee said he had aboard, and those aboard Captain Lowe, the same you will receive enclosed, and have likewise sent others to the Royall Companys factors in the West Indias according to your order. I found Mr Armitage ready and willing to comply with your order in all things, and doubt not would have been verry helpefull to mee had hee lived, hee departed this life the 15th ultimo, haveing laine sick above 10 days, and by mee and others often advised to settle his estate, and make up his accounts with the Company, which hee neglected to doe, however after his decease in the presence of severall English men, I inventory'd what concerns of his was in the factory, and have taken itt into my possession, of which the Royall Company and his freinds in England shall have a just accompt. I have now no person with mee whom I dare trust (except William Belwood), haveing sent Mr Still to Ophra, and the rest that came downe with mee I find to be such sottish fellowes, that I dare not be out of the factory an houre unless I leave Belwood att home, for which reason I most humbley intreate your favourable construction for my non complyance with your order in sending him up, for I can at present as well spare my right hand as him. Captain Quow hath been att Ophra, being ordered by mee to proceed according to your instruction, hee will give you an account of the Phidalgo's answer to his pallavora. I likewise desired Captain Rickard to acquaint him with every circumstance of your order, and hee tells me that the Phidalgoe replyed that the first ship of the Companys that goes thither shall have Thorne aboard, provided they will carry him to England and not to Cabo Corsoe, and that hee will comply with all your demands whensoever the Company begins to continue their trade with him. If I might advise, I think itt would not bee amiss to order one ship thither for tryall, and accordingly the Royall Company may proceed with these people. Mr Windover continues still at Appa about 15 leagues to leward of this place. I have informed Captain Wyborne according to your order, that hee [= Wendover] is considerably in the Companys debt and that if he detaines him itt will be att his own perrill, to which hee returned that hee was not anywise imployed by him, and promised mee to use his endeavour to gett him heither, when he doth I shall comply with your order in sending him to Cabo Corsoe. The present you were pleased to send the King of Guydah was thankfully received per him, with many promises of continuing a faire correspondence with the Royall Company, but if masters of ships have liberty to give what they please for their slaves and spoyle trade att their pleasure, the endeavours of the factors they have will be frustrate, and this place in short time of noe advantage to them. Andrew Crosbie went off in Captain Churchey, and Robert Chapman is dead. Captain Wyburne is lately returned from a place called Abree, about 16 leagues to windward of Guydah, where hee hath been about 6 weekes buying slaves for Captain Booth, an interloper. I understand itt is a good place for slaves, and doe know that Wyburne intends to settle a Whiteman there, but had I your order I would prevent him, or att leastwise share the trade of that place by hoysting a flagg there for the Royall Company. The cheife goods they covett are booges, tapsells, allejars and pintado's. I have enclosed return'd your letter to Captain Waugh, who was gon off the coast before the pyrates came downe. I heare he gott his slaves att Quitto, a place about 5 leagues to leward of the River of Vallta. Hee came not downe to Guydah, but I am credibly inform'd hee sent mee a letter which Captain Woolliford intercepted and never came to my hands, soe can give you noe further account of him. Captain Lumley arrived here two dayes since, whoe I doubt not may have his complement in 10 dayes, he giveing the same rates that others have don before him, without which nothing is to be don, unless these people see that wee can send our ships to Ophra. Had I a good supply of booges, I might probablely, when ships are absent, bring them to the old rate, and I am sure, could in 10 dayes time, noe ships being here, purchase a good parcell of slaves for the next ship that came. The goods most in request att present are booges, corrall, white baftas, broad pintado's, white ground, allejars, sletias, white pautkaes, and brass panns. If your Worship would be pleased to entrust me with a small parcell of each, itt shall be my greate care to imploy them to the utmost advantage of the Royall Company, and desire that I may have a proportionable part in booges, for without halfe in halfe noe slaves are to be had, and I doe hereby reiterate the promise I made to you att Cabo Corsoe of being faithfull to my masters and not to convert their stock to the use of interlopers."
495,1,495,Petley Wyburne,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,26/06/1683,Fort,RAC,"Your letters of the 30th December and 23d March I have received, which binds me soe much to serve you that I shall never be able to performe my duty, but will to my power. I have never refused the Companys service nor I never will, but truely without a verry great loss I cannot leave this place in a little time, not soe soon as to have oppertunity to waite upon you att Cabo Corsoe before you goe, if you goe when your first three yeares is out. In what I can be serviceable to the Company here, I will and doe itt faithfully, The Dutch are setleing a factory att Popoe, which they have had formerly, itt is 8 leagues from this place. I have an acquaintance about 8 leagues to windward of itt. The cheife people have obliged themselves to mee, I know itt is a place that in a short time would be verry convenient for the Company, being well managed, there is noe gold but there is aggree and slaves, corne always is plenty; I have some trade with them, I send from Guydah to this place by river. If I can serve the Company in settleing a factory for them and you are pleased to send a quallified man or two for that purpose, I will not question the doeing of itt. I question not but I could send you a letter to Accra within land. Mr Winder shall want nothing I can serve him in. I trouble you not. with account of pyrates because he tells me hee doth."
496,1,496,Samuel Starland,"Aboard the African Merchant, Unspecified",African Merchant,Cape Coast Castle,03/08/1683,Coasting Voyage,RAC,"Yesterday I received yours from Commenda by the hand of Captain Bracons 1 couzen, and according to your orders I shall doe the utmost of my endeavour. When he brought the letter hee told mee that Captain Bracon would have mee send 100 of niccanees ashoare, but hee sent noe money soe I sent him none. And this morning hee came a board with money for 100 and would have had 50 more without, and said that Bracon was very angry, for it was your order that hee should have what hee sent for, but I have sent him none as yet nor shall not without your order. Wee are now about a league to windward of the Mine and in hopes within a day or two to fetch Commenda, which has seemed to mee a very long passage. As for the prizes of good[s] I can give you little account at present, onely this, wee have had severall canoes aboard, I could have sold halfe the powder at 5 pease 2 angles per barrell for noe more, and severall of the blew baftes the broad at 5a and the narrow att 2a, and most of the best knives at la per dozen, but what the prizes will be att Commenda I know not as yet."

I have disposed since of all the niccanees I had and 4 barrels powder, 1 say, 1 gingham, 1 piece of baft broad. This day Captain Bracon came aboard, whome I treated according to your worshipps command as well as the shipp could afford, him and all the rest of his friends. If you think fitt to send mee any more niccanees, which I find here the onely commodity att present, be pleased to let mee have them soe soone as your worshipp can, I beleeve I may dispose of as many more as I had and according to the raites I gave you an account of before, I find the same proffers here by most that come aboard. I onely gave you an account in my last of what I had found betwene the place I then rid att att [sic: and?] Cape Corsoe, not that I intended to trust any goods ashoare or sell any under the rates I had your order for."
498,1,498,Samuel Starland,Comenda Road,African Merchant,Cape Coast Castle,28/08/1681,Coasting Voyage,RAC,"These are to give you notice that I sent the canoe a Satureday up to Captain Woodfine to give him an account that you would not have him dispose of any of his goods till advice from your worshipp, and the last night about 8 a clock she came aboard againe, otherwise I had sent her downe before now. A Sunday Captain Brakon was aboard of him. I desired to know the reason wee had noe trade here, hee told mee because our goods was att too deare a rate. I desired him for to tell mee the prizes that they would give for such goods as I have a board, which according to his price I have here sent your worshipp an account, per 1 say lo 2a, 12 musketts per bendy, per one barrell powder lo 4a, per 1 gingham 5a, per 1 broad baft 5a, per 1 ditto narrow 3a, 1 pewter jugg 4a, per 1 dozen knives of the best sort la, for the other 6ta, per 1 lead barr la, which hee saith hee can buy soe out of the Company ships and out of interlopers a great deale cheaper. He saith if wee can sell them soe, that they will come here before any other shipps. I have now on board 15m 4o 7a of gold and one man slave."

There is all their men come in the canoe, onely two which is left aboard.

I have ordred the boatswaine to suffer nothing to goe out of her, and likewise I told their owne two men which is aboard her to see that nothing be disposed of. I have taken all the slaves I found aboard her aboard mee, there being 8, 1 man 4 women 3 boys, and the next morning I understood by them there was 10 aboard, the other two being carried aboard Captain Rickard that night she was taken by his canoemen. Yesterday I was aboard him to see if they were there, and hee told mee that they came contrary to his order or knowledge. The rogery I find was in the canoemen, itt being in the night they thought not I beleeve to be discovered. Captain Rickard told mee I might have them or leave them aboard, hee beleeveing that your worshipp would order him the rest, if not he would give a receipt for them, they being 1 woeoman 1 boy, soe I left them aboard.

As for the interlopers threatning to lay mee aboard, hee was att the same time more afraid of being laid a board himselfe, for hee presently waid and stood off to sea and I after him for the space of two hours, and then I stood in againe and about an houre afterwards he tackt and stood in againe and came to an anchor, and the next morning I waid and came to anchor alongst his side, and yesterday about 3 a clock hee waid and this morning wee see him att anchor a great deale to leward off of Amersa.

I sent your worship an account before by the same canoe that brought the letters which was writt by Charles [Towgood], and I have lain here ever since in expectation of your worships further order. In my last I forgott to give you an account that Captain Woodfine would desire your worship to tell his brother not to goe ashoare to Annamaboe upon any account whatsoever, for hee said that the Blacks would certainly murder him. I have sent per the canoe the boatswaine to bring downe the boate if your worship pleases, for if wee should breake a cable wee should want her very much. Mr Richards this morning sent aboard two men in irons desireing mee to keepe them aboard, they being two of the blacks which endeavoured to panyar him.

I was then in the towne, for I lay that night ashoare. The people of Wyamba being surprised ran away soe fast as they could, without any resistance at all. They have killed a great many of them and carried a great many away. I have lost one of my canoemen, whether hee bee killed or carryed away I cannot heare, but they have cutt off Mattees head, his body lies in the bushes. Myselfe with the other canoeman lay in the bushes about 6 or 7 hours and then wee gott out and went for Barracoe some 5 leagues to leward of Wyamba. I lost all my cloaths only [= except] shirt and drawers with 4 ounces of the Companys that I had received ashoare, which if I live to see your worship I shall give you a farther account.

The 28th of March I waied from Wyamba and the 31st ditto I came to an anchor a little to the westward of Momford, where I sent my canoe ashoare with Parrett in her to see if they had any slaves, and when hee came aboard hee told mee that hee see the canoeman ashoare which I lost att Wyamba, but they would not lett him come off except I would pay for him as much as another slave. I have not concerned myselfe in itt, I desire that your Worship would be pleased to order mee what I shall doe in it. The last night about 7 of the clock three of our gudgings broake away from our sterne post, and one we had lost before, we haveing only the upper one left, and wee were forst to gett our ruther in upon deck and have noe way to hang him againe. Your Worship was pleas'd to order mee to Accra, but if I should goe downe now I should be in a bad condition for to gett up to Capo Corsoe againe. I doe not question but to hang him againe upon 3 gudgings more besides that as is left, if I can gett up to take all our things out and bring her by the head.

They have nothing to say to Mr Richards, only that hee had made them pay for that hee had given them before, and for the townes people they say that they had noe hand in the matter, soe this is all the satisfaction that I heare is like to be given by either of them. Mr Richards this afternoon sent off 13 iron barrs and towards night came off himselfe, hee told mee without any hinderance att all, and tomorrow morning I intends to goe ashoare againe and if hee finds not other satisfaction intends for to send off all the goods if not prevented. The demand made by him was that those two Anishan people that was the first actors should be turned out of the towne, and that the second of the Arcanies and the two that were taken with the goods should be sent up to your Worship, and 40 marke of gold should be paid besides.

The Wyamba people sayes that here is some of them ly's lurking to and again about about the towne. I had a letter writt 3 day's agoe to have given your Worship an account of this, because I heard Mr Towgood saying hee intended to water at Wyamba, but [through] the badness of the weather I could not send the canoe. The last night came to an anchor here Mr Towgood, and this morning sailes. If any of the ships come downe itt will not be safe for them to send their boats for water at Wyamba. Since I came to an anchor here I have bought 6 men slaves and taken about 5 marke of gold.

The French man had nothing but bouges, which the natives wanted at that time to buy corne, soe that as long as hee lay here I could not gett a slave; and the day before hee went away which was Fryday Captain Gates came to anchor here, and hee gives such rates that I am like to lye here a considerable time, besides his pintados are broad and mine are all narrow and hee gives as many of his for a slave as I can of mine, soe that I cannot expect to sell any of mine till his bee all gon and then hope they will goe off. I have made shift since hee has been here to gett 8 good men, 6 woemen and 2 boyes with 2 girles, 18 in all which are all verry goode slaves; but I have been forc'd to give 1 angle upon a head for a man more then what your worship has allowed or elce they would have gon aboard Captain Gates. I intend the first oppertunity of a wind to turne up to Ningo, a place 4 leagues to windward of this place, where I understand there are a few slaves, for I cannot expect to gett many slaves here as long as hee lies here without I could give as great rates as hee, which is a bendy a head. I wish I had a few green and blew perpettuanos more, for those that I had of that sort which were 8 are all gone and they aske for them now extreamly. Just now my canoe came from the shoare, but the sea runs so high that they are not able neither will they venture to bring off a slave.

This goes by my canoe, which I have lent to Mr Shears because shee is not able to carry mee anywhere, shee being all to peeces; soe I shall borrow his canoe if I have any occasion, and I would pray your Worship that if you have anyother that you can spare that you would be pleased to send itt by the canoemen, I not knowing what to doe without one, and that your Worship will be pleas'd when you order Mr Shears downe, to order him to lett mee have one of his slaves hee haveing 3, 1 haveing great occasion, makeing 500 stroaks a glass.

[PS] Mr Shears presents his service to your Worship and desires to know whether hee shall goe to windward without mee if that you order mee otherwise. I would desire your Worship that if you can spare another canoe that you would be pleased to send itt in the roome of this that comes downe, shee not being able to swim above water.
There is more in this pallavora then I can immagine about these goods.
[PS] Since the wrighting of this letter the blacks sent word that they would not take the great basons. And just now arrived here the Arcanie Marchant, Captain Attwell, soe I sent the canoe on board him to know if hee had any commands for Capo Corsoe, upon which hee sent mee a pacquett which I have forwarded to your Worship."

I am just now goeing aboard intending to saile, haveing gott my wood and corne, but faine to give great rates for itt, there lying 3 ships here; I should have had itt before now but that the bad weather that has been here for 4 or 5 days hindred them from bringing itt; which bad weather I am afraid will be a great hinderance to mee att Allampo.
[Towgood proceeded to Beraku, where he arrived on 29 May, and left there on 30 May 1682 (no.510). Around the beginning of June 1682, he was at Accra, from where he called at Teshi (no.429).]"
530,1,530,Charles Towgood,Alampo Road,Cape Coast,Cape Coast Castle,23/06/1682,Coasting Voyage,RAC,"I had given your Worship an account of my proceeding before now but that bad weather hindered it. I haveing been here this 3 weeks and have gott noe slaves by reason of 2 Dutch ships that has been here that had great store of cowries, and likwise 2 English interlopers, but nevertheless I had gott slaves if the Dutch Companys ships had not given the Negroes greate dasheys that they should not come aboard of mee; which I should not have knowne but that the Negro's themselves told mee that the Chiefe Cabusheers of the towne would prendee them a cow if any came aboard of mee with slaves. Since which time one of the Dutch ships is gone and the other has but few good goods that is fitt for this place, soe that I should have had slaves but that Captain Attwell came downe just as I had made the pallavora (which was a Sunday last) and gives such greate rates that I cannot expect to gett any, soe that I intend to turne up to windward with first oppertunity about 6 leages to windward of this place, where there is both gold and slaves, hopeing to dispose of most of my goods. Mr Starland about 12 day's since came to this place without an anchor, soe I lent him one of mine to ride by for the present, haveing but one left myselfe, since which time hee procured one out of one of the Dutch ships but gave a very great rate, which hee could not helpe because my anchor would not ride him, hee driveing athwart the Dutchmans harse; soe hee intends likewise to turne up to Accra with the first conveniency. I beleeve Mr Smith inform'd your Worship of the great leake I sprung att Accra, since which I have sprung another, they are both in the worst places of the vessell to be come att, one of them being in the very scagg [sic: =?] of the sterne post, the other in the stem or rather between that and a false stem, which cannot be come att without cutting some timbers, which will endanger the vessell. The force of itt wee have stop't by stuffing in a great quantity of tallow and coales beate together, nothing else being to be done. Captain Attwell told meethat your Worship ordered him to putt his remaines aboard of mee when he had done here, because your Worship cares not how little goods goe to Arda, soe that I intend if your Worship doe not order mee to the contrary to come downe when he is ready to goe and take them in."

Since I have been here I have gott wood and water from the forte, which I wanted extreamly, and taken all the slaves that Mr Hassell had in the forte that was any thing likely, that is 12 men, 20 woemen and 1 boy, in all 33, and have on board att present 28 good slaves, soe that I hope with what slaves I shall gett in turning up and what Mr Starland and what Mr Shears will gett will make a good quantity. Mr Shears haveing purchased about 20 odd slaves comeing downe, which hee putt aboard of Mr Starland, desired a few goods of mee to make up a full complement att Allampo, which I spared him, that is 20 sayes and 20 perpettuanoes, and likewise lett Mr Hassell have 1 case of sayes, a bale of perpetuano's and 48 tapsells, which I tooke their receipts for.

I cannot sell one of the musketts, they are soe verry bad, and I have sold verry few of the perpettuano's red, by reason that they have warrs in the place where they vend them.

Wee lay att Cape Appalonia 10 dayes, and in that time the 8th vessell, and wee sold only 25 barrells powder and some sheets and 10 three pound basons, the powder att lo 12a 0ta a barrell, and could gett noe more because the other ships sold at lo 8ata. And as for treating with the natives, wee did what wee could, but they will not lett any man to settle on shoare because the country people are their masters and then they shall gett nothing to live on, and they say they must looke to themselves and doe not want ships to goe on board of. Mr Sanders is dead, hee dyed the last Sunday. Since I have sold 40 odd perpetuano's, as for sayes they proffer noe more then 14 angles a piece. Iron and tallow they doe not take.

I have heard by the blacks of a ship cast away to windward, which I suppose these rogues have taken and sunk, for they took severall goods on the shoare and Sunday last wee tooke up a muskett chest empty. Sorry I am for what hath befell Captain Lumley and the rest. As for Succondee people they would have us stay till the people come out of the country that they have sent up, I would have the Cabosheers come on board but they would not, but sent the Teetee, but hee spake as before mentioned.

Fryday last came the Braffoe of Succondee and the Tetee came up to Dickiscove to us, and would not goe on shoare before wee went downe to Succondee and then not without the flagg, because the Addoomes had threatned them, soe yesterday they sett up our flagg, and afterwards came a Cabosheer that was sent from the Addoomes to see the flagg sett up, [he] came on board with the Captain of the souldiers and their wives and attendants, because they say they were never on board
of a ship before, but I rather beleeve they came to see what would be given them, the which I could not doe otherwise but to give them a dashey on your Worships behalfe, soe this morning the abovementioned Cabosheers hath taken Captain Quow and Captain Coffee up in the country with them and they say they will be here a Thursday next.

This afternoon is come a great boate and a great canoe from the Mina to take their goods away, which now they brought some to the waterside. Pray dispatch the canoe.

As for disposeing of goods I must not expect to dispose of noe more whilst I lye here, for Captain Clarke arriv'd here on Thursday last, whose factor goes in this canoe.

What your Worship pleaseth that I shall that I shall doe as concerning this man, whether hee shall goe in the country to his master or stay here any longer, for I beleeve he begins to be weary of staying here soe long. As for the Dutch the remainder of their goods and slaves went away yesterday, one Whiteman still remaining. The sooner your Worship sends, the less charges itt will be, for I assure your Worship I have been att charges this 3 weeks wee have been here since wee came from Dickiscove, and as wee lay there passed by land a Dutchman from Occada, and as I was told hee said to the Blacks of that place that the Generall of Cabo Corsoe gave them only a flagg but would not settle the place this 2 or 3 yeares, and lett them not have the occasion to say the same by this place, for they take all occasion to doe what ill they can."

[PS] Just att the closeing up of my letter came off a canoe from shoare to tell mee that the reason that the bores was not come downe was because they were fighting with the Mumford people and would be downe tomorrow."

The reason of my long stay att Barracoe was because after I had been there 3 or 4 day's and had noe trade, the Queen sent downe her man to excuse itt and withall to tell mee that I should have money the next day, but twas noe such thing for I did not receive one angle, soe I came for this place and gave Mr Hassell your Worships letter, but hee tells mee hee will take none of the goods, only sheets and iron barrs. I shall make all the hast up that possible I can as soone as hee hath taken the goods out, without your Worships orders to the contrary.

Here lyes att present att this place 2 interlopers, the one Captain How and the other Captain Price in Finchams Catt, the latter of which came yesterday, but I beleeve neither of them has taken any money since they came here, for I have not seen one canoe goe aboard of them. Yesterday by a canoe that came from windward I was inform'd that there was a Companys ship att Dickiscove that would be downe about 4 or 5 dayes but the Commanders name I cannot informe my selfe of.

As for goods I heare not of any thats more vendible then those I have on board but am not like to sell any, for as the Negro's tells mee Captain Price sells for 13 angles a say and 8 per perpetuanoe.

I have not sold any thing since my last to your Worship, onely one halfe barrell of powder and the remainder of the sheets, for there has been noe trade to speak of since before yesterday. Just att my closeing up of the letter I received one from your Worship and Councill wherein I was ordered to procure one barrell of pitch and one ditto of tarr, which I have don out of one of the ships that is here, but would not pay for itt before acquainted your Worship with the price vizt one barrell of pitch, 1 ounce and one ditto of tarr halfe an ounce, soe shall only stay for your Worships further orders.

I kept a light for him till 11 a clock to come into the roade this morning (for twas calme all night). I see the two ships aweigh as likewise Captain Lumley, one of the two ships standing to windward and the other to leward, but presently the ship that stood up tackt and stood downe againe and Captain Lumley being taken astayes, was forc't to stand up, att which time the Frenchman was almost aboard him with a red ensigne but our King's jack (with which hee tooke all the ships), and presently fired a valley of small shott and three great guns with shott, att which time Captain Lumley answered him in the like with two pateraro's and some small armes and then the Frenchman fired about 8 or 10 guns shott and all as likewise about some 3 or 4 valley's more of small shott, which carried away Captain Lumley's foot of his maine sayle out of the bolt rope and as I beleeve kill'd Captain Lumley, for I presently see the ensigne struck halfe mast downe and the ship yeilded to the Frenchmans boate which presently went aboard of her, and soone after Thomas Amamaboe came from him to mee and told mee to goe under the forte, which [I] was ready to doe before but could not for had noe wind, but I sent ashoare a note by him to Mr Thelwall to send mee off some great and small canoes, which hee did, which towed us in under the forte, where wee now lye, and presently I see the Frenchman take the two interlopers without fireing a gun, the one being Captain Summervill the Scotch man, the other Captain Lowes brother Thompson. I likewise understand by the Blacks that they tooke a Dutchman up to windward and left the men ashoare at Succondee. I suppose the biggest of the two ships might have about 28 or 30 gunns, being well mann'd to sight. I only stay here for your Worships further orders, for itt will be in vaine to goe before the Frenchman be passed by Accra, which I beleeve will be in a day or two.

However if I had a designe to weigh, to doe any good upon itt I could not, the currant runing soe strong to leward and the weather calme.

As to an account of our proceedings here, be pleased to know that wee had noe trade to windward of Accra, and what wee had since was most at Tishue. All the goods sold for gold are 15 pieces sayes, 3 perpetuanoes and 8 Guyney stuffs, amounting to Mk2 lo 8a 8ta, the which money Mr Groome hath sent up per bearer. There are 18 slaves aboard, which were puchast one with another for 5 pieces sayes, 5 barrells powder, 105 sheets 7 pieces Guyney stuffs, 17 pieces course sletias, 12 iron barrs. Wee arrived att Allampo 2 dayes agoe (expecting better trade then to Windward), where there are slaves to be purchased but they rate them att 7 and 6 pease per head, men and woemen, vallueing our goods noe higher then att Cabo Corsoe, soe that there is little hopes of doeing any good except the prizes be advanced.

According to your honours order I have sent by the whiteman in the 3 hand canoe what gold I have taken, which is but little itt being 2m lo 8a 8ta. The whiteman seeing itt weighted and sealed itt, being upon the Royall Companys account, and as for the trade wee have had, has been verry small, till wee were past Accra, for wee had not tooke one ounce of gold till wee came to Tisall [sic], where wee found but small trade for gold and slaves, for they houlding them att such deare rates that my purchase of slaves is but small, there being but 18 in number. The goods that purchast them are 5 sayes, 5 barrells of powder, 17 course sletias, 105 sheets, 12 iron barrs and 7 Guyney stuffs. I being in hopes of haveing a better trade att Allampo then I found to windward, I made the best of my way downe, where I did arrive 2 dayes agoe, where I find that there is slaves but they houlding them up att such deare rates that wee cannot purchase any but for powder, for they vallue our goods att noe dearer rates then they are att Cabo Corsoe and att them rates they hold their slaves att 7 peazes and 6. I am certainely inform'd by the Blacks that this last night there was a Dutch canoe passed by from Ardra, whoe gives account of 2 English ships being taken, but the Dutch escaped. I find but little encouragement of staying here, therefore doe God willing intend by the first oppertunity up to Accra, where I doe hope I shall have further order from your honour to advance upon the price or to come up to Cabo Corsoe.

I have used my best endeavour to gett up to Accra ever since the 1st of this instant, but by reason of a streame setting strong to leward and noe land breeze have been rather a looser than a gainer, although itt was this day I being under sayle standing into the shoare when the canoe came aboard, I being some 4 miles to windward of Allampo. And while I was standing in, the Portuguze waighed and made the best of his way for Ardra, hee purchaseing some 70 or 80 slaves att this Allampo, but the rates hee gave was verry greate, hee giveing for a woeman slave 7 peazes, which was little under 2 sayes, and 2 sayes for a man, likewise advanceing upon all other goods. I shall give your honour account att my returne; I made itt my business to know the reason wherefore hee did soe much advance upon slaves above the Companys price, his answer was hee gave not above 7 peazes 2a for a man and 6 [peaze] 1 angles for a woeman, considering he bought the sayes to windward for 14a and other goods verry cheape. I finding the currant to continue to leward and the Portuguze being gon, Mr Harper and I did consult what to doe, and did think itt the best way for the Companys interest for him to goe ashoare and see wheither they would lett us have slaves att your honours rates or noe, if not to take my first oppertunity to gett up to Cabo Corsoe according to order."

There is now 32 slaves aboard, but the currant goeing strong to leward and all the provisions for the slaves expended, Mr Groome thought fitt to come up him selfe that hee might know your honours further orders, haveing with him the money in cash and an account of the goods that are disposed of, and if itt should please your Honour to order the slaves ashoare, sending downe a cargoe of sayes, powder, sheets, and allejars I doubt not but wee shall purchase a cargoe of slaves that will answer your honours expectation."

575,1,575,James Nightingale,Wyamba,Edgar,Cape Coast Castle,09/03/1681,Transatlantic Voyage,RAC,"Accordinge your Honours order [I] delivered the 5 hand canoe in all hast to Mr Franckland att 8 a clock at night, but he did not depart the shipp tell morning. Have sent per ditto canoe for the 200 pieces brawlls and 20 pieces long cloths your honour ordered me to receave from Mr Windover, butt yett noe more from ditto Windover than 120 pieces brawlls whereof above 40 pieces damnified, and allso 20 pieces long cloth all damnifyed.
Wee have alsoe a great quantity of damnifyed tapseels good for nothing at all, eatten up by the worme, they came 5 or 6 years agoe per Captain Powlegrines [var. Polgreen].
As to our proseeding I hope will goe on well, butt at our comeing in this roade we found 2 English interloopers which gott all the slaves that was at the water side, but I comeing ashoar hinderd their design, alsoe spoke to the natives to cut away their boats, but they [= the interlopers] came to understand the same [and] went away from thence to windwards.
The Queen of Anguina will be downe with me next Fryday and then I hope will bring downe some slaves, but they are very deare. The interloopers have given 2 ounces of gold for a slave.
Heare came by yesterday a canoe from Alampo, the canoe men reportes that att ditto place is 6 sayles of shipes, 2 Duch 2 English interloopers and 2 Portugees. The slaves there are dire [= dear?] and full of the small pox, the onely commodity there is coures [= cowries] and long cloths, the which we have not aboard. Notwithstanding I doe assure your Honour and Counsell that I will doe my utmost indeavour for the creditt and proffit of my masters the Royall Affrican Company according to mean capassety.
Wee want here iron barrs and would have sent for the same to your Honour and Counsell, but Mr Franckland beeing one board of our shipp tould Captain Bowler and his mate it was but a folly to send to your Honour and Counsell for any more goods, you had entrusted with me so much goods already, and that I was a pittiful rasskall, and when I came to Accra [he] would kick me downe stayres, and that if had but spooke to your Honour you would putt him in my place, and severall other words not fitt to be write. I doe assure your Honnour that itt troubles me much to see a man affront his fellow companyon undeserved, I desier God to doe by him as he would be done by. Soe having noe more att present onely hope God Almighty will bless your honour and Counsell in all health and prosperity, and assure yourselfe and Counsell that there shall be nothing wanting to dispach Captain Bowler what lieth in my capascity.
[PS] Mr Bicknall will give your Honour a furder account. Pray excuse me this, being ritten on my hast.
Mr Bicknall has delivered Mr John Hilliard abourd the shipp Edgar, [he] came last night here.
Captain Bowler desiers your Honour and Counsell to give him a receipt for his slaves, corne [and] mallegettee which he bought out of his windward cargo."
576,1,576,James Nightingale/Robert Hollings,Alampo,Edgar,Cape Coast Castle,25/03/1681,Transatlantic Voyage,RAC,"This brings an account of our proceedings since wee left Caboe Corsoe. To mention the number of Negroe slaves wee received from Annamaboe may be unnecessary, wee proceed to relate what Negroe slaves wee purchased at Wyamba and soe leeward to this place. Our purchase at Wyamba was in all 13 Negroe slaves. Some time wee spent there, for that the natives promised a great trade for slaves, if wee would stay, which when wee found frustrate, wee sail'd downe to Accra. Here indeed wee had the choyce of 19 Negroe slaves, out of which wee could hardly find 7 fitt to be putt aboard shipp. Wee fear some may be conceald, for what reason know not, the fault is not ours. From Accra wee received 120 pieces brawles, and those much damaged; wee likewise received 20 pieces of long cloth, in which but 4 pieces vendible. This is not the way to dispatch the shipp, her demorage  approaching, and the charge great, besides our cargoe on board is not vendible, the one halfe. By invoyce inclosed is mentoned what goods wee want, without which wee cann proceed noe farther, and it may be supposed the Royall Company will enquire the occasion of payment of freight more then by bill of lading shall be made manifest. This is what we ought to acquaint your Worshipp with, to avoid prolexity is our care. Wee are now promised a quantity of slaves if goods to purchase them. Wee wait your Worshipps answer.

577,1,577,Robert Hollings,Alampo,Edgar,Cape Coast Castle,25/03/1681,Transatlantic Voyage,RAC,"Per this conveyance your Worshipp will receive the needfull menconed as to the ships dispatch. I have farther thought it requisite to acquint your Worshipp of our way in negotiacon, vizt Mr James Nightingale continued ashore at the severall places of trading, for which there is an absolute necessity, per reason wee meete interlopers, Portugues and Dutch ships, where wee come. I send him what goods he writes for, and soe far as I can yett perceive hee does use the utmost of his endeavour for the Royall Company intrest. I goe some times on shore to inspect his actions, and shall continue in the same while wee are upon the coast, and at the shipp[s] dispatch shall carefully render your Worshipp a faithfull accompt of all transactions etc."
578,1,578,Charles Bowler,Alampo,Edgar,Cape Coast Castle,25/03/1681,Transatlantic Voyage,RAC,"My occasion of my writing unto you at present is that my time groweth very short according to charter partye, which is not above 7 dayes longer affter the deate hereof, and therefore I desire your Worship and Councills letter for my security for the 20 dayes of demorage by order in Charter partye by the Royall Affrican Company of England there, which I think my selfe not secured without your Worshipp and Councills order, for at this time wee have on board of our ship but 101 Negroe slaves on board, which is not one third part of our complement, but wee are promised the rest in 4 weekes time after the date hereof. If itt be nott, it will be for want of good goods, and if it should please your Worship and Councill I was informed at Accra that Mr Thelwall had purchased about 20 slaves, which would doe me a great kindness now in our destress, and one thing I would desire your Worship if you please to send me a receipt for the 22 slaves that I bought to windward, malligeeta and corne, which you [have] the account of it with you."
579,1,579,James Nightingale,Alampo,Edgar,Cape Coast Castle,06/04/1681,Transatlantic Voyage,RAC,"My last to your honour was the 24th March, wherein I desired of your honour more recrutt of goods by reason sayes, perpettuanes, Ginny stuffs, Welch plaines, knives doe not goe of for slaves, and the Dutch shipp lying heare with good cowries, long cloth, fine sletias, bright musquetts, also gives a great rate for slaves, putts me to a stand, also is heare 2 English interlopers which gives 2 ounces of gold for a slave. Therefore pray consider in what a condition wee are in. I doe ashure yor honour I doe my best indeavour.
The Negroes promises faire, but currant goods purchases slaves, which are broad tapseeles, long clothes white, sheets, brawles, fine sletias, broad nicanneese, allejares, read ground pintadoes, bright musquetts, but especally cowries. Wee have not above 135 Negroes aboard, but the people of the countrey which are gone for slaves are not come downe. Wee expect them dayly with a good quantity, and then will doe my indeavour.
Your honour is not unsensable how far wee have gott in the 20 dayes of demorage after the 64 according to charter party, therefore pray lett me have your Honours and Councills order if you thinke it convenient for Captain Bowler to stay longer upon the coast then the 20 dayes. It would be a great shame, also noe little charges to our masters that the first ship by your Honours dispatched from Guiny should goe without her complement of slaves or there about.
My small oppinion is this, that if your honour keepe the shipp longer then the 20 dayes, and send some of the goods afore mentioned, especially broad tapseeles and some other of those which are in the Castle, I doe beleeve by degreese and good industry wee may gitt the ships complement of slaves or there about, in 6 weekes time.
In my last I forgott to mention of 5 pieces of sayes and 24 blew potkeys I sent to James Mills and Galansa at Wyamba in the 2 hand canoe, with an order to dispose of them for slaves against the canoe comes backe, and if I find good trade would send the 5 hand canoe with more goods, by reason sayes doe not goe of here, I ordered him likewise if could git noe slaves for the goods, to dispose of them for gold, and send it per the 2 hand canoe, for gold will purchase slaves heare. I doe ashure your honour and Councill that I study every way to gitt slaves for the ship.
I have been like to dye, and had a fitt for 24 houres [so] that I was forsed to be tyed hand and feeit, but praised be God I am very well recovered. I could right your honour a great deale, but will leave it tell I see your honour in parson."

Wee have aboard 140 slaves, and doe what wee can to procure more, with those goods which are vendable. Captain Bowler intends to saile this day sennet for Acra, and there to land the remains, and there to depart the coast without your Worshipp and Councell order him to the contrary of staying. In the meane time wee will doe what wee can for the ships dispatch. Soe having noe more to inlarge onely refer our meane capassity to your honours further order, which shall be punctually obeyed."
581,1,581,Charles Bowler,Between Alampo and Wyamba,Edgar,Cape Coast Castle,20/04/1681,Transatlantic Voyage,RAC,"These few lynes are to certifie you that I am resolved to saile to morrow night for Accra, and therefore I desire you to dispatch your buisness to morrow, and come off, for I see noe hopes of the 15 hand canoe comeing downe."
582,1,582,James Nightingale/Robert Hollings,Between Accra and Wyamba,Edgar,Cape Coast Castle,25/04/1681,Transatlantic Voyage,RAC,"Last Saterday wee sailed from Alampa and came the last night about 2 a clock in the morning off Accra. Wee sent presently our canoe a shoare to see what orders where there, wee received your Honour and Councells letter dated the 21st instant wherein wee heard the loss of the 15 hand canoe, goods, white men, and slaves, wherefore wee are hartyly sorrey. Per inclosed comes the coppy of Captain Bowlers note, allsoe [that] of Mr Wendover, the aforesaid Bowler saying that he wanted water to supply his complement of slaves and that would stay noe longer then the 20 dayes according to charter party without he had your Honours and Councells order thereunto, with a proviseall that the Royall Company should pay him.
Wee being at Alampa did our best to gitt what slaves wee could, but wanting a supply of goods was a great hinderance to us, but seeing your Honour and Councill did your indeavour gives us some hopes. The inhabitance at ditto place seeing wee had noe goods vendable beguane to play the rogue with Nightingale a shoare, but with much trouble gott all safe off. He himselfe both goeing ashore and coming aboard was most drounded.
Wee have aboard in all about 200 slaves, and wee will doe what wee can to procure more at Wyamba while ditto Bowler gitts his water, and I will give him noe dispatch till furthur orderd of your honour and Councell. If wee must procure slaves at Wyamba, wee will want broad tapseeles, bright musquetts, brawles and sheets. If your honour and Councell order us to sell those goods for gold which wee cannot for slaves, will follow order, perhaps wee may gitt slaves for gold. At Accra are 4 English interlopers and 2 Dutch ditto. Per the next shall give your Honour and Councell a further account, in the meane time wee will doe what wee can, but if the ship stayes wee will want those goods afore mentioned"
583,1,583,Charles Bowler,Wyamba,Edgar,Cape Coast Castle,25/04/1681,Transatlantic Voyage,RAC,"These few lynes are to certifie you that I sett sail from Alampa a Saterday last, being the 23rd instant, I waiting some sartin [= certain] dayes expecting the 15 hand canoewith a supply of goods which I did understand by your Worshipps letter, but seeing noe hopes of her coming I thought it convenient to make the best of my way for Wyamba to fill our water againe, but by the way of Accra. I doe understand of your great lost of the 15 hand canoe, the which I am hartiely sorrey for it, and I understand by your last that Mr Wendover wrotte you concerning Mr Kyte that I would not take him in, which is abominable lye, I onely denying his great cheste which would take up more rume than a tun would containe, which Mr Nightingale and Mr Hollings was at present and ditto Nightingale did order Mr Wendover not to lett him imbarke upon noe interloper what soe ever. Concerning your last letter the 21st instant to Mr Nightingale, I understand you have given order not to dispatch me untill I have my complement of 320 slaves, whereof I have not above two thirds of them yett and my time by charter party hath been out this 6 dayes and my provissions groweth short, and I cannot continue myself upon the coast not above 18 or 20 daies longer at furthest without a supplye of provissions, and further I desire your Worship and Councells order for the time that I shall lye upon the coast in purchaseing of slaves above charter party mentioning. I shall make all the dispatch I can in filling of my water and I desire your Worships answer of this in tyme of watering."
584,1,584,James Nightingale/Robert Hollings,Wyamba,Edgar,Cape Coast Castle,07/05/1681,Transatlantic Voyage,RAC,"This conveyance brings the several coppyes of what wee wrotte you upon the receipt of yours mentioning the unfortunate loss of the 15 hand canoe etc. Per ours to your honour at that time you will find how affaires where with us at that time. According to the dates of them wee have expected some answer, for the want of which Captain Bowler is very impatient, not knowing what it may meane, and likewise his provissions growing very short he is compelled to depart the coast. Wee have desired of ditto Bowler this morning how long he intends to stay for answer from your Honour, he replyed that in his letter bearing date the 25th ultimo he hath signified his mind, the limitt of which time he is resolved not to exceed now, fearing that his with our letters of the same date may not come to hand. Wee have this possitive answer from him, that within 5 dayes from this date he intends for Accra and there to land the remaines, soe go off the coast with those Negroes that are on board, Mr Nightingale having refused to take the goods ashore at this place, it beeing as he sayes besides his orders to doe it. Wee have been heere this last time about 11 or 12 dayes. Indeed our trade gives but little incoura[ge]ment, wee having purchased few slaves. The Queen of Anguinna came to this towne on Thursday last, has promised the payment of some part of her debt to the Roy all Affrican Company of England, and as the Negroes say is ready with her pawnes for the settlement of a factory here. She likewise promises the best of her indeavour for procuring slaves.
She hath allready done this for us (there being an English interloper who came down here the 4th insten, one Richard Lumley Commander) to put one of the natives in irons at the factory, for sending a slave aboard of him, and has commanded that he be put one board of us. Wee have had an ill accident befalling us aboard, which is the loss of a hogshead of our Negroe brandy, and likewise a great part of our Negroe bread has been throwne over board since wee came here, it being old bread when bought in England as may be beleeved, and not fitt for use. There is absolute necessity for a recruite of brandy for the Negroes, without which if wee depart the coast it may be the loss of many of our Negroes in the voyage. This being the needfull wee humble desire your Honour may be pleased to send us a speedy answer."
585,1,585,James Nightingale,Wyamba,Edgar,Cape Coast Castle,07/05/1681,Transatlantic Voyage,RAC,"At my coming downe here found a shoare a person by name Nicholas Bartrell, whome came from Accra under protection of our flagg desiring your honour be pleased to entertain him in servis of the Company or else to give him his discharge, as he sayes Mr Wendover denied him the same, hee being lodged at a blackes house. I desire your Honours order what to doe in itt."
586,1,586,James Nightingale,Wyamba Road,Edgar,Cape Coast Castle,11/05/1681,Transatlantic Voyage,RAC,"Your Honours and Councells much esteemed dated the 6th and 11 of Aprill, allso the 3rd and 7 instant received: wherein I understand your Honours great care and indulgency in ordering me to dispatch Captain Bowler with his complement of slaves. This is to answer that I have done my utmost indeavour and will continue in the same practise. As to our progress at this place, wee have had noe more than 3 slaves, interlopers lyeing here to windward and leward hinders us much.
The Queene being heare as I wrote your honour before hath promised to us some part of her debts, allso pawns for the factory, and to procure slaves, the two first I am certaine but the last I question much to procure as many slaves as wee want. She promise faire but they are blackes, I give them but little beleeve. I doe ashure your honour I will doe my uttmost indeavour. Your honour has been pleased to mention that there was suficient suply of goods sent before, you will find that I will give your honour and Councell a good and just account of what received, sould and remaines when I come to Cape Corsoe.
I shall according to your honours order dispose of noe more goods for gold then will procure slaves. Your honour has been pleased to mention of our progress at Alampa, itt being small incouragement for our Company, and that in all that time I gott but 140 slaves. [I] answer pray consider what ships has been there and the rates they have given, you will finde I have done my indeavour. I am of the same opinion that interlopers will be prevented to come to Guiny by their own imployers when the day of account comes. Your honour has been pleased to mention of the 7 instant that you dayly expected what success wee had at Wyamba. I have given your honour a full account the same day per our 2 hand canoe, also that Captain Bowler will stay noe longer then 5 dayes after the same date. I have showne your honour and Councells order to Captain Bowler that he should not goe of the coast, with[out?] his slaves or thereabouts, if did it was upon his own account. I doe beleeve ditto Bowler rights to your honour himselfe. He has the 2 letters, one to the Company, the other to Mr Steed and Mr Gascoyne. Being sworne one of your honours Councell to be true to our masters the Company, am bound to follow the same. Your honour will finde per attestation my meaning. I take God Allmighty to wittness I would doe noe man any rong, but instead, would take his place. I give your honour and Councell humble and harty thankes that you have been pleased to lay your commands upon me; there shall be nothing wanting what my meane capassity can procure. If wee stay heere shall want musquetts, but especially tapseeles, and as for giving your honour and Councell a certain account of what slaves to procure in such a time or such a time [I] can not doe itt, when I was heare last with the Portugueese [I?] gott 58 slaves in one months time. Pray lett the rest of the out factorys send what slaves they have.
The sea running here mighty high, the 2 hand canoe could not goe before, nor can I gitt well aboard. In the meane time I doe what I can, gott this day 2 girl slaves, part of the Queens debt."
587,1,587,Charles Bowler,Wyamba Road,Edgar,Cape Coast Castle,11/05/1681,Transatlantic Voyage,RAC,"The ocasion of my writing unto you is that I understand by Mr Nightingales letter from your Worship that you doe intend to detain me heare at Wyamba untill I have my full complement of slaves, which I doe want at present about one 120, for I have a areyfd [sic: = arrived?] at this place 15 dayes and wee have goten but 3 slaves in all this time and therefore I thinke it impossible for to gett [them] here if wee laye here this 3 months longer, for the Queene and the Atta is come downe from Anguina to this place, and I doe not heare of any slaves that they brought with them, and if you will force me to stay for my full complement you must to gett them your selfe or at the other factoryes, for here they are not to be gotten, and I must needs tell you I have not above 4 months provissions left in my ship and therefore I cannot stay much longer nor will not, weather you give me my dispatches or not, for I have fulfilled my demorage dayes in charter party and 20 dayes more besides and our Negroes corne spends apace to. Wee have had a great mischance aboard concerning a hogshead of Negro brandy which is leaked out and wee shall want it very much for them, and farther I doe acquint your Worshipp that some of our Negroes hath goten the small pox and the longer wee stay I feare will be worse."
588,1,588,Charles Bowler,Wyamba,Edgar,Cape Coast Castle,15/05/1681,Transatlantic Voyage,RAC,"Yours I have received dated the 9th instant, and as for going to Accra I was intended for heare. We have been at Wyamba 19 dayes and purchased noe more then 6 slaves and wee have had 7 dead aboard, and therefore I think it will be little proffitte either for Company or owners of our lying heare, having noe assistant from your honour or from any othere factoryes, and as to my provissions I brought anough with me if you had complyed with charter party. As you say I complaine of a months time of demorage, but the Company will find 45 dayes from this deat; and as for my going to Arda I am very free to [do so] with a provisor I might have my complement of slaves, but how they will be gotten without goods I know not, and for me to goe from place to place to be lead by the nose as I have been allready, I am quite aweary of it. If your honour had send goods for Arda there might be some hopes of purchasing of them, for Captain Bell lay a considerable time for want of goods to buy his slaves, and I dont understand how wee shall gett them without goods to. I am willing to goe downe to Arda for the rest of our slaves, for they are not to be had heare at Wyamba, but I desire your honours order for what quantity of time I shall stay at Arda if slaves to be had, if not to depart the coast.
[PS] I hope your honour will not be unmindful of a hogsheads of brandy for our Negroes, for there is a great necessity for itt."

My humble desire is that you would be pleased send your possitive order what I shall doe with the remaines of the Companys merchandies, eather to put them ashore heare or att Accra. Alsoe if Captain Bowler goes to Arda if I should consigne ditto Bowler to Edwin Steed and Stephen Gascoyne Esquires, the Companyes factors at Barbadoss, with those slaves he has on board or not, I being very dubeous in this case because your honour has ordered me before not to dispatch him before he had 300 slaves or there about or else your possitive order.
I have given Captain Bowler your Honours 3 letters, and sent yesterday the 2 before. As to your Honours of the 10 instant I shall do my endeavour for Captain Bramfill after Captain Bowler is gone from me according to order. In answer of your Honours of the 12 instant shall acte for my masters good as much as possible can. In the 9 hand canoe will send Nicholas Bartrell, which departs tonight.

Captain Bouler intends to sayle for Accra this night, there to land the remains and soe to sayle for Arda. I have given him the letter to Mr Goulding.

Per the bills of ladeing and the account, your Honour will perceive how many received on bord at all places, out of which are deceased in all 19, vizt 8 males and 11 females, of which number 6 were received from Cape Coast Castle, and 1 from Accra. In the account your Honour will find to be short in the tapseels 11 pieces, I doe sweare I saw noe more, not 1 piece than specified in the account, and beleive that they came not on bord. I wish Mr Bridge had taken receipt (as the usuall manner is) for the goods so put on board, then the error would have been manifested with ease, of the sort of goods many came loose on bord, all the other answering the invoice, except the afore menconed tapseels. Your Honour etc. may perceive by the severall letters sent you that slaves were not easily purchased where we have been, and truly I am glad we have so many on bord, which had not been purchased had not Mr Nightingale been acquainted with the coast and likewise industrious in this affair.

Now wee intended for Ophra to put the remaines on shoare. Wee have left Mr Thorne and Robert Chapman with the remaines of the goods wee had ashoare att that place [= Whidaw], the King haveing such a desire to have a factory settled there, and finding itt something dubious to gett the goods off without some time, the ship being leakey, we told the King [we] would referr the further settleing of itt till further order.
Our oppinion in itt is that itt will very much advance the Companys interest, by the great quantity of slaves that is to be had from that place, and the great awe to Ophra, who att present slites our English factory and nation and dus not allow halfe the libberty to us as to the Dutch, provided that that factory be accountable to Ophra (and dependant upon that), besides the better convenience for getting of water for shipping and not above 6 leagues from Ophra.
Now if this concor with your prudience itt will be convenient that you send downe another man to Mr Thorne whoe is an accountant."

The King is up in the country and sent one of his men downe to tell the Captain he would come downe shortly with slaves, but there being very little money wee thought not worth the while of staying any longer, yet I doe beleeve that if a factory were setled here there might be good store of slaves procured, and in time might be a place of good trade.
I greatly feare that wee shall be put to a nonplus in procuring of our slaves, for nothing goes off wth us, but sayes, perpetuanoes, sheets and some tapsells. Paut-keys, fine clouts and committers wee have not sold one since wee left Cape Corso roade.

I have made all the inquiry I can here, and from Lague have notice there is noe less then a 11 hand canoe to bee had there, and to goe downe without one will be verry uncertaine of being furnished there, for every man will serve himselfe first in such cases, and besides because of the abundance of shipping that I suppose to lye there now, I shall not make too much hast downe to the factory if can find any prospect without any long stay on this side of itt to be furnished. As to my corne, of the complement that that you ordered Mr Thelwall to deliver mee there is about 6 chests lost, the canoe sinking goeing off.

I am verry glad to heare of your health, which God continue and send you safe to England where, since it cannot conveniently be here, I hope I may have the Honour of your company. In the interim soe neare as I can remember concerning Agga Annamaboe etc. are as followeth. In June 16671 arrived att Cabo Corsoe Castle, att which time wee had warr with the Dutch, then finding Agga demolisht and in said warr Annamaboe deserted, and being courted by the natives of both places to settle, finding them to be much for the Companys interest did send whitemen and house slaves to both places. Some time after I had severall threatnings from the Dutch that if I did not deliver the possession of the said places, they would gaine them by force of armes. That not takeing effect in greate grandure they protested; that was answered; still they protested, in protesting three times, and at last [we] not submitting to their threatnings, Dirick Willree the Generall made an offer to remitt the differance to the King of England and their States, which I submitted to and sent all my papers relateing to that differance to the Royall Company and the Company presented them to his Majestie in Councill. William Temple was then goeing into Holland on some other state affaires and his Majestie gave him to understand how ill hee resented the illegall proceedings of their Agents abroad. The Embassadour att his arrivall in Holland made knowne his Majesties pleasure in that particular to the States Generall, whoe immediately commanded the West India Company that they should give orders to their Agents, in noe hostile manner to disturb what interest the English nation was possest of in the time of warr, and from the Royall Company I had express commands not to relinquish a foot of ground that were then possest of, and from that time till this present I never had any dispute therein. In [16]68 from Succondee, Asshume and the Cabosheers sent downe and desired that our nation might settle att that place. I found by severall ships that had been there itt was a place verry considerable for trade and verry good landing, on which I sent Captain Cockram and another Whiteman with some quantity of goods, they stayed 8 or 10 day's, and left some of our black servants in charge of the goods, whoe sold considerable quantityes and were from time to time supplyed with what the trade required. Some of our factors every 10 or 14 dayes were there, and Asshume had the Companys flagg. The Dutch then nor before ever had any settlement or people att that place. Att Dickiscove wee found greate conveniency for corne, wood and water, especially in time of warr with the Dutch, whereupon I made a contract with Dick that for every ship that wooded, watered and corn'd att that place hee should have one perpettuanoe and one anchor of brandy, and for demanding the same I gave him a paper under my hand, and sent him a flagg, noe Dutch ever haveing had any pretentions to that place. If anything I have in my ship be serviceable to you pray with all freedome command itt."

637,1,637,John Lowe,Ouidah,Merchant Bonaventure,Cape Coast Castle,10/06/1683,Transatlantic Voyage,RAC,"I am sorry I am forct to give you this sad account of our misfortune att this place, for the 16th of May past about 5 in the evening came down 2 pyrates, the one of 28 guns the other of 24, which ship shee tooke on the coast to windward and man'd out of his ship. The admirall clapt our ship aboard and after fireing many broad sides and valleys of small shott supprized our ship, the slaves on the deck 150 and my caske to cleare my hold. Come with the King's jack, ensigne and pennant, wounded 7 of my men, although they made no resistance. Entered 150 men. My mate cutt the cable, upon which hee cutt his and then laid her aboard upon the luff, att which time my people yeilded the ship. Captain Rickards his people cutt their cable and loosed the fore topsaile and put to the shoare, but before shee came ashoare, quited the ship, tooke out the gold and lett the ship and slaves drive ashoare, the which is lost and not one thing saved out of her. Captain Woollifords men quited their ship and left their gold aboard, the which the pyrates found all the next morning and an English woeman and the cooke. Att this action Captain Rickards, Woolliford and my selfe in the country purchaseing our slaves, which Woolliford might have had his slaves long before but much disobliged the blacks, though hee raised the price of booges att least 10 pounds in a slave, and told the Blacks that I was comeing downe which made them keepe their slaves for mee, which I had 150 aboard and 150 ashoare, but not goods ashoare to pay for them, and I was to be dispatcht in 9 dayes more had this not happened, but now my ship is soe much disabled that I feare shall hardly carry her to the Indias, all my low masts shott, soe that all the fishes and provisions I can make will hardly hould, all but 3 shrouds on one mast and 5 on the other gon, my foremast shott; [they have] taken all my sailes, good provisions, cordage, armes and powder with all my cloaths, gold and what was proper for them as they thought of the Company goods, as allejars, chercolees, pintado's, attlases, muzlin; and what booges on my deck and in my boate to goe ashoare, which was 6 caske, [they] throwes overboard. The next day they seized all my officers to the gunnell to shoote to death to confess for more gold, but only shott my gunners mate to death, and the other which was prevented by the English pyrates that was aboard, otherwise all the rest had dyed. Captain Rickards hath used much dilligence in looking after his gold, which was carried by his men and boate to Ofra aboard the Flemings, but broake open and greate part of itt divided amongst them, and on the news to the Flemings two of them weighed and most of his men gon with them. Hee hath gotten part of it againe and 28 marks sent home to the Company per Captain Woolliford, who sailed 2 dayes since. I have now 423 slaves on board on the Companys account and 25 on my mens account, for when the pyrate had quited the ship and had watered his ship out of her, my men desired him to give them something towards their loss, upon which hee gave them my ship, goods and slaves for their owne proper use, and ordered them that if I agreed to itt they should fire 7 gunns, if not att 8 the next morning hee would come aboard and burne her, upon which the next morning they demanded my ship, goods and slaves and to gett her to St Thoma and sell her and divide the money. I answered that itt was not in my power to give nor theirs to receive, but if they would goe about their business and refitt the ship I would find out some way to consider their loss, upon which I told them I would gett creditor for 25 slaves and send for the Factor off, whoe should allow itt and give the Company an account, and that I beleeved 25 slaves would make good all their, loss and desired them to consider whether or noe that was not a safer way, then to be like the pyrates, upon which after many disputes they fired 7 guns, and after the man of warr weighed after haveing been here 4 dayes, soe that I sent for Mr Winder aboard and satisfied him of the thing and hee told them hee would assist them with a letter to the Company to that purpose, upon which they went to worke and in 12 day's time I gott my ship in a pretty good condition and went ashoare againe. In which time Captain Woolliford bought all his slaves but how many I cannot tell. His ship was only taken by 3 prisoners which the pyrate sent aboard and brought the White woeman and the cooke and all the gold aboard. Hee saith hee hath lost greate quantity of goods, but I am sure he hath much abused Mr Winder and pretends all that goods that you sent downe to his factory is lost, and had not Captain Rickards and my brother Woolman left him [= Winder] something could not have supported. Hee hath been verry dilligent in getting part of Captain Rickards gold and my slaves, and now recovered of his sickness very serviceable to the Company. The people of this place are verry kind to him and hee obliges them well, but itt is my opinion that if you doe not send for the time forward as many ships to Ophra as this place the Companys trade will be spoyled, for after our loss when wee brought the remaines of goods ashoare the blacks plundered as well as the pyrates and could gett no satisfaction of them, and the people of Ophra att this time doe promise that if you will send ships there wee shall have a good trade, and I well know there the prizes are settled and 20 per cent less then here, for they grow upon every ship here, soe that if you think convenient to lett Mr Winder goe there and order a seacond or more to that factory and 2 or 3 to this, the two places will strive to outvey the one the other. Your advice to us came 12 houres after our ships was taken, and they stayed by the way att a place called Abrew, some 18 leagues to windward of this place, where Captain Wyborne was getting of slaves for Captain Booth, and that they went on board Captain Booths ship, which gave the pyrate notice that they were a canoe for advice, upon which the pyrate weighed after them and outsailed, otherwise might have had 24 houres notice, for itt was the 17th day of May they came down and your letter of 5 dayes date.
If my brother Thompson and brother Collins be with you pray remember my love to them and tell them I would have them goe home, for their ship and goods is given to the merchant of the greate Fleming the pyrate tooke, and about 2,000 pounds worth of goods more, and that the merchant promis'd mee to goe for Holland and that he would send the ship and her concerns for England to the owners.

639,1,639,Thomas Woolman,Sao Tome,Jacob,Cape Coast Castle,25/08/1683,Transatlantic Voyage,RAC,"This comes per Captain Smith, a Dutch Ship belonging to the Mina, to informe you of my proceedings. May the first I came downe to Guydah. What has happened since, till the 14th day of June ditto, I referr you to my brother Lowes and Mr Winders letter,  which day my brother and I sailed and the 22nd ditto wee come  to Princes, where wee found Captain Woolliford. The Governour plaid the knave with my brother and I verry much, for hee would not suffer my brother to buy any refreshment untill I had paid a slave custome. The 29th ditto I saild in company with my brother and that night parted with him, and the 8th of July I came into the Gabboone, and the Prince came aboard of mee from a small island and 7 more men, and shewed mee a letter from Captain Anthony Weilden which informed mee that the Prince and the natives were verry civill. I sent a man ashoare while they was aboard, and hee came off and told mee that there was but one man more upon the island. They told mee that the island was the cheifest place of trade, and bid mee fire 2 gunns to give the country people notice. The next day they came aboard and brought a small parcell of teeth and wax with them, which I bought att a reasonable rate, but they told mee I must not expect the trade to be open in less then 2 or 3 dayes. I intended to stay that time there, and then to goe further up the river. I thinking noe harme went ashoare with 3 men more, they treaded mee kindly att the first, but after I had been ashoare about 2 hourse, att my comeing away they panyard mee and all the men and beate and cutt us verry much, wee all looking for nothing but death. After a small time [we asked] why they did soe, they answered that they must have all my slaves and goods, and that an English ship had been there and burnt their towne and kill'd 2 men and carryed off 13 more. I told them that the goods were none of mine and that I could not give them away, but I seeing that here was about a 100 people upon the island that was come over from the maine in a small time, fear'd that they would goe and take the vessell, there being noe more then my mate and one man and a boy aboard. I sent for the slaves and 40 iron barrs and a bunch of beades, but I haveing neither pen nor paper my mate mistooke and sent a chest of beades. After these goods were ashoare, for when they came first aboard I shewed them all my goods, they would have my powder and musketts, kettles, pintado's, booges, soe I sent for 10 kettles, 10 pintado's, 30 musketts, 1 barrell of powder, 3 plaines. After this they would have all the teeth that I bought of them and wax and severall other small things, and after they had kept mee 24 houres, they lett mee goe. I staid three dayes att the rivers mouth to see if I could gett any Negro's off there, but could not. The 21 st ditto I came to an anchor att Cape Lopas, where I found my brother Lowe, Captain Booth and Captain Howe and a Fleming bound for Angola to take in 500 slaves. My brother and Captain Rickards was verry well but has mett with a greate mortallity with his slaves. The 23rd ditto my brother sailed. There is noe trade, for the Negro's sayes that here has been 30  or 40 saile of ships within this 3 months. They told mee that the privateere were here 6 weeks past with 7 saile in company with him. The 25th ditto there came one Captain Serjant that came out of the Bite, and he inform'd mee that Captain Davis was dead and a greate many of his men, and that hee had but 50 slaves in when hee came away. This Serjant is an interloper and was panyard att the Gabboones 9 dayes before mee, and that they made him pay to the vallue of 150 pounds in teeth and goods, before they lett him goe, upon which Captain How and I agreed to goe downe againe to see if I could recover satisfaction. The 26th wee sailed and mett Captain Clarke, but wee put him to a greate deale of charge, for hee tooke us to be the pyrate. Captain Thompson has tooke his passage upon Captain Howe. The 22nd [sic] ditto I came to an anchor att the rivers mouth and went up the river in Captain Howe. The 30th ditto the Prince and about 30 people more came aboard, and after they had been a small time aboard I came in sight and wee panyard the Prince and 8 men more and killed and wounded 10, and the rest leap'd over board. We kept then 6 dayes and I have gott all my owne slaves and part of my goods, but could not possibly gett all by reason of itt's being distributed up in the country, but I have gott 4 slaves and 160 weight of teeth besides my own teeth for the goods and wee lett the Prince and 2 more goe. The 11th of August I came to an anchor att Cape Lopas againe, where I found Captain Lumley's pink, but hee has been dead this 15 dayes. They have a parcell of verry good slaves and has buried but 2 since they came off the coast. The 13th ditto waid againe and the 17th ditto came unto St Thoma, where Captain How and I was clapt in prison under the pretence of our selling goods and not paying the Kings custome, but I understand better since, for they would force Captain Howe to take his provisions of the Governour and Captain and att what price they would, but I was quickly lett out againe, but Captain Howe they made him come to their price. Since I have been here I understand there has been 2 Portugeeze taken at the Gabboones after the same manner as I was, one had 60 slaves and the other 9 and they tooke all from them both and then lett them goe. I hope to find a better trade att Sherbera to make up my loss time, for neither att the Gabboones nor Cape Lopas is there any trade, soe I hope your honour will not think ill of [me].

This accompanies the Coast Friggat, Captain John [sic: = Henry] Wood, who arrived here the 30th July, being in want of provitions, wood, water & ca., which I have supplyed him with as per the inclosed receipt, for which I make your Factory debtor."
644,2,4,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,16/01/1686,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships I received, with the knives, rangoes, and corrall, which I will dispose of to the best advantage I can. As for the warehouse, I shall be as carefull as posible may be. As for what ships are to windward, I am informed by Captain John Woodfine there is a French man, and a Dutch interloper, and three other which he could not give an account of. I have heard no news of the Mary as yett; as soon as I can heare of her, I shall deliver your Worships letter and informe your Worship thereof. As for my December account I would have sent with my November, but was continuously troubled with [ms 'wt'] the canoe men and the blacks though their business was of noe account, [so] that I could not have time to write them all out; I haveing one write, could not perswade Mr Innes to tarry till I write the other out. I would have sent them now, but durst not trust the canoe men with the mony. Of the occasion of my writing at the present, is to informe your Worship of the death of Robert Chappie, who died the 15th instant. Mr Baily presents his servis to your Worship, and desires a corker [= caulker], if there be any to be spared; a Munday he hopes to heave up her keel, and desires to informe your Worship he is in good health and hath been soe ever since he hath been here. John Veasey is very ill, and am affraid we shall loose him; soe is Mr Hilling but I hope he will recover. The othere sleepes night and day, ask him how he doth he saith very well, butt I beleive he is ill and is not sensible of it. Captain Assumes wants his Chrismas cloth."
645,2,5,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,18/01/1686,Fort,RAC,"I received your letter by Bastian Ferdinand, whome I sent aboard Mr Baily, who wisheth he had a corker in his stead, but he will make the best shift he can. Mr Helling is indeferently in health againe; but John Veasey is little better, lying and sleeping continually. Here is two Fflemish interlopers in the road; but I cannot here [= hear] any news of the Mary yett, neither by blacks nor them. Shortly we shall want blew [= blue] perpetuanoes, tallow, narrow nicconees. Pray send me waits [= weights] and scales, to weight the beads, for we have sorts the Dutch hath not, which I know not how to sell; also the weight of the whole chest, otherwise if part be sold know not how to charge it in my accompt; also how many chests of come was in those caske[s] sent me last and what the quarter caske of oyle contains, with the price of both. I have sent my December accompt by the canoe, but the mony I durst not trust. 3 marks was paid Mr Humfryes at Christmas; the remaynes I will send per first conveyance. The Capusheres of the twon [= town] are desireous of Cophee and would not be sattisfied till I write, proffering to send a canoe themselves, with the letter."
646,2,6,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,22/01/1686,Fort,RAC,"I have by this canoe sent downe Robert Stone, who is uncapeable of doeing Mr Bayley anye servis by reason of sickness. Mr Bailey presents his servis to your Worship, and will make what expedition he can in creening [= careening] his vessell, one side being done, by reason of the sea being so great could not finish the other. Pray send me as soon as possible may be some blew perpetuanoes, narrow nicconees, and tallow, which would goe off dayly, though I have but small trade, it being rowsawing time yet. We have had a very sickly time amongst us: when one is up another is down, Mr Chambers haveing had a violent fitt of vomitting and loossness but is sometimes cheary at present, Mr Hilling [and] John Veasey being sometimes well other times ill. As for my selfe I make shift to keep indiferent well. 21st instant a French man of war of 28 gunns anchored here; the Lieutenant, marchant and purser came a shoar, who say the ship was given the French Company by the king of France, to clear the coast of pyrates, who he was informed wore the French flagg. The Captain[s] name is Monseur Lefebree, who knowes your Worship very well, as they say; the Captain presents his servis to your Worship, and designs to be at Cabo Corso very spedily. They have a letter from Mr Platt to your Worship, who lyes at Cape Appelonia; but I cannot hear of the Mary, nor none but another French ship of 24 gunns to windward, only [= except] 3 Fflemish interlopers in this roade. I have also sent a broken maule which would desire your Worship to order another as big againe to be sent in the rome of it. I have turned out the Cape Coast canoe men; for they would give me ill language and would not work, [so] that the slaves has played for want of stones; soe have gott 9 Succondee men, for 4a 3 men per turne, willing men who will help the slaves fetch the stones, which the other would not. Now the others would work, but I will not lett them; if I should turn them [= the Sekondi men] out, and they [= the Cape Coast men] fall to their old tricks I should gett none; now they are contented to work when the others are done. If your Worship would have them down pray send by the next. The slaves work stoutly, and use stone very fast, for the which I am glad I have 4 [sic] Succondee men to supply them."
647,2,7,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,28/01/1686,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys Joseph Collenwood, who came in a canoe from Cape Treespintas, from the Generall of the Branburgers, haveing laine their a week before he could gett any canoe, which cost 4a which I have paid. He informes me that Mr Platt is carried away by the pyrate and 4 men panyard by the Negroes, the rest he left at Axim. He said he heard aboard the pyrate that the Mary fought him at Cestos, but she shot his mayn mast, which occasioned him to leave her. For further news I refer to Joseph Collenwood, who can better informe your Worship. Pray send some nicconees, tallow, sheets, boysadoes, and blew perpetuanoes. By next opertunity will send my January account. I have bought a man slave for 7 peas which you will receive per the canoe. Our fforte goes very well forward and will goe ffaster when the sloops are gon. We want another maul. We are in a sickly condition amoungst us, Mr Hilling haveing the yallow janders [= jaundice]; as for myselfe very well in health. The Capusheers makes a palaver for Cophe, so doth the Idoom people, who all know him as I beleive. The Capusheers desire him upon their account, for they came to me for a letter to your Worship, and they would send a canoe themselves for him. Pray send Captain Assumes cloath."
648,2,8,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,30/01/1686,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships is received with the nicconees and tallow, whereof 9 nicconees is damaged. As for the forte we will forward as fast as possible may be. I incourage the slaves what I can to gett it up before the rains, which they p[r]omise to effect, they haveing used their indeavour very well heitherto, but we shall want bricks and lime very quickly, also three trouells and 100 large staples for the canoe, and nayles for the carpenters, 100 single [ms. 'signle'] tenns and as many double tenns. As for goods I want sheets, boysadoes and blew perpetuanoes, broad tapseiles. Perpetuanoes I could put of one blew one green, which I could not doe before, the Dutch haveing none nor none to supply him at the Mine. I have almost a chest of sheets left, which are most damnified, and the rest is soe course [= coarse] they will scarce pass but for damaged sheets, all of them almost comeing in one of the last chests sent me; some may pass when I have better to mix with them, but as they are they will not take one. As for news to windward I hear none but what your Worship already knows of, only Mounser Leffebree who lies at Commenda, whom I write to your Worships of, he is suspected to be confeding with the pyrate, to sell his goods [which] he takes from other ships, I being informed he sold English goods at Commenda. I have write to Mr Cross what I heard, that he might make what inquirey he could, and give your Worship information thereoff. Mr Bayley hath clean'd his vessell, and stayes but for the creening one side of the Ann Sloope, before he comes down; he hath sent down the other white carpenter, being very sick [so] that he was afraid of buriing him here. Pray send me some rum and paper, also the qantity and price of the corne and palm oyle sent me last, otherwise I know not how to charge it. I have sent down the letter for Mr Carter by Captain Petter. The people are glad of Cophes coming up. Captain Assume makes a pallaver for his cloth."
649,2,9,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,02/02/1686,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships of the 30th of January is received and have inquired what I could after the pyrate, all the news I can hear of him is buy a Portugues who arrived here last night and informes the sames [sic] pyrate hath taken 5 ships upon the coast of Brazell, one being loaded with plate, there being seaven Ffathers aboard whom killed and saved all the rest of the men. He saith he se noe ships to windward but the French mans consorte and his tender. The pyrate is suspected to begon down to Ardra. I have sent down Collin Hunter, according to your Worships order. I would have sent my Januarys accounts, but they departing soe suddenly affter my month was up, I could not gett them ready. By the next returne of sloop or canoe I shall not faill to send them. I sent down one markes, four ounces, three angles, and four taccoes of gold by Mr Innes, which with three marks already received by Mr Humfryes is the ballance of my December account. Mr Chambers desires your Worship to order the windows for the lower rooms to be done as fast as they can. Pray send those necessaryes both for the fforte and ffactory, mentioned in my last letter."
650,2,10,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,08/02/1686,Fort,RAC,"I have received your Worships letter per the Ann Sloope, also by Mr Bayley. Likewise the goods for the ffactory, and other necessarys for the forte. Mr Chambers presents his servis to your Worship, and will husband the lyme and bricks as well he can. For bricks we shall doe pretty well, but lyme we shall want a good quantity more, though we use it but for the outside. Also thirty scaffold poles, and the best of the old timber for lintles for the windows, which is all the timber we shall want, till the uper floor be ready; then we shall want nine girders of 26 foot long, which since lyme is scarse will be convenient to lay across the fforte and crampt at each end with iron, which will be a great strength to it, if your Worship please to allow thereof. Pray send the windowes as soon as possible may be, also 200 of six penny nayles. We want blew perpettuanoes and more tapseiles, which would fetch a little mony, though we have but small trade and great charges of canoe hire. The merchants expects great dashes, the Dutch spoiles the trade by giveing a sheet in every bendy, which would desire your worship to consider of at leasure. As yett but few merchants comes till rowsawing time be over. I have sent my January account by Mr David Innes. also three marks, six ounces, eight angles, six taccoes, being the ballance of my account. I have sent two men one women slaves in three severall months, which I have noe receipts for, neither doe know who I ought to have it of, which I humbly desire your Worship to informe me of."
651,2,11,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,14/02/1686,Fort,RAC,"I received your Worships letter by Mr Innes with the bricks, lyme and timber and other necessaryes for the forte. For the windows we were forced to use some of the old ones, else we should have tarryed for them. We should have been forwarder, but the sea hath been soe bad, that we have had noe stones fetcht this week, which occasioned us to use more of the old stones then we were willing. As for the 9 girders I write for, Mr Chambers saith he thought to use noe jeyce [=joist?] at all if had them, but if your Worship dislikes thereof he leaves it to your Worships discression. Pray order three door cases and the windows for the upper roomes to be got ready, also some rope to tye the scaffold poles. As for goods I want only iron barrs and white beads. Here is an old girder that was put up in the last forte, which the carpenter saith is not fitt to be put up in this. The girder is very bad, that is true, but Mr Chambers is for haveing it up; for my own part I doe not much approve of it, but if better cannot be conveniently spared it may serve. As for the complaint I made of the carpenter in my last letter, he still continues in his obstinancy, doeing nothing but what he listeth himselfe."
652,2,12,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,17/02/1686,Fort,RAC,"This accompany Mr Chambers, by whome I have sent a sample of white and yellow beads, which is all the sortes are vendible here, especially the white. The samples would have gone by Mr Innes but he hastened away so fast for fear of a turnado, that he went without them. As for other goods I want only sheets. What is wanting for the forte Mr Chambers will inform your Worship. The carpenter hath been very mild ever since he received a check from your Worship, but before their was no rest in the ffactory for him."
653,2,13,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,19/02/1686,Fort,RAC,"I am forced to be at the charge of a canoe, to render your Worship an account of our hinderances in building the fforte, ffirst through bad seas that we could gett noe stone, and now through carelessness of the canoe men, who have staved the canoe all to peices. We have used all the old stone which was good, and question not but to have lay'd the floor all by Tuesday next at ffarthest, which had been done before, could we have been supplyd with stone. I would desire your Worship to render us advice what we shall doe with all the convenent speed, for haveing noe stone cannot tell at present. Mr Chambers present his servis to your Worship and desires some more lyme and bricks; if there be noe bricks, also desires liberty to come down a Satterday affter the floors lad [= laid] and come up a Sunday night. Yesterday a Pourtugees passed by with a Governer aboard for the Island Princes. Here is a Dutch interloper in the roade, and one at Dicks Cove newly come upon the Coast."

Also sheets, I desire your Worship to supply me with as soon as may be, for I have none. The canoemen I have order'd to goe down in the sloope, 5 that came with the 7 hand and 4 of the old canoemen, which I have paid here, their being 27 turnes due to them. I would a [= have] given your Worship a ffull account but the wind blowing ffresh Mr Innes feard a turnadoe, soe would not tarry. By Mr Chambers I shall send ffurther advice."
655,2,15,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,04/03/1686,Fort,RAC,"The ocassion of my writing at present is to give your Worship an account that the French man that hath lay soe long to windward is noe better then a pyrate by all signs that may be, for here lay a Dutch interloper in the road, who seing him comeing about the point, weighed in the night and stood of [= off] to sea, and the next day after he was gon, came into the road againe. The Ffrench man came to anchor of Taggeradoe under Flemish coulors, were [= where] he tarried not above four howers [= hours]. The blacks went aboard to buy goods but they had nothing to sell, but told them they were a Dutch ship. This day we saw him sayle to Shuma wearing French coullers, where he remayns at present. He is a ship of force, and the blacks say full of men, soe haveing all these suspicions of a pyrate I thought good to render your Worship advice thereof."

As for other materialls, we want none at present only boysadoes for the ffactory. As for my accounts I will send them down in the Ann sloop, for I had no paper to write them out till I received some per Mr Innes, otherwise your Worship had received them before. As for trade here is little, nor no better like to be as yet, as I can perceive. I set [sic] Cophe to inquire of the blacks why the Idoomes came not down, but he cannot understant the reason of it. All as I can understand the Idoomes have a pal laver with the people above them, which hinders their comeing down, but I am sometimes of the opinion they carry a fayr correspondence and make a shew of pease with the Antia people, and wait but for an opertunity to come down upon them as they did before. I am inform'd by the blacks that Captain Towers, the Dutch interloper, fought the pyrate to windward 3 dayes till his ship sunk under him, he escap'ding [sic] ashoar in his boat to the Brandyburgs forte w[h]ere he dyed, I have no certainty but what the blacks report.

As for ships I heard of none but your Worship hath had already advice of. Pray send me the jeyce and some more lyme with all the speed that may be. Mr Chambers hath bargained for oyster shells to be brought for 10ta a but and hath built a kill to burne them in the time the slaves lay idle for want of lime, being of opinion he can make lyme cheape here. He hath ventred as far as halfe an ounce, further he will not till he heres from your Worship, also he beleives they will not fetch wood reasonable.

I have filled up my account; also sent another duplycate, but could not charge the remaynes of the beads, not haveing an account what the first chest weigh'd.

I shall make bold to accept of your Worships grant to come when the Capushere is gon, leave the factory in trust with Collin Hunter for so short a time, I desireing but one dayes time their. I want green Welch playns, and Arda cloths haveing a stripe of blew and one of white which the Mine people sell for 14 per one ounce, and some rum.

As for necessaryes wanting for the forte, Mr Chambers can give your Worship an account thereof. The news is that Captain Towers is in Succondee roade. I sent aboard to know what ships was to windward and there is none but one English interloper. He sayes he did fight the pyrate, since he came from St Thoma, and killed six of their men, but received noe hurte himselfe nor noe of his men. He desire to know his servis presented to your Worship."
664,2,24,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,12/04/1686,Fort,RAC,"I have received your Worships letter per the Ann Sloop with sheets, boysadoes, carpitts, green perpetuanoes, knives, rum &ca mentioned in your Worships letter. The English interloper that lay to windward is arriv'd in this roade, being a sloop something bigger than the Adventure Sloop. He was fitted out of Jamaica but the master is a Barbarian [sic: = Barbadian], his name is Steet. He hath a great cargo aboard of all sorts of goods with a bundall of blew perpetuanoes, by which he takes all the trade from the shoar, the canoes being continually aboard of him, so that I can take nothing, but can receive by him noe intelligence of any of the Company ships nor noe other but one which he suspects to be the pyrate, which gave him chase but could not come up with him. Mr Chambers desires your Worship to order the remainder of the deal boards and as many bricks as the sloop can bring, the wether being so bad that we have had but little stone fetcht, also the two crows to be mended now sent down by the sloop, and the fflag and flagstafe to be sent.

He hath six and twenty seamen and tradesmen for the Castle and a chyrurgion [= surgeon], which are all goeing down in the George Sloop. There is two more Companyes ships to windward, which I suppose Captain Woodfine has given an account in his letter. I have had great hindrances of trade by reason of this interloper lying here, also am afraid of more by reason of one black at Yankees croom panyard an Idoom merchant which came down to buy goods and sold him aboard the interloper. The Idooms threatens to make war but what the isue of it will bee know not as yett. Captain Assum hath taken up the matter and saith he will end the pallaver. What further news I here of the matter will give an account per the An Sloop."
666,2,26,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,21/04/1686,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships of the 15th instant is received with the bricks and deal boards for the forte. Mr Wood arrived here the Fryday last but the interloper went to leward the day before, the blacks told me designed to lye at Commendo, which inform'd Mr Wood of but have heard nothing of him since. I have had but a very bad trade this month, their being ships continually in the road soe that I have not taken above a mark of gold, for the blacks will not buy anything at the factory as long as any ship be here. The Dutch hath had noe trade niether, haveing sold nothing but Portugues tobacco, but I question not but to have a good trade when the ship be past and the merchant[s] come down againe from carriing up their goods they bought aboard, for their hath been abundance of mony laid out this month with the ships, especially with the interloper who sold his goods for nothing in comparison to the prizes [= prices] of goods, he lying here continually from the time I have the first advise, till the day before Captain Woodfine [sic: = Wood?] came down which was Fryday last. Yanke at the croom came to me this day and desired me to write to your Worship, that if the Dutch interloper be taken or by any means the Idoom merchant could be recovered, which inform'd your Worship in my last letter was panyard and sold to him, he would give two slaves for him. Yanke hath given pawns for but the Idooms are not sattisfied with that but told him if he did not procure the merchant they would come down noe more tell they came to fight with him. Mr Chambers desires your Worship to send some more batts, tiles, 14 pieces small hinges and some thin whole deals for the window shutters, 10 peny and 6 peny nailes. I received an order per your last letter to sell sheets butt 28 per bendy which I canot do, the Dutch selling thirty two just buy me."

We shall want seaven hundred good sound tyles more for covering the forte, with more bricks batts, two thousand of 10 peny and 20 peny nailes six [penny?] singles [and?] quarters. As for trade I have none at present, there haveing been never a trader down since my last writeing, but there is some expected about four dayes hence. As for the order I writt of to sell sheetts but 28 per bendy, is certainly so in the postscript of your Worships letter of the 8th instant, which Mr Innes se as well as my selfe, but it might be a mistake in the writer. Cophe desires your Worship to give him leave to come down with the next returne of the sloop."

I have sent down my April account with one mark one ounce one angle and five taccoes of gold being the ballance thereof per Mr Innes, I haveing had noe trade at all their being never a trader come down since my last writing, the little mony I have been [= being] taken the first 4 or 5 dayes of the month. What the occasion should be of their not comeing down canot writely [= rightly] understand but I judge it to be some great pallaver in the cuntrey. I asked of Captain Assum the reason of it and he told me he heard by two Ancorsa people that the Idooms are preparing war with Antia, but he is not certain of it, nither doth he give much credditt to it, but I hope in a little time to have a better trade, or give your Worship a more true account of the reason of the contrary. As for news to windward I hear none. Captain Walker went down from hence to Comenda this day. I want some more sheets."
669,2,29,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,15/05/1686,Fort,RAC,"I have received your Worships letter per the sloop with those necessaryes for the forte mention'd therein. I have also mounted one of the gunns, but the other the carriage is all to pieces so could not mount it, but are ready for the rest as soon as your Worship pl[e]ases. As for men I know not how to bestow them at present till the house be a little more settled, then if your Worship thinks fitt a few more would be convenient. We shall want more for the forts use, twenty two pieces hooks and staples to hold the windows open, 500 of larg nailes with some oyster shells, here being much raine fallen of late, which hath washed down one of the flankers at the Dutch forte which compasseth in his yard and hath cract his house, [so] that I believe it will scarce stand another great raines, but ours hath received noe damage but remayns very firm and sound, which I think to put the goods into a Munday next, and remove myselfe as soon as may be. For news to windward I here none at present but only that unwelcome news of a bad trade remayns here still, which [is] occasion'd by a pallaver between the Idooms and Wassaws, report'd by a black which went up the cuntrey on purpose to here the pallaver, who saith that the last war the Wassaw had with Dunkeder a great Capushere of the Wassaws fled for safety to the Idooms and they killed him, for which they have been at difference ever since, and now the Wassaws are prepareing war, as they pretend war with the Anguers but the Idooms suspect it against them, so will not lett them pass through their cuntrey, which was the reason of our small trade and not the Idooms coming upon Antea as was report'd to Assum. Pray send me some sheets and Guinea stuffs per this first conveyance. Pray send some 6 peny nailes for the fort windows."
670,2,30,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,25/05/1686,Fort,RAC,"These is to give your Worship an account of the excessive rains that hath fallen ever since the 18th instant almost continually, it haveing washed the Dutch fort down to the ground last Wednessday morning, which made us very much afraid of ours, we not haveing wherewithall to secure it, but thanks be to God it remayns in safty, Mr Chambers haveing used what means he could to preserve it. We have also used all our lime and tiles [so] that we have not materialls to goe forward, wherefore we desire your Worship would be pleased to send some lime and tiles either by sloop or canoe, with all convenient speed, for fear of further danger, the weather continuing very lowring still. Pray send me some sheets and Guine stuffs, for want of which I have lost takeing 3 or 4 marks of gold. I humble desire your Worship would be pleas'd to send for Cophee for he is altogether deceitfull that I have noe trust in him, being again[s]t the Company intrest if it stands not with his own, which if he would be true noe man could doe more for their profitt in this place for he bears the whole sway in this town and rules them as he lists, but he is altogether false, therefore I could doe better without him, only I should want an interpreter for the cuntrey people. I would have sent him down myself once but he made his pallaver with the Cabusheers that they came to the factory, and told me he should not goe except I gave them a pawn. Captain Pickard arrived here in this road this night and came ashor with his boat and received an affront from the Negroes, he hath a man with him who was Captain Bells servant formerly, by whose order he panyard 4 ounces of gold from these people for a debt they owed him, for which they stop him now ashore and will not lett him goe of without the mony be paid them back againe, which is a great hindrance to the Captain, he being his gold taker, with severall affronts against the Company for which I would require satisfaction by force, when we are settle'd, if your Worship pleases to allow thereof, but I will first give account what the affronts are, which I wish I could doe by word of mouth, it being more sattisfaction than by writeing, but by the next opertunity I shall give a full account which I could not do at present, it being late when the pallaver happen'd and the canomen want to be dispatcht."
671,2,31,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,31/05/1686,Fort,RAC,"This accompanyes Mr Chambers who, understanding by Mr Innes canomen their was no lime aboard the sloop, could not be sattisfied without comeing down for the same. I have received your Worships letter per the cano with Captain Pickard, which I send down affter him to Commendo. Not long since their came two men about midnight to our factory to rob it as we suppose which is very probable was their intent, for they had noe business their at that time of night, but the carpenter overhearing them make their pallaver stept out with a musquet charged with small shot to se what they were, but as soon as they espi'd him they ran away, upon which he fired after them and shot one of them, by which the next day we knew him to be one of this town, so demanded of him what he want'd at that time of night about the factory. All he could plead was a great Capushere was buried their and he came to dig for gold which was buried with him, but all the blacks said that was a blind excuse, for none of them could remember any Cabusher being buried their, but however this fellow affter he was well out of reveng for his hurte, panyard two of our women slaves and was a carning them up to Axim to sell them, he being of that cuntrey although now inhabitent here, but was stopt by the Braffo of Tagarado. But in the meantime I went and made a pallaver with Captain Assume for the two slaves; he presently panyard one of his [i.e. the offender's] couzens, and gave me [him as] a pawn till I had the two slaves againe, which when I had was unwilling to deliver the man except I might have the ofender, which I perceive did affront Assum, so being unwilling to disoblidg him deliverd the man upon condition Assum should deliver me the ofender in eighteen dayes time, which is now expired, but perseive I am not like to have him of Assume. For ought [= aught] I know he may be the person hath stoln all the goods hath been lost, and therefore I think nothing but reason he should make sattisfaction, for they will not put up the least thing from us without amends, wherfore thought good to give your Worship this full account, as also desire advise whether I might take him my selfe or not. Pray send per first conveyance some iron barrs."
672,2,32,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,04/06/1686,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships per Mr Innes is received with the sheets and Guine stuffs, also those necessaryes for the fort mentioned therein. I sent down two old casks that came with the corne [which] was given the slaves; but for lime cask here is none, for they were always returnd with the return of the sloop, except one for measureing oystershells. I send down Mays account with one mark ten taccoes of gold, being the ballance thereof, per Mr Innes, which if I had had sheets and Guine stuffs I should have sent 8 or 9 marks, but the sloope arrivd not till they were gon up the cuntrey, but I question not but they will be down shortly, for sheets they bought of the Dutch, but Guine stuffs he could not supply them with, but I hope ere this month be past to have a good trade, for by that time the water will be abaite'd, which I understand are very high up the cuntrey. The goods I shall want is a hundred iron barrs and 6 chests of sheets. Allso if their be any blew perpetuanoes and broad tapseiles, to be spar'd out of the Castle, I desire your Worship to send me what quantity you please. Also powder would sell at one ounce per barrell, otherwise not by reason the Dutch sell it at that rate.

His bed remayns yet unsold, which I hope your Worship will be pleased to lett me have for 3 angles he owed me since his pay, with what hath been already paid will discharge his forty shillings advance mony and his seller debts. I have received the bread and beaf [= beef], for them I return your Worship all hearty thanks. I shall shortly have occasion for a sute [= suit] of cloths, which if your Worship have any stuff or good strong silk to sell would desire your Worship you would be pleas'd to lett me know it.

I have been importuned by Collen Hunter to speak for him to your Worship to grant him a Seconds place here, soe being troubled every day with his importunity have made bold to troble your Worship not for a Seconds place for him, which with your Worships leave I doe not desire, not as I can [say] any thing against his fidellity in the warehouse, but his proud temper, doubting he would be my master if he were advanced, but he understanding your Worship will send more men doth presume their will be a Serjants place, so desireing me if he could not be Second, that I would speak for the Serjants place, which if their be any such thing ordered if your Worships thinks him worthy of it I make bold to speak for him, though I am not very forward in it, knowing his pride, but upon his promise of amendment have done it, soe leaveing it to your Worships consideration beging excuse for thus troubleing your Worship."

Also pewter juggs and brass pans hath been inquir'd for, of which desire a dozen or two to se how they will vend. I made a bad month of May for want of part of these goods, but hope to make a better of this, being supplied with these goods this month; and being part of the rains over, and waters abated up the cuntrey, I doe expect a reasonable good trade, from the Ancorsa people, whose cheif trade is for these goods and powder if sold for an ounce per barrell, otherwise the Dutch will take that from me, but from the Idooms little is expected at present, they being still at difference with the Wassaws. Cophe is come down with the cano, but I was forced to pay him the last two months before he would goe, which I did to avoid mistrust, for he is very subtill, and if he had mistrusted in the least he would a brought the Capushers in a pallaver and pretend'd they would not lett him goe, also he demanding after my account was made up I could not charge it, so must defer it tell June account."

Powder vends indefferently but as yet canot advise for a suply, not haveing conveniency to secure it, but shall forward it with all expedition that may be. As for sayes are very bad comodity, but I humbly desire a full supply of those goods I last write of, with additions of 30 or 40 Welch playns and as many course sletias, and for sheets particularly I desire your Worship would not fail me, if a suply is to be had in the Castle, for all received last are gone and a great many more might have been disposed of I had had them, I being forcd to turn away two bendys this day for want of them. I have bought a man slave for seaven peas, whome I will send down per sloop. I have also called a pallaver about the man which panyard the slaves and told them of our abuses and losses and that your Worship would not put it up, upon which they desired time and desired me not to writ untill I heard further from them. What they will conclude upon as yett know not, but the sloop shall render advice thereof. The slave called Oldman sayes their is eight months pay due to him on pay day next insueing and that there was four months due when he come up, which I have paid him in part, but he makes a palaver for the whole, so would desire a word of advice from your Worship wether there be soe much due and wheather I may pay him or not."

An attestation I have here down and here inclosed sign'd with myne one [= own] hand, to be signed allso by Collin Hunter at Cape Coast, he being all was present, for I not expecting any such matter us'd not to call anybody but those were concerned, but for the future I will call one white man besides my warehouse keeper I now seeing it will be convenient on such occasion. Pray send me word per Mr Innes what particulars is to be given on the Companys account to the Capushers of this place at danceing times which is four dayes hence, also pray the price of the brass pans and pewter juggs, or if time permits pray send a full invoyce of all sorts goods, that for the future whatsoever sort of goods be sent me I may know the price readily, also what powder will be

I went down this morning to Captain Assum to know what answer they would return your Worship about the pallaver, the which I perceive I am like to doe noe good about, their desireing time being only to drive it of to se if you would bury it in oblivion, for they make a palaver that the man came not to rob the factory but to dig for gold as he pretended at first, that he panyard the slaves because we shot him for nothing, and they told me in short that the man was run away and when he could be found again he should be examined whether he came to rob us or noe, and that was all the answer they said they could give me, upon which I made them answer that as they had made a promis upon the first panyaring of our slaves, to deliver the ofender to me within eight dayes and have not done it, that they had taken the pallaver upon their one [= own] heads, and they ought to make good our losses, and as they had been short in their answer your Worship would be as resolute to have satisfaction, on which they made noe answer, but had the grace (though they will not give sattisfaction) to demand their dues, and tell me their danceing time is ten dayes hence and their was a dashe from the Company, so I would desire your Worship to send me word what is to be given on that account. I have not taken above three mark of gold yett this month besides charges, I haveing the ill fortune still. As the traders come down they want those goods I am out of, they being so fickell minded, that I know not what to advise for except I have a full supply of all sorts, for somtimes goods shall lie buy me two months and not be asked for and of a suddain they would be gon if I had never so many, therefore I would desire that favour of your Worship once to be at the c[h]arge of a cano with these goods hereafter mentioned except any of them be on board the sloop allready, and for the future I will give more timely advice what is wanting, for the sloop is now arriv'd and I have been in want of severall of those goods I have advised for this month. The goods I am in want of is vizt 10 chests of sheets, one hundred narrow nicconees, forty green Welch playns, and as many course sletias, and for blew perpetuanoes and broad tapseiles as many as can be spared me, twenty brass pans and pewter jugs, forty half firkins tallow, one case of Guine stuffs, also rum for I spend all [so] that I was forced to buy of the Dutch brandy to give away. Their is mentioned in your Worships letter of the 8th of Aprill last 21 boysadoes in a bale no.11, and I not questioning have charged myself with soe many in my two month account, I not haveing occasion to looking it tell Satterday last [when] opening of it for a customer I found but 18 theirin, so I humbly desire of your Worship that the mistake might be lookt over and the 3 boysadoes sent me."

Pray send per the return the narrow nicconees, green Welch playns and tallow mentioned in my last letter. Per the sloop I have sent down the man slave I last writ of, allso Collin Hunter, and have nayled up his chest presently on receipt of the letter, as your Worship order'd, but a key has he none, for he keeping the ware house opened it with the sheet chest key belonging to the factory, for he hath none but sheet chests of his own, he having sold his other some time since, which could not send down, I having never another. He also hath a few pipes earthenware in another sheet chest, which have not sent down, but have them in my possession. Edward Andrew is now come down in the sloop, being so sick and weak that he is uncapeable of any servis here. I have also sent down thre[e] old musquets, two old bandilers and the sword which the carpenter broak, they being unfit for service, so would desire your Worship to send others in their roome, for we have but one musquet and one sword in the factory.

I asked Cophe if he told him what the pallaver was and he said no, but he told me he did beleive the Idooms and Antia people were not good freinds, so if your Worship like well of it I doe think to send Cophe with a good dashe to Ticcodee to here what the pallaver is, as soon as I here he is come down, which Cophe hath promisd to give me notice of.

As for our healths we are all indifferent well except Hastings Ingram who lyes in a week condition still but I am yett in hopes of his recovery.

Also one of this town told me that they expected war with them shortly. Captain Assum did also desire me to gett more gunns, but I could not gett anything out of him concerning the war, but bid me make hast and write and told me more guns was very good and he wanted them, but Cophe told me Captain Assum had sent two slaves up the cuntrey to watch when Teccodee comes down and give him notice with all speed, and that he beleives according as the pallaver ends with him their will be peice [= peace] or warr."

As for goods I have no occasion for except there hath been a supply of sheets, broad tapseiles and blew perpetuanoes, for the which goods I could take mony enough, for otherwise I shall make but a bad month of it. Captain Brandfeilds blew perpetuanoes haveing carrid away all the mony, and now also Captain Poston being arriv'd, I doe expect to take but little, for whilst ships lyes in the road I may lock my scales in my chest, and do no damagg to the Company."
687,2,47,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,23/08/1686,Fort,RAC,"I haveing sent Captain Dales man on board his ship per the return of the cano received this inclos'd from the Captain, with a line to request me to send it to your Worship imediatly on receipt of the same, for which purpose I have now sent cano, I haveing no other business at present nor no occasion for goods except there be a suply out of Captain Brand[f]ield of blew perpetuanoes, sheets, broad tapseiles. Captain Daile now rides at Dickecove. Captain Poston is gon to Commenda. I am most intollerably trobled with rats in the warehouse. They now begin to damnifie the goods, I haveing found severall things knawed [= gnawed] per them. What further mischief they have done I am uncensible of, untill I overhall the warehouse, which I am now about to doe. If any man in the Castle can advise me how to distroy them, to advise me of the means; niether can I gett a catt any where."
688,2,48,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,07/09/1686,Fort,RAC,"These accompany's Captain Coffee by whome I have sent my months account with three marks, four ounces, three angles and four taccoes of gold, being the ballance thereof, the which I would have sent before but that Cophe said he would goe down this night, and my takeings being small and no other business presenting, I thought it not worth the sending a man down and charge of cano, knowing of this opertunity by Coffee. The slaves will make an end this week, so I would desire your Worship to send an order which are to remayne here, and also (if they be ready) to send what gunns more your worship designs for this place before the slaves goe down, that they may help gett them on the battlements. As for oyster shells I could buy none, the saltponds being so full of water which canot be lett out. Pray send word how much pay Samuell Jones must have per month and allso Mr Chambers sallery. I have had very bad trade ever since the ships arriv'd here, blew perpetuanoes carrying away all the mony that I can take noething."
689,2,49,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,21/09/1686,Fort,RAC,"These are to advise your Worship that the slaves have finished there work and only waite your Worships order for their coming down, and also desire your Worship to send me a chest or two of mundees, and if their hath been a supply out of these last ships either of blew perpetuanoes, broad tapseiles, sheets, or tallow, I humbly desire your Worship to send me a supply of them here, for the want of which goods I take but little mony they being the chiefe of the vendable goods in this place. Also powder would vend if it were in half barrells, for want of which it lyes a hand. Pray advise me whether Captain Assume ought to be paid his custom every pay day that the wight [= white] men are paid or to reckon but 12 months to the year, also how much Samuell Chambers and Samuell Jones must have per month. I know not what to doe with the rats, they damage so much good[s] that would make one mad to se, especially the woollen goods. They eat wholes [= holes] in the boysadoes, Welch plains and blankets that I can run my fist in them. I have here beneath sent your Worship account of all the damagd goods in the warehouse, the most of which is damagd per the rats, and how to remidy it I canot tell. I have presumed to use some of the scaffelling bauks to make platforms for the goods, to prevent their harboring under the sides of the old nine hand cano that was broak in fetching stones, which I had laid at the bottom of the warehouse to set the cases upon to keep the goods from the damp flower, at the removall of which we killed eight ratts of a great biggness and destroy'd two nests of six young ones apeice, but some escap'd our hands, doe what we could. What further to doe to prevent more damages I canot tell. I have spoild their harbors and made all passages free that they cannot secure themselves from a good cat, but that I have is to[o] little, soe I humbly desire your Worship to send me a bigger if it can be procurd. Here be rats almost able to deal with catts. Also would desire your Worship to send me some rum for I have none in the factory.
Goods damaged in the warehouse
6 boysadoes
12 green perpetuanoes
8 green Welch playns
12 stript carpits
10 broad nicconees
11 ditto narrow
2 narrow tapseiles

690,2,50,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,24/09/1686,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships of the 22d instant is received with the mundees and rum. Also I have received the four hand cano and have sent down the seaventeen hand cano, which now accompany's Mr Chambers, who also hath taken with him five men slaves, so that their now remayns here but six men and eight women, they being left here for the building the wall quite out to the brink of the hill, as your Worship orderd per Mr Chambers. As for your Worships order concerning the goods it shall be dilligently observ'd. As for Captain Cophe, he hath serv'd here ever since the 7th October last untill the time of his last departure for Cape Coast, but I have paid him four months sallery, that is from the first of January to the 23d of Aprill last. The reason that I paid him for those months and not for the months before was his goeing down to Cape Coast in December and coming up in January [and he] told me your Worship had paid him to January the first and ordered for the future he should be paid here, but I haveing taken but little mony at the time of his last goeing down, I would not pay him from April the 23d to that time. Pray send perticular order how many slaves shall remayn here for a constancy, which if your Worship be pleas'd to spare them four would be convenient of men slaves and one woman. Less will not be able to carry a burden from waterside to the forte and the towns people are of such a sordid nature that sometimes they will be hyrd to help us and somtimes they will not. Niether can a sentenell be conveniently kept with less and other business done, for we fetch out wood and water at a great distance from the factory, and there is one dry time in the year which we are forcd to fetch our water betwixt three and four miles of."
691,2,51,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,02/10/1686,Fort,RAC,"I have by the bearer hereof sent down my September accounts with three mark, one ounce, thirteen angles and eleven taccoes of gold, being the ballance thereof. Also I have sent one man slave which I bought for seaven peas, and desire your Worship will be pleasd to send per the return of the cano the carriage for the gunns, which lyeth unmount'd here. As for goods I have not occasion for at present, here being little trade and Dutch interlopers always passing two [= to] and from which carryes away all the mony, and the people of this place have gott such a hant [= haunt] a goeing aboard, and find the sweetness thereof so much that they will keep there mony two or three months for a ship, whereby they ruine our trade, which will scarce ever be better except a means be found to stop there progress that way, for there comes a considerable supply of mony to the place but the ships take it all. One [= on] Sunday the 26th of September the Cabashers mett under a boom of cocornutt trees behind the twone [= towne] and sent for me and the Dutchman, and going to them to know there business the[y] offered us fetishes to drink, upon which we went a little from them to consult about it and after agreement betwixt ourselves, we refused it, except they would take a ffitish to fullfill the articles concluded upon at our first settleing by both our Generalls, especially in that clause of trading aboard, upon which they answerd that they bought nothing aboard but what we could not fu[r]nish them with, and that the cuntrey people came down and went aboard and that they could not help. Unto that we replyd, as for what niether of us could supply them with they might buy freely aboard, and for what the cuntrey people bought aboard should be no palaver one [= on] them, one condition if we offerd to panyar those goods they should not assist the cuntrey people against us, but affter a long palaver and many equivocations fecht up per them they said they would go aboard for they could buy things cheaper there than of us, soe finding [them] so short we were as shorte as they, and told them playnly if the ships should take there mony if war came down the ships should secure them and that we would take there goods per force, as they had desir'd forts they should know they have fortes, upon which the pallaver was broke up tell Captain Assume was well, who being indisposed in his health was not there, so I humbly desire your Worship to advise me on what account if we should agree on a palaver I may take a fitish, for I being under command, canot take it except your Worship be pleas'd to maintain it."
692,2,52,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,18/10/1686,Fort,RAC,"These are to desire your Worship to send me on sight hereof a quantity of rangoes to the vallue of a mark and halfe or two mark of gold, for I have sold all I had to one man and have two bendyes of gold of his in my hands for more of them, which I promis'd he should have in two dayes; therefore I humbly desire your Worship to send them with all expedition, and lett them be very good, foe [= for] we had like to have parted about the whiteness of some of those I had. Also I want a supply of knives, broad stript sattens, Guine stuffs and narrow nicconees; I have lost the taken [= taking] a considerable sum of mony for want of blew perpetuanoes, broad tapseiles, sheets and tallow, which are the cheife vendable comodity here, and the Dutch are supplyd with all of them, which is a greate hindrance to my takeings. I am now to advise your Worship of a unhappy accident, that is the untimely death of John Veasey, the manner thus one Satterday the 2d instant the ffiscall and book keeper of the Mine came to overhall the Dutch ffactory and on the morrow sent for John Veasey to shave them, whome they sent home drunck. In the affternoone they came to our fforte and stayd there till night, and then they told me they had a good supper provides [sic] at the Dutch factory, and desired me to goe with them, which I did, and as we satt at supper, John Veasey came in with a tuck in his hand and one of the slaves with him, and told me it was dark, and he was come to see me home; so the Dutch would have him sitt down to supper and gave him wine and punch freely, so I fearing he would be drunk bid him begon, but they importuneing him, he would not goe untill they made him drunck, so seing him in that condition, I bid the slave carry him home and come again for me, which he did; but as the Dutch bricklayer sayeth the slave goeing to carry him down the ladder which goes up to the Dutch mans house lett him fall, where I beleive he broke his neck for in two howers affter he died not speaking one word. He hath left two gold rings, a good serge sute and severall odd things which per the next I shall give a pellicular account of, which now I could not the man hastening me to send for his rangoes. Captain Nanter past by here the 10 instant in the morning and I guess gott up as high as Dickecove that night."
693,2,53,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,20/10/1686,Fort,RAC,"Your worships of the 19th instant is received with the narrow nicconees, Guine stuffs, broad stript sattins, broad tapseiles, rangoes and rum speciffied therein. The
slaves have not yett ffinished their work so I have not sent them down, but by the end of the month they will ffinish there business, so shall send them down with my monthly accompt in the four hand cano, and whereas your Worship write I might keep four men and three women for the forts use, this is to lett your Worship understand that here is not four men your Worship would be willing to spare, for here is but six men here and Yanke and Joyce, your Worship writes for them pellicular and I cannot make four besides them without the carpenter, whom I presume your Worship did not think off, soe desire your worship would be pleas'd to send another, that can be conveniently spared in his roome, hopeing your Worship will not lessen the number, for the ill convenience that I should find thereby, amongst sordid sort of people who will not lay a hand to anything but just when there one [= own] humor serves them. An account of John Veasey's things have here inclosd, some of which I shall dispose of here, the rest I will send down at the months end with the produce of the rest. As for his pay all the white men here can wittness he owed me all his full two months pay which he did not ffully live out. As for ships to windward I here of none."
694,2,54,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,02/11/1686,Fort,RAC,"I have per the bearer hereof sent down my October accounts with 6 marks, six ounces, ten angles of gold being the ballance thereof, also one man slave which I bought for seaven peas. Likewise there accompanys the canoe all the slaves except three men, three women which are to remayn to the ffactorys servis, and one woman that is very sick so that she could not accompany the rest. I would also have sent John Veaseys chest and cloths but the cano was so full with the slaves that they could not carry it. Pray send up per return of the canoe some more rangoes, for the man that bought the last hath been here, and hath bought since my account was write most of those which are made remaining in my account and saith he will be here in a little time for tenn bendyes more of them. Also pray send some more match and cartherige paper for the forts use, and if there be ever a slave your Worship will spare in the room of the carpenter I humbly desire your Worship will be pleased to lett me have [him], your Worship ordering four men to be here whereof here remains but three. Samuell Jones told me at pay day your Worship promised to allow him something more than his ordinary sallery for looking affter cleaning the arms, which if soe I desire your worship to send me word how much he must have advanced.
[PS] Pray send a lock bolt for the back door in the wall of the fforte."
695,2,55,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,06/11/1686,Fort,RAC,"Your worships with the rangoes are received and also the table. I have now [as] your worship ordered sent down the black carpenter and allso all the slaves except three men and three women which remayne to the ffactorys servis. I would have sent them in the last cano according as I writ in my letter, but they had so much lumber to carry with them that I was afraid of the canos oversetting and so to have lost the Company mony: but now your worship ordring the carpenter to be sent down, I thought good to send the four hand cano once againe which will carry them all, for it would have cost halfe the charge to send one alone. As for Captain Nanter I cannot learne where abouts he is at present but I am informd per the man that bought the rangoes that there is never a ship betwixt this place and Axim; but as soon as I shall understand where he is I shall give your worship advice thereof. About a week since there came Yankee from his croom with all his men in arms and other Antea Cabusheers with there men in arms all to Succondee town, bringing a great complaint to Captain Assum that the Cheife of Shumah had been up Shumah river into the Idooms cuntrey and had carryd two canoes loaded with powder and shott and arms for the Idooms to come down to destroy the Antea people, upon which they went up in a pallaver to the Dutch Cheife who gave them many fine words and perswaded them it was noe such thing, so after they had been with him they came to me to know if we would assist them and to desire me to write for more gunns, to which I gave them many faire promises, which very well sattisfied them, but in two dayes affter there came one Idoom man down and told them all the pallaver was falce, he said the Cheife of Shumah was there but he came to sell those goods, and that the Idooms had panyard them and would not pay him for them, upon which they were all sattisfied and went to their crooms. Now whether it might be policy of the Dutch to sent that man down I know not, nor yett can I give credditt to the blacks, but the occasion of my writeing is to know whether if at any time such a thing should suddenly happen your worship would have me side with the upland people, or watterside people, or whether to resist either of them, for although we live among the Antea people yett the upland people are our merrchants. I also desire your worships advice about letting the Antea people in our Castle, which I understand they all depend upon, if wars should happen, which I fear would be very ill convenient without it were two or three of the old Capusheers, for the Dutch will certainly side with Idooms and these being a sordid rugged people if we should lett them all into our forte and the Dutch resist them they would overpower us and fire at the Dutch from our forte, and although I cannot credditt any such thing, yet least it should unexpectedly happen I humbly desire your worships advice in itt."
696,2,56,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,12/11/1686,Fort,RAC,"I have received your worships with the goods, which I have disposed off for the best advantage I can. I hear noe news of any ships as yett, butt as soone as I shall I will render advise thereof. And for the Duch affaires I hear nothing more att present, not haveing any convers with them this three or four dayes, the cheife being gone to Shumah, and all things are seeming quiett amoung the natives, butt here is little trade, neither hath there bene there any Idome trader downe since the pallavar happened. I will dive into there affaires as farr as possibly I can, but they are subtill and close to themselves and verry wary in there proceedings. I am alsoe to advise your worshipe that here is a new Chiefe for the Duch. The last haveing imbaseld [= embezzled] the Companys goods, was taken by the ffiscoll and carryed to the Mine about six weekes since, and the under ffactor of Axim succedes him as ffactor here, a wary man and kinsman to the Generall of the Mine, upon which he presumes on greater matters then the former did, as the stoping the Negroes going aboard, for the Ffrancis passing by here he called all the Cabusheers and told them if he see any canoe goe of to that ship he would fire into the downe [= towne] presently and putt all the Cabusheers in irons, unto which they made him little answer but only told him they would not goe aboard. This I was told by the Black which I sent with my accompts to Cabo Corsoe, for if I be there and he making pallavar against there coming aboard it is only interlopers but if I am absentte he is against Inglish Company's shipps. Pray order per next oppertunity some match, chathrige [= cartridge] paper and twine for the ffortts use for wee have none."

As for your worships order concerning the gunns upon the ffortt I will observe, but desire your worship per first oppertunity to send what more guns are designed for this place, for here is nott gunns below [sic:?= beyond] to answer a salute. Your worships letter to Mr Elwes I will send forward this night. Per this canoe I have sent John Veaseys cheste and remaynner of his things.

I being suplyed with the most vendable goods did thincke I should have had a good trade this month butt Captain Buttrams arrivall frustrated my expectation, for as soone as hee was heard of my trade ceased, the mony I have sentt being all taken the beginning of the month.

As for the three Guine stuffs your worship writes is undercharged, is not soe in my coppy. Whether I have mistook the ffigure in those sent down, I know not, but my coppy makes four hundred sixty six remayning, which I think is right. If not so [ms.

I would have sent down my accounts, but Mr Halford being desirous to depart presently according to the contents of your Worships order I had not time to make them up and write them."
704,2,64,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,12/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"By the bearer your Worship will receive my Decembers accounts with five mark, six ounces, six angles, and one taccoes of gold, which with five marks paid Mr Humfryes at Christmas is the ballance thereof, which I hope will come safe to your Worships hands, which I have been doubtfull of and that is one reason I sent them not before, fearing the canomen should take the mony from the boy, for the last time the cano went down with Mr Halford your Worship giveing the boy his letter to be gone he called the canomen to gett the cano ready and they being unwilling to goe untill the next night and the boy would not tarry, they beat him at Cabo Corso and tore his beads from off his neck and threatend to heave him overboard and at Commenda they would have beat him againe, Samuell Jones haveing much adoe to hinder them, which made the boy himselfe afraid to carry mony down with them, but the boy haveing found other canomen of his freinds whome he thought he might trust, I would have sent him by them but was hindered by the afforesaid canomen. I asked them the reason why they beat the boy, they laught at it and told me they came not to talk of that, they came for their mony, which I told them they should not have untell I made the Cabushers acquainted with it, but I had as good done nothing for tell them [= the Cabushers] what you will, they will only give a few good words and ask for a bottle of brandy. Perhaps they will sitt and chide the transgressors and he att the time shall stand and laugh in their face; but they will be sure to make a pallaver enough upon a white man if they can pick anything to build upon, for about 2 dayes before the date hereof a French ship of 12 guns and seaventy men came to an anchor at Taccarado, and yesterday the Commander and his Doctor came ashore here and while I was entertaining them Captain Assum came to the ffort, whome I sent for upstairs and set Charles Dean sentinell at the stares foot to keep the rest of the blacks down, it being their rude custome if strangers be here to run all upstares, which they would then have done, but being stopt four of them fell upon Charles Dean and beat him, which Samuell Jones seing took up a sword and struck one of them on the head with the flatt of it which drew blood of him (and that was as much as it did doe) and likewise drove the rest out of the fort, but the next day the Cabushers made a pallaver upon it and demanded twelve angles, which I was forced to give them, being unwilling to make resistance befor I gave your Worship account thereof, but if your Worship thinks fitt we might fetch it back againe, for they have as much reason to pay for stricking a white man as we for stricking a black, this being the third time they have struck a sentinell in the fort, and they are so impudent, that except we use force to keep them in aue, we shall be pulled out of the fort, and they laugh at us because we doe not, telling us our gunns stands for a show, we dare not use them. I have a cask which will hold water for a months time and more, and wood and provision I can gett in, for if a pallaver happen they canot hold long, they being but weak only dominating sort of people, the Dutch have but three men and yet he fires at all the canos that goes aboard [so] that now they dare not lett him se any goe. I have had little or no trade this month and am afraid little I shall have, the Dunkedors and Wassaws being now at warrs with the Idooms so that nothing sells but powder, which the Dutch take all the mony, for theirs being in quarter barrells, if their be any halfe barrells at Cabo Corso I could sell them here but whole they will not buy. The inclosed is a letter from Mr Bayly who now rides at Tagarado."
705,2,65,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,18/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"I have sent down this cano on purpose to give your Worship an accompt that the four hand cano is not yett returned which Thursday night last I sent down with my December account and mony and one man slave, also with a letter from Mr Bayly, who hath ride here ever since for an answer, by the black that used to bring my accounts, which I pray God to be safe come to your Worships hands, for I am much trobled I have not yet heard from him, fearing some mischance should befall him (which God forbid) but hope rather your Worship hath been the occasion of his stay, for if no casuall accident is happend question not his being at Cape Coast, but I humbly beg the favour of your Worship speedily to dispatch this cano to give me advice whether he hath been at Cape Coast and wheather your Worship hath detained him, for his delay so long doth much trouble my mind with fearfull imaginations, but trusting in God and hopeing for the best I patiently wait your Worships answer. In my letter by the boy which I hope is received I gave your Worship account of a French ship of 12 gunns and 70 men rideing at anchor at Taccarado, who now have settled a factory there and very closely carried it untell they had landed twenty one men and three great gunns which are to remayne their. The Dutch haveing notice of it sent the Fiscall to speak with the French Captain about it, who came this morning and brought four souldiers to remayne in their fort, but the French ship was gon to Commenda whether [= whither] the Fiscall imediately ffollows them. I hear they expect two more great ships down every day."
706,2,66,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,20/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"Your worships of the 17th instant is received with the twelve halfe barrells of powder and twenty narrow nicconees, which being the two only commodityes now vendable here I hope they will fetch some mony, for as yett I have but little. The nicconees according to your Worships order I shall hold at 3a per piece. I have also received your Worships letter of the 19th instant which accompany William Woodmansey, Nicholas Rutty and John Shorter, which is cheifly to caution me to be wary of my unwelcome neibours the French, the contents of which I will carefully and dilligently observe, and upon all occasions shall render timely advice of all news, arrivall of ships and whatsoever elce I can here. Concerning them the blacks tell me they work night and day in pallazadoring a peice of ground intire to itselfe and placeing three great gunns to the most advantage, and every French man hath a forked stick upon which they hang their peices loaded and bandilers full of powder, and wheresoever they remove they carry them with them and stick it by them, and I hear they are well provided with necessarys upon all ocasions. The ship has gon down to settle another factory at Ampena, which is all at present I can give account of concerning them, and for further advice concerning the blacks I can say no more than what I last wrote of, that is Charles Dean stopping them from goeing upstaires into the hall four of them threw him down and beat him, which Samuel Jones seing struck one of them and drew blood, for which we were forced to pay twelve angles. I doe not desire to make any disturbance to the Company prejudice, nither will doe anything, absolute necessity excepted, before I render your Worship advice if it be matter that requires consideration, least unadvisedly I bring damage upon myselfe, only I would have them so much in awe, that they should not dare to strike a sentrey, for putting up such abuses with goods given them I fear will incourage them to make disturbances to gett dashes, and I am glad I had a civill man sentinell, for some desperate men in that place would have gon near to have shott them, it being a common opinion amoung many that the law bears them out in such cases."
707,2,67,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,24/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships last letter commanding me to render speedy advice of all ships arrivall, I have sent this cano on purpose to give your Worship account that there is now rideing at Tagaradoe a Barbados interloper, a small sloope of three gunns and eight men, haveing but little goods the cheife whereof is Beneen cloths, rum and suggar, they have a few perpetuanoes and nicconees, but these they will vend for nothing but slaves, refuseing mony for them. I have likewise an account by the black that there is two English ships at Dickecove, but I am not certain of the truth thereof. The French haveing pallazadored a peice of ground at Taccarado and are all gon on board ship againe except three which stay to keep possession. The Dutch second of this place went thether to se their proceedings who possitively affirms the ground they have taken is almost as big compass as the Mine Castle."
708,2,68,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,28/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"In obedience to your Worships command for speedy advice of all occurrances, I have sent this cano to give your Worship account that yesterday came from the Mine to Taccarado about one hundred and fifty canoes, in each cano three men with arms, Dutch coulers flying and beating drums, to seize the French and carry them to the Mine, but they haveing notice of it the natives conveyd them up the cuntrey and fled all from the town themselves, so that when the Mine blacks landed they neither se white nor black, being nothing left but their houses which they put fire to and burnt them all to the ground, and then they marched a little way up the cuntrey fireing shott into the bushes as they went along, with intent to drive them out, thinking they were hid there, but finding nobody there they were forced to return without accomplishing their ends, but I understand by the Dutch Cheife of this place that the Generall of the Mine is resolved if possible to drive them out, for he saith if they settle there this place will be worth nothing, most of the trade comeing that way, especially now the Idooms not haveing free passage, but I here notwithstanding all their endeavours to the contrary if the French follow their business they will settle there in spight of them, for the natives are resolved to protect them and convey them away upon all occasions, and if taken at a surprize to stand by them to the last man. I here by the natives they expect two great ships more of great burthen to bring materialls for building, and then this ship that is allready here is to go for Arda to buy slaves to bring to Taccarado to work for building a fort, which is all at present but the unwellcomeness of a bad trade, for what with the disturbance of them and the difference of the upland natives it grows worse every day, for I have not taken above 13<math id=""actrade-9780197262528-math-15"" display=""inline"">

709,2,69,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,07/02/1687,Fort,RAC,"I have by the bearer hereof sent down my January account with four marks, four ounces, seaven angles and four taccoes of gold being the ballance thereof. I received your Worships letter of the 29th January mentioning what fresh goods were come over for Cabo Corso, but by reason of a bad trade have no occasion for any here. Captain Bristow said he had an order from your Worship to put six chest of sheets ashore here, but haveing so many of the last that was sent me remayning I refused them, my trade being dull. From the time of my sending for powder to the end of the month, I took but five ounces of gold, and yet not above a week before they were mad for powder and cleared the Dutch of all theres, so that my trade is such a lottery I know not what to advise for, for they are eager for a sort of goods, just as I send for them, I am not certain they will vend when they come upp. The Antea people say the war lyes betwixt Wassaws and Idooms spoils trade and the cuntrey people say it is the unjust dealings of the Antea people, so that what with one and with [ms. 'wt'] the other I have small encouragement when it is like to be better. What [= that] the upland warr hinders I know, but I am certain the Antea make it worse for there came a man and bought five peas in goods at our factory and the town panyard it from him, which is a common trade amoung them and [they] some times sell the traders two [= too] for a slave, which makes them afraid to come down. I would have gott leave of the Antea to have sent up the cuntrey with some dashes for the upland Cabushers to se if I could have made trade better or elce to have had better sattisfaction to the contrary, but they would nither consent to my goeing or sending any body and to offer it without their consent were a vaine attempt, for they would certainly doe him a mischeife. The person I have now sent down with my accompts is Hastings Ingram, who being to civilly used groweth upon my kindness and doth not behave himselfe of late as he ought to doe [ms. 'does'], he says he came of great freinds, and upon that I suppose he thinks himselfe to be to good to be under my command, his behaviour being more like a master than servant and canot show me less respect than he doth, without he should tell me playnly he is my fellow, perhaps he hath been a better man than ever I shall, yet now I think he ought to be so, so long as I am placed by your Worship as his master, so humbley desire your Worship to give him a check or elce detain him and send another man in his room which your Worship shall think fit to doe.
The French came from Taccarado to take canoes here to goe to Commenda but here [= were?] stopt by the Dutch untell an answer was had from the Mine whether to lett them go or not. Here hath passed by a Pourtugues to the Mine whose Captain was seized by the Dutch at Axim. Pray send a baile of narrow nicconees per return of the cano, a chance customer haveing bought most of that is made remayning in my accompts."

I have now by this cano sent them down signed. I have also sent the graplin and tarpaylin. The bail of nicconees is received, being the worst I have had since my being here. Thirty of them are verry much damnified, some the worm hath eaten halfe through, the doubles I can run my fist through and some the edges eaten, and those that are sound are verry course, which happend just upon the riseing of them, I fear will cause a stop to their vent. I here no news of Mr Bayly nor any other ship except a Barbarian [= Barbadian] interloper to windward which
is the same sloop Mr Wood was fitted out to take last Aprill, but hath nothing now but rum and a slave cargo. Pray send word how much William Woodmansey must have per month, your Worships last letter concerning it mentioning his full pay and he sayeth he hath left eighty pounds a year in England, allso pray send word when Charles Deans pay is to begin and whether Samuell Jones is to have anything advanced above his ordinary pay for looking after the arms."

He hath had but very bad tradeing to windward, scarce any canos comming aboard except at Bassam. He mett with Mr Bayly who is not yett gott so high as Cape Appalonia. Captain Draper humbly desires your Worship to send him word whether there be any corn to be had to leward. Here hath lately passed by three Pourtugues, one from Lisbon haveing only a slave cargo aboard, the other two had tobacco, both which were panyard at Axim, and sent to the Mine directly. This I did not advise of before thinking not worth the charge of a cano. Haveing no more but the unwellcome news of bad trading to advise your Worship of, only Daniell Coopman after I had write my letter hearing I would send a cano to Cabo Corso desired to goe down in the cano, which the Captain being willing to I consented, by whome your Worship will receive the Company pacquett."

Here is abundance of corn at the crooms, if I can perswade them to bring it down. I will call the Cabusheers together this day and here what they say, and tomorrow I shall send my monthly accounts and then I will render your Worship advice what may be done in it. I have a very bad trade here; I have not taken a bendy of gold this fortnight and better, neither hath here bin any traders down, and I cannot understand what causes it to be so bad. They have no upland wars as I can here of, only threaten it dayly, which hath bin a long time doing. The cheifest reason as I can gather is the unjust dealings of the Antea people towards them, which causes them to forsake this place, and seek trading otherways, as I am told by some of the town people themselves which used to keep correspondence with the traders."
713,2,73,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,04/03/1687,Fort,RAC,"I have sent down my February accounts inclosed herein, with mk2 6oz 1a 6ta of gold, being the ballance thereof.

My trade is very bad, I have sold nothing but sheets and narrow nicconees this month and of those a verry few, most of the latter we sold to one customer all at a time; I have not taken the vallue of a taccoe for above a week past. I have spoaken with the Cabusheers about corn, and they give me very fair promises of procureing the quantity your Worship writes for. I know there is enough at the crooms, if they will but bring it as they promise they will. They have brought about fifty chests already, most of it from Taccaradoe. There accompany this cano John Dean, carpenter, who came over passenger in Captain Draper for Cabo Corso. I desired him to come ashore to fix a door and other conveniencys for the corn room and set up cabins for the white men to lye upon, which were necessaryes I much wanted, so hope your Worship will pardon him for staying and me for detaining him so long affter the rest of the passengers.

I shall continue purchaseing untill an order to the contrary from your Worship. Here is corn enough, but they bring it but slowly in. I will use my endeavour for purchaseing a bigger quantity as soon as possible, which when I have effected, I will render advice. I have likewise put aboard the sloope the scaffolding poles and ladders, which came up heither for the building, to be put ashore at Commenda, being write for by Mr Chambers.
I have little or no trade here yett, so have not occasion for any goods. The Generall of the Mine hath write to the Dutch Cheife of this place that he will be here this week. If so he comes I shall to my power show him that civillity and respect that is due to his quallity."

Mr Pepperell still rides here, it raining so perpetually day after day that wee cannott gett the corn aboard, and having no more but an old four hand canoe which will carry but 8 chests of at a time makes it so tedious. I hired small canoes, but they wett it so much I was forced to leave them off. As soon as weather permitts I shall use all possible means to dispatch him. He hath already on board one hundred and sixty chests and I beleeve there is fourty more ashore, it shall be laden on board with all expedition. Here is more corn to be sold, but not at 2a per chest, for canoes comes from all parts both windward and leeward, from Axim to Anamaboe, hither to buy corn and give any rate for't, here comes at least 20 canoes every day, but if wee raise a price I beleeve would gett corn good quantity, for if they can have the same price of us as of blacks I should have it for the sake of my liquors, which I am forced to expend freely among them to gett what I have since I come up last."

These ten dayes of July I have not taken the value of eight angles of gold, no traders coming down by reason of the ffloods. Pray send me when conveniency permitts six chests of sheetes, twenty half ffirkins of tallow and one bale of narrow tapseeles, and six empty half barrells to put the damaged powder in, all which thought good to advise for to save the charge of a canoe on purpose, for when weather permitts traders to come down what I have of those goods would be soon disposed of. I have bought forty five chests of corn more, which is all can be gott here, for what is left is half nought and good for little.

As to promotion of trade, I have used and ever shall use my utmost endeavours to procure it. I must confesse my returns are but small, but hath never been occasioned through my negligence, for I have alwayes made it my businesse (as it is my duty so to do) to promote trade, and have given all imaginable encouragements to the natives to be conformable thereto; but if the event answer not my expectation, I know not how to remedy it. I could wish I had a trade to give you content, for it would redound as much to my creditt as to the Royall Companyes interest, and I should be much to blame if I did not seek it. You write you only expect my endeavours, which I faithfully promise to use, so pray judge me by it, and if you find I am remisse in any thing which might be to the Royall Companyes interest, deal by me accordingly, but if the successe of my pains answer not expectation, when my endeavour is used, in that point I am excusable.

A Sunday noone last a small Portuguez anchored here, and weighed att night, he said he would goe for Caboe Corso. He informes mee he saw noe shipps butt a Fleming interloper upon the Coaste."
737,2,97,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,15/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"The 11 hand canoe arrived here on Saturday at two in the afternoon, by which I received one hundred iron barrs, five whole and ten halfe firkins of tallow, all on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England. Sunday I kept the canoe, not having corne ready, but have dispatcht her this morning early with fifteen chests good corne. If you have occasion for a considerable quantity of corne, pray advise per next and shall endeavour to procure it. Here is new corne in abundance at the crooms, but must be bought with caution for they hold it up at 2a 6ta per chest, imagining wee are in need of it as formerly. I have received your letter by the two hand canoe, the contents of which shall observe with diligence. This day shall send to Axim my servant, and Captain Ashume likewise [will send] to his friends, and as they shall report whatt canoes are to be had, shall render advise; the Dutch chief here is so sociable and friendly a neighbour, that doubt not but to have his assistance. Having no news of shipping to windward have not else to add."
738,2,98,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,30/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"These are to advise you that I sent my servant to Axim to learne what canoes were there to be had, and gott a letter from the Dutch Chief here to the Copeman of Axim, of which I had an answer from him yesterday by the returne of my servant, in which he writes me he hath one very good eleaven hand canoe to dispose off himselfe, which is all the canoe[s] are there att present, but he sayes he will gett mee in a very little time a ffifteen hand or what canoe soever you please to write for. My servant tells mee the eleaven hand canoe is a very good new canoe, it was bought out of the country that day he arrived there. The length that he brought mee the measure is full forty nine foot, the breadth four foot. There is a knott in here [= her], just under the stearesmans seat above the watter, otherwise as they
informe there is noe ffault in her to be seen. The price he writes me is four bendys, and for a fifteen hand six bendys, besides sending canoe men to fetch them. This is the answer I had, which when you have considered off pray send me word whether you will have itt or noe, and whether I shall writte him to proceed for a ffifteen hand canoe, and as you please to order shall send word to Axim. Some small time since two of the white men were taken sick, by which we were disabled to keep watch as formerly. This the Negroes perceiving, made use of the opertunity one night to climb up the hill next the baie and breake open the shutter of the warehouse window, and although the iron barrs stopt them from getting in, yett they made shift by fastaning ffish hookes to stickes and alsoe to lines with a bullett of lead, to heave them into the narrow tapseiles, and by that meanes drew forth eleaven ounces in goods; this I found out by two hookes they had fastened to a great nicconee which had more weight upon it then there tooles had strength to remove, broake the hookes in itt, which I seeing made the goods be told, and found eleaven ounces wanting, the chief of which is narrow tapseiles. This lose (not knowing the transgressor) I consealed but keept strickt watch, expecting there second comeing, in which they failed me not, for nine dayes since Samuell Jones sees two men at the window, whome he watched till they had itt open, then ffetching a musquett, shott one of them through a loopehole in the fflancker with a brace of bullets, which went in att his side, and out att his backe; by this he was taken, and confessed his fellow, and this ffellow impeached six more of the towns people, upon which I sent for the Cabusheers and told them my losses, with the transgressors, and withall if they would not secure those persons that were impeached, they should pay for the goods, upon which they went presently and seized them, and finding one bendy four angles in goods in their houses, I can by no meanes perswade them to deliver the men into my possession, but they proffer to give the bendy four angles in goods again and sufficient pawns for four bendys twelve angles more, which I would not conclude upon, before I gave you advise thereof. Soe (Gentellmen) if you thincke fitt to lett the buisiness to be made up on them termes, or if you have any thing to say further in the matter, pray advise. Three dayes agoe passed by a small Portuguez to the Mina and another is att Axim, noe other ships as I heare off yett upon the Coast. Pray send me twelve peieces of boysadoes, and twenty peces of green plains, with a caske of rum. Alsoe pray order some iron shackles, I have four paire charged to me, which are sent downe with slaves, and not returned."
739,2,99,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,02/09/1687,Fort,RAC,"By the canoe I have received twenty peices of green plains, one caske containing sixty five gallons rum, and six paire of short irons on the Royall Companyes accompt. Would have sent my accompts, but being a little buissie could not gett them writen. Mr Chambers being sicke, I wanted his assistance. The goods found in the Blackes houses have received, the pawnes shall gett as soone as possible, and shall be the more urgent Captain Assume being very ill, and thinke he will dye, which if soe this will be a distracted place for a time. As to slaves here comes but few, what may be had, I will be sure to buy. Heare of noe English shipps as yett, when I doe shall not faile to advise. The Pourtuguez I wrott was at Axim, is as I am told taken by the Dutch, and sent to the Mina. Thomas Mekin and Henry Eves came with the canoe. William Woodmansey and Nicholas Rudy are the persons that were sick, the former is well againe, the latter on the mending hand. Both unwilling to leave this place, soe keep them still."
740,2,100,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,10/09/1687,Fort,RAC,"This is to acquaint you that Hukamee has been up att Axim and disliked the 11 hand canoe and has bought a 7 hand one, which he saies was your order to him to take any canoe he liked off there, for which the cheife of Axim writes to mee to pay the Cheife here two bendys for the said canoe.
I being verry bad with the fflux, not capable of writing, I could not send my accompts, but you shall have them as soon as possible I can. I have sent per Huckamee six markes of gold, which is near the ballance. The Cabusheers will give noe pawns till Captain Asshumee was well, for the breaking the warehouse, only brought part of the goods, and now Captain Asshume is dead, and there is nothing more don in the palavara, and he is buried in the Dutch Castle, and I understand that the Generall of the Mina will be here on Sunday next to putt in another."
741,2,101,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,14/09/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours by Mr Elwes is received with two anchors brandy one Turky carpett, and one sheet. Mr Elwes hath insisted on the pallavera he came for, to whom I referr you for satisfaction for what is don, myselfe by reason of sickness not being at the pallavera. The particulars of the goods stole is forty seaven tapseils narrow, and eleaven narrow nicconees. Mr Blinsham returns by the same conveyance he came. My selfe through Gods blessing being able to walke about though very faint, but hope in three or four dayes shall gather streng[t]h to go through my buisiness as well as ever, and then shall send my accompts and have all things in good posture. The canoe shall pay for as is ordered. I sent not a canoe [to inform] of the Mary's being to windward, hearing Captain Bradley had sent himself."
742,2,102,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,19/09/1687,Fort,RAC,"These serves particularly to give you accompt that have received from on board the Mary ten chests sheets and two bales blew perpetuanoes on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England. Mr Boylston hath made the pallavera for restitution of the goods stolen, and do expect immediate satisfaction."
743,2,103,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,19/09/1687,Fort,RAC,"These are to give you accompt thatt the Cabusheers came about sunn setting, and brought five ounces twelve angles in gold, seting the rest of the money upon the heads of those in hold, att six pease per man, which they would have mee take, and Cabusheir Clois sett free. After much pallavara I toke the mony, butt not as sattisfaction, telling them this that I could not end the pallavara without your order and that I would writ to you there offers, and before I received an answer from you, I could sattisfie them no further on such termes, which they desired mee to doe. Pray in your answer a word how you would have me acte in their pallavaras. These with my service to your selfe and best respects to Agent Bradley."
744,2,104,Thomas Bucknell,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,26/09/1687,Fort,RAC,"By this canoe have sent down the two men who stole the goods, also doe by this give you accompt that Henry Eves dyed yesterday in the afternoone, but hath left nothing behind him worth taking note off. A Ffriday morning last the Mina Generall came hither, and stayed till Sunday morning. He made litle or no pallavera with the Cabusheers as I can hear off, only he gave every one of them a green perpetuano for a dashee and likewise to all the Cabusheers of the croomes; he sent for the Cabushiers of Taggeradoe to come hither to him, with whom he had a great pallavera, about the ground the Brandenburgh inhabits, which he hath new bought of the Cabusheirs, and paid them four bendyes for it here, with this proviso, [that] they should turn out the Brandenburghs, which they have promised him to doe. He is now gon up to Axim. The Generall likes our fort much, but disliked his owne

746,2,106,Robert Elwes & William Cross,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,06/10/1687,Fort,RAC,"According to your order we have inventoryed the Royall Affrican Companys wharehous, and have taken an exact account of what remayns were there, one of which inclosed wee send down to you togather with his last monthly accompt we could find, and compareing that with the remayn[s] wee find him indebted to the warehouse above seaven marke of gold, without he has sent money downe to you, which by his papers wee can not find, being left in soe disperst a manner and not any book of accompts to be seen. We alsoe send you herewith an accompt of his estate, which wee have taken with all care and caution imaginable, and shall secure the same till further orders. I desire I may be ordered if you please to [stay?] in the ffactory, understanding Agent Bradley's departure will be suddenly and my September accompts not finished. Mr Cross being much ffrightened desires the same."
747,2,107,James Walker,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,10/10/1687,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys Mr William Cross, and are to informe you that this morning at four [I] arrived att the Royall Affrican Company of Englands factory. Might have been there soner, but that the canoe men would put in at Comenda, under pretence that the wind blew hard, when it was noe such thinge. Presently after my arrivall, wee went about inventorying the warehouse, which inventory have inclosed. Hope shall be more successfull than my predecessors. Shall allways have due regard and respects to your commands and instructions, and am humbly thankfull for your favor to me, and shall behave my self soe that noe dishonour shall come to you for your great kindness. Pray send me on account of the Royall Affrican Company of England, tenn barrells of powder, one caske of rum and armes for the soldiers, tenn will be sufficient, which shall be keept as ought to be. Wee have discoursed the Cabusheirs, who are well sattisfied, they have made a demand of custome, which have promised shall be allowed off as formerly, soe pray advise what itt is, as may governe my self there by. Request that I may have the sheep, and some other things which shall have need of, which did belong to Mr Bucknell, and shall pay the value on demand. Have not any thing at present that can thinke off, butt shall be diligent and carefull in the trust now reposed in me.
PS. Pray send one barrell of tarr and nailes, locks and hinges.
[PPS] Since my conclusion here is arived in the roade a Dutch sloop, and has brought from the Dutch Castle four or five men, and four great gunns. Thiere intent I know not, but leave to your judgement. I shall certainly be soe carefull that they shall have as little advantage as possible. Here is noe more than five men besides Mr Chambers and two of them are very ill, soe desire you would be pleased to send me what you thinke convenient. As to the fllag itt's soe torne that it's a shame to hoyst it, the length of it is twenty four foot, the brea[d]th sixteen, humbly desire may have a new one sent me as soon as a canoe shall come, likewise some bobins for the fflagg, match, carthridge paper, fflints for musquetts, spunges and ladles, for great gunns."
748,2,108,James Walker,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,15/10/1687,Fort,RAC,"On sight of yours, I toke Samuell Chambers alone and examined him, which way he imagined the Companys concerns should fall soe considerable short as now they did, and that he haveing the key of the warehouse in the sickness of Mr Thomas Bucknell, he must certainly know of the thing, which he says he is inocent off, and that Mr Bucknell was a man lived very high and was very liberall as to house affaires. I presently serched his chest and elce belonging to him [and] find noe more gold than five peoz which have inclosed. Have examined all men, which says nothing went out of the Castle after the decease of Mr Thomas Bucknell, and that the warehouse dore was sealed the next morning after he dyed, and continued soe till Mr Cross and Mr Elwes opened it. Shall give you due answer as to yours per the 11 hand canoe tomorrow."
749,2,109,James Walker,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,16/10/1687,Fort,RAC,"Your two bearing date the 14th instant have received by the 11 hand canoe, with fforty nine gallons of rum, six barrells of powder, six English musquetts and six swords, all new, with four paire of hooks and hinges, all on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England, on whose accompt pray send mee one hundred and ffifty iron barrs, these have here being much rust eaten, which prevent there sayle.Alsoe pray send twelve good boysadoes or more, if can spare them, these two comodityes being askt for. The Blacks here demand of me one angle upon a bendy, as being formerly allowed by Mr Whiting, and Mr Bucknell. On my deniall they made a pallavera that noe money should be brought into the Castle, soe was forced to submitt. Pray advise if must continue it. Beleive will be a hard and difficult matter to breake them of that old and soe good custom to themselves. I received three men per name as you nominated, and now shall keep a centinall day and night, and shall be soe circumspect in all actions, that the Dutchs shall find itt a hard matter to gaine any oppertunity of injuring any thing, belonging to the Royall Affrican Company of England here. The second of the Dutch came two days since to visitt me, who [I] made welcome, but could not gett any thing from him touching affairs, wee soe ill understanding one another. He told me Mr Bucknell was there debtor for powder twelve angles, which he desired might be payed.
As soon perused yours tooke Samuell Chambers by himself and demanded of him the key of his chest, which sought all over very carefully but found not there any money or papers of accompts between Mr Bucknell and him. I lookt into every place in the chamber but to noe purpose, finding nothing. I required of him what had about him, he produced five peoz and one discharge from under Mr Bucknells hand for the month August. Haveing don with him called up the soldiers one after another and examined them, who doe protest that they see not any thing carryed out of the castle after Mr Bucknell was deceased, but that the next morning Samuell Chambers sealed up the wharehouse dore and soe it remayned till Mr Elwes and Mr Cross come to inventory the Royall Companys concerns.
As to my getting out of the Blacks anything, if it were certaine there were any such thing, tis impossible, he [= Chambers] speaking Blacks soe well that he can oblidge them as he will per way of there country. I have really don my utmost in order to your comands and wish could have given you more answerable account. I have sent per this canoe two roles [= rolls] of tobacco and his chest, which is all he has in the Castlle.
I have laide wait for news of shipping to windward and am promised shall have intelligence if any comes to Axim, and that which is really true. The man have imployed is the chiefest Cabushiere in these parts, and as soone as receive shall advise presently.
Pray lett me have a bill of prizes of goods, and your answers as to the Cabushiers custom, which they thinke long till payed. Alsoe pray send me on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England, three yards of redd broad cloath. I have nothing of moment only begg pardon for the ill writing, which is because I am destitute of a penkniffe."

Yesterday morning wee arrived about seaven a clocke, and at landing was meet with a great concorse of people, which did not make any opisition, but were frindly giveing us acky: soe past up to the ffort quiettly, then sent for the Cabushers, who came. I put the question to them what injury did Mr Walker ever doe them that they should in soe inhuman a manner abuse him, which was not only the injury don to his person, for which they must make sattisfaction, butt the great affront and abuse to the English nation, which was matter of consiquence. They made noe answer butt said they would come today at 10 a clocke. Wee expected them accordingly but they came not not till just now (twelve a clocke), and putt us off till tomorrow, today being the last for mourning for Captain Ashume, all the country round about being there to lament him, and as soone as have concluded or [we] heare what they [say], and what sattisfaction or agreement they will come to, shall not faile to render advise. Noe news of shipping to windward.
PS. We have this day taken an inventory of the warehouse."

Will send you my accompts in three or four days. Mr Hassell has made an end with the Cabushires, who does say what was don was not by them, but by the younge men of the towne, who I had not paid theire custome, which now I have, they giveing sattisfaction for the [a]buse, two sheep to you, one to me, and payment for my cloaths, and a pawne which they say is a Cabushers son, that I shall not have any abuse offered or anything that is ill. Reffer you to Mr Hassell, whoe will informe you more at large. Pray send me on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England, thirty or fourty halfe ffirkins of tallow, or what you can spare, with the goods advised you of in myne of the 16th instant, alsoe stores for the Castles use.

Yesterday I received the possession thereof according to your order of primo ditto, by the hand of Mr Johnson.
In which concerne I hope to discharge my self of all things committed to my care, and to give you good sattisfaction of my dilligence, therein, and for your favor I humbly thanke
At my arrivall on the first instant between 5 and 6 in the morning, I found Mr Walker laid forth, who dyed the evening before, about 5 in the affternoon. I demanded his keys, and all things belonging to the deceased. They who watched him tould mee the wharehouse and his chest was sealed up per his order, and all things was there inclosed. His corps was enterred about one in the affternoon, neare to his predecessor, I haveing the company of the Copeman and second of the Dutch Castle at his funerall, I beseeching God to give me good success, to enjoye and survive my predecessor.
By the inventory you will plainely see what goods and materialls are wanting in this ffortt, seeing the remayns are soe much damnified. Bee pleased to send on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company 5 or 6 chests of sheets, 100 or 200 iron barrs, 3 or 4 boysadoes, a caske of the best sortt of knives, allsoe accompt of the prizes of all goods as now sold, and if can be spared a carpenter, with some plank, nailes and small trucks for the gunns, as alsoe to make up 2 or 3 cabins for soldiers.

Also I desire certaine goods from Cabo Corso, which if not sent before this comes, to your hands, I pray add, thirty narrow tapseeles, and half ffirkins tallow, what you thinke fitt. I do expect little trade this month, seeing the Adooms are fallen out amongst themselves. As I have accompt, shall give accompt of their proceedings. I hope I may live quietly with those people here. As yet I have nothing to say against them, but they ask me often, if I am to revenge the quarrell of Mr Walker, which I tell them I have not any thing to do in. The Cabushiers have demanded their dashees, I desired them to tarry untill I have heard from Cabo Corso. As for any thing else I referr to my former.
Just at the sealing of the letter, there is a shipp appears just off of Tackerada. What she is know not.
PS. One of the clock afternoone"
754,2,114,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,11/11/1687,Fort,RAC,"This day about 12 a clock came into this roade Captain Emanuell Burgess, who intended for Cabo Corso, who brings a note from the Mary, the contents are as as followeth, vizt
Thomas James, 10 November 1687
If you be an Englishman, that these lines shall come to, I am now the King of Englands shipp, and have this day been engaged with a pyrate and his prize, both of them having about 36 gunns, and for want of a wind and currant setting into the bay, I am now to leward of them, therefore if you be an Englishman desire your assistance, and tomorrow will certainly take them both, and in so doing, you will oblidge your King, and the Royall Affrican Company and your servant, now comander of the Mary.
Wee have been engaged this day about 8 houres. I understand but one Englishman hurt. This day about 12 I heard many guns, as it seemed to be broad sides, although no place mentioned in the letter, what bay [he] speakes off, but I understand by blacks, they are near to the Brandenburgh Fort."
755,2,115,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,15/11/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 12th ditto I have received, as also a letter to Captain James, which I have sent, he being then at Comenda. According to your order, have acquainted the Cabushiers concerning their dashees, and of their barbarous usage to Mr Walker, to which they give litle answer, only hums and haws, of which I cannot understand, but [they] tell me they love me very well, and desire I may tarry with them and they will do very well by me. I have made what inquiry I can, as concerning the Idooms warr, which is as I am informed, there being four or five coming to towne this day and give accompt that it is quite over, it being only two great Cabusheirs, the one taking away the others wife, and concerd her, some pallavera having been, for 4 or 5 days past, and further tells me that severall Idooms will be downe very suddenly. As for any shipps, to windward, I hear of none, only the pyrate lyeth still at the Brandenburgh fort. It seems the Dutch Copeman had the pyrate ashore at Axim and treated him well, for which he is dismist, and the Copeman of this place is this night going thither Chief. By this canoe comes two white man, Joseph Boyce and John Cunnington, the one being sick, and the other understanding the Coast friggatt is suddenly to be paid off, and he having debts owing him, and he owing to me, desire to be there at the time of payment and then to returne, as also Boyes [= Boyce] when well.
I begg your ffavors in sending the prizes of the Royall Company merchandizes as now sold, being unwilling to damnifie the Company or hurt my selfe, which at present am i[g]norant off the goods remayning.
[PS] If men can be spared pray send a man or two."
756,2,116,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,16/11/1687,Fort,RAC,"This afternoone about 5 of the clock came to an anchor in the roade of Tackerada, the pyrate and his prize, and sent his boat, intending to go ashore, but the Blacks sent off to the boate a two hand canoe, to tell them they should not come there from the pyrate. They [= the pirates] said they would come and bring great guns, and destroy them, if they would not yield tonight or tomorrow,
My endevors shall not be wanting in securing the Royall Company ffort, having water for 20 days, and the Cabushiers will hinder their coming ashore here, as they have promised. The Blacks this day tell me there is a great shipp at Dickiscove, being darke could not see his colours. Also say the pyrate had seaven men killd by the Mary, and were buried in the Brandenburgh ffort, for which he saith he will have satisfaction. How many wounded know not. What is further needfull, be pleased to advise."
757,2,117,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,19/11/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours per Mr Price I have received, and have per this canoe sent two carbines, one pair of pistolls, one birding peece, one silver hilted sword, and a Black boy, being Mr Walkers. Hoping to be at Cabo Corso on Munday next. The pyrate and prize went to leward yesterday, supposing to Comenda, as the Blacks say, to setle a factory there."
758,2,118,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,18/12/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 12th ditto I have received and the merchandizes therein exprest out of the Ann sloope, Mr Richard Bradshaw Master, and are as ffolloweth, six chests of sheets containing three hundred and ninety, one hundred and fifty iron barrs, fifty tapseiles, fifty halfe firkins with tallow, and fifty one gallons rum, all on account of the Royall African Company of England. According to your order, have put on board the same sloope all the damnified powder that was remaining in the fort, being in all eight and a halfe barrells of damnified powder. I shall doe all I can to make the best and quickest returne of the merchandizes. I heare since I came up of some canoes that are to be sold at windward, five, seven, nine and eleaven hands, which with your order shall endeavor to buy, rangoes being there good, the deepest redd are the best. The charges from hence is four angles for a two hand canoe and kanky mony for the time of their stay. The Black that goes belongs [to] the Fort, and hath been there in the time of Mr Thomas Bucknell."
759,2,119,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,20/12/1687,Fort,RAC,"My last was on the 18th ditto, since none from you. This day the Cabushiers of this towne was with me for there dashes for a new Cheife, in which pallaver I ffollowed your order of the 12th November, to which they would not give me answere, but said they would stop the traders from coming to the Castle to trade if I did not pay the dashes. I feare the next thing will be in hindring the Royall Companys slaves in fetching of wood and water or shutting up the gates. At my arrivall here I found Mr Thomas Price and two more very ill disposed in body, with greate paines in the head, and burning feavors and womitings. Desire those things may sent that are necessary for those distempers, as I have writt the doctor. I desire one caske of beefe and a caske of bread, these two that are here are neer out, and shall send the produce with the ballance of my monthly account, and for wood and water shall gett into the Fort what I can. If you will be pleased to allow the dashe they will be satisfied, if not be pleased to send some Cabushier to discourse them, for I have noe one here that I can trust."
760,2,120,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,30/12/1687,Fort,RAC,"My last was the 20th ditto, since none from you, in which I gave you account of the Blacks palaver about their dashee for a new cheife, and also that without they would stopp the trade of this place, which next day they did, and have had noe trade since. I doe beleive and alsoe are informed, if they can gett me they will send me to Cabo Corsoe Castle."
761,2,121,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,03/01/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the primo instant have received and, have sent for the Cabushiers, some of which are a rowsawing, and will be in towne tomorrow, being sent for, and those that are here will not doe anything untill they come altogather. Shall doe all I can to end the palaver. The indisposition of Mr Price hath hindred me of sending my monthly accounts with ballance and inventory of the warehouse, hopeing that in a day or two he will waite on you, and give you a just account how all things are here. I heare this morning that Captain Batherne is at Axim."
762,2,122,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,04/01/1688,Fort,RAC,"This accompanyes Mr Thomas Price, who according to your order brings you my monthly accounts with the ballance, which is one marke, two angles and nine taccoes of good gold, as also the true inventory of all the Royall Companyes goods remaining in their Forte of Succondee.
This afternoone I gott together the Cabushiers, but they would not come into the Fort. I told them it was to pay them their customes as you had ordered for a new cheife. I could not perswade them, but what I had to say I must speake to a Black and the black to tell them, which I did, that you were willing to give them for a dashee of a new cheife, one green perpetuano and one anchor of brandy, seing they had custome for a new cheife, I could not perswade them soe lately, they might very well take it, and that I was ready to give it them. The Cabushiers sent me word they had been soe often for their customes that I had made them ashamed, and that they would have me goe to Cabo Corsoe and not to stay here, which is all I can gett at present from them.
If you are pleased to allow the blacks to chuse the Royall Companys servants, and to send them of at their pleasure, they will have one every two or three months, which will be very hard for any to live without better reasons or objections then they, as the blacks tells me. If you will be pleased to send a Cabushier to discourse them, that the truth may be knowne wherein I have [not?] done any thing, but always endeavored to oblige all the Cabushiers of this towne, as much as possible I could, and have endeavored to encourage trade with them as much as any man, and they never come to the factory, and goe away but they have drams. Having not any one that I can trust to tell them anything, wherein I can be sure they tell the same I speake to them, doe beleive they tell me one thing and the Cabushiers another, which you will be pleased to send a Cabushier, and their customes, and that their may be a right understanding between us, I beleive all things will doe well and the Cabushiers satisfied a greate deale better then now they seeme to be, by reason of a bad interpreter between us. Hopeing this thing will be taken into your consideration, being the reall truth."
763,2,123,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,13/01/1688,Fort,RAC,"This accompanyes Captain Quow, who I hope will give you a just account of the pallaver with the Cabushiers and traders of this place, though it was ended the evening before, by Captain Batherne and my selfe, which hope is to your likeing to pay the blew perpetuanoe, two narrow niccanees, one ankor of brandy and one anchor of rum, for their customes of a new Cheife, and have free trade, and all things elce to be the same as formerly before this palaver begun, on the payment of the aforesaid goods, which next day was done. I would have given you accompt before this but Captain Quow hindred me by his arrivall next morning with your orders, and being desirous to give you the greatest satisfaction I can desire that Captain Quow might here the pallaver and the agreement between the Cabushiers and me, which was made the night before, which was granted, and find nothing in itt but there dashees being not paid as formerly had been done, that now they are all goods [sic] ffriends, and will doe all they can to encourage trade to this Fort, and the Cabushiers frowes you all ackey. The green perpetuanoes being all damaged, paid Captain Batherne 9a for one blew perpetuanoe, which shall charge in my monthly account, and also the two ankors of brandy per Captain Quow, which are already expended, one to the Cabushiers and the other in the time of the pallaver. Shall endeavor to redeeme the time that has been lost and encourage traders, hopeing my two accompts for November and December are right. Desire the receipts for the ballance, and also a noate of those mens wages that came to me last. A day or two past the Dutch slaves and the French had some skirmishes att Taccaradoe, wherein some was wounded. How many kill'd know not, but in the night aboard the French ships was fired 6 or 8 guns, supposeing some officer was buried, and at Quidah the Dutch and Brandenburg has 2 or 3 skirmishes, but of what effect know not."
764,2,124,Thomas Price,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,17/01/1688,Fort,RAC,"I arrived here about seaven this morning, where I found all at quietness. I understand the pallaver was made up before Captain Quow came up, with the help of Captain Batherne, who will be able to give you a true and exact account of all their proceedings. Since the business has been made up, Mr Blinsham hath taken but eight angles for iron barrs, they carry their mony aboard shipp. Captain Batherne is now at ankor between Shumah and Succonde, and endeavors to turne it up higher and higher."
765,2,125,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,17/01/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 16th instant per Mr Thomas Price I have received, and find that you will not allow of the dashees paid to the Cabushiers and traders, which was one blew perpetuanoe, one anchor of brandy to the Cabushiers, two narrow tapseiles, one anchor of rum to the traders for their customes, and to end all pallavers, and make a free trade to this Fort, and one anchor of brandy expended in the pallavers. Doe beleive had their dashees been paid at ffirst without any trouble as Mr Walkers was, [they] would have taken as they did of him, one green perpetuanoe and one anchor of brandy to the Cabushiers, one broad tapseile and severall case[s] bottles of rum, but how it was charged to the Royall Company know not. I hope may be allowed the same as my predecessor was, if not the same that is paid, I desire you to allow what you thinke fitt. I hope Captain Batherne when comes to Cabo Corsoe will give you a good reason for the payment of those goods, who seing the narrow watching of the Blacks for me, and doe beleive if could have gotten me as they did Walker, they would have served me the same, and also to other things, as the Blacks pretended to in the hindrance of rowsauing, their were
damnified. Hopeing all things will be considered, and not thinke too much paid on the agreement with those unruly people."
766,2,126,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,20/01/1688,Fort,RAC,"Having an oppertunity by a two hand canoe bound to leeward, would desire you to send up some powder and lead barrs for the use of the Royall African Company of England, the said goods be likely to be in request at this place, by reason of the warrs breaking out between the Adoomes and the Warshaws. Captain Batherne came to an anchor in this roade yesterday, he hath noe greate matter of trade, but presents his most humble service to you. Referring you to my former, hopeing you will consider me as other men."
767,2,127,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,01/01/1688,Fort,RAC,"My last to you was the 20th ditto per a leeward canoe, desiring powder and lead barrs, to which be pleased to ad some sheets on accompt of the Royall African Company of England, having disposed of most of those sheets that were remaining here by reason Captain Batherne had none left, but takes what mony comes for other goods. Hopeing in a little time may have a trade at this place, if warrs continue."
768,2,128,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,25/01/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 23d ditto per the eleven hand [canoe] have received and also 100 lead barrs, three hundred and ninety sheets, ten whole barrells of powder, all on account of the Royall African Company of England, and shall be sure to returne you the Companys gold where the goods are disposed. As to the customes which I have paid to the Cabushiers, is very little more than what Mr James Walker gave before me. Whether its on the Companys account or his owne I am not certaine. Here are them that delivered it, and see the goods paid. I desire to know what you will allow, and for the rest I will doe as well as I can, and the Royall Companys honor and intrest shall be wholy seekt for by [TB]"
769,2,129,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,03/02/1688,Fort,RAC,"This accompanies my monthly accounts with the ballance, being six ounces, six angles and foure taccooes, which you will receive per bearer. I have not charged any of the Cabushiers dashes to this months account, having not your orders. Trade I have had none this 8 or 10 dayes, noe people from the upland country. Expect to heare of the Adoomes and Wasshawes second fight very suddenly. Captain Batherne sayled out of this road the 31st of January 1687/8."
770,2,130,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,20/01/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the ditto I have received, in which you blame me for not giving you advice of Mr Thomas Prices going from hence per my last, which I could not do, he being then on board Captain Batherne, and came here in a day or two after, and then told me Mr Robert Elwes had received a letter from you, for him to go to Comenda. I have always endeavoured to oblidge the blacks of this place, and do beleive that should any aske them of my kindness to them, they would speak well of me, or elce I am sure they abuse me much. I am sorry the ballance of my monthly accounts are not greater, I wish it were in me to enlarge them, but at this time it lyes in many, that in litle time I hope will amount to the largeness of your desire. It is now very small, yet larger than my neighbour, for three months last past for goods sold 5mk 4oz 0a 0ta and all charges to be deducted. I am informed of two or three English shipps at windward, one at Dickiscove as I understand by blacks a pink. I cannot hear but by blacks and oftentimes they tell lyes to gett a dram. I wish I could be more punctual in my writing of things at windward. Some time you may heare of shipps at windward before me, by some vessell as goes to the Mina, which passeth here at great distance. Captain Buttram came into the roade of Tackeradoe on the 9th instant, and two or three days after came to an ankor off of Abody. Five or six shipps have past here to the Mina this month from Holland, whereof three for slaves. It shall be always my care and indeavours to maintain the Royall Company honour and interest, to the utmost of my power."
771,2,131,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,03/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"My last to you was the 20th February, since none from you. This accompanyes my February accompts, which ballance comes per bearer, being in all one marke, one ounce, one angle, tenn taccoes and a damboy, which finding write [= right] pray send a receipt for this and January accompt, haveing as yet none. I should have sent this month accompts two or three days sooner, being ill disposed desire your pardon. I have endeavored as much as possible I can to enlarge but as yett cannot, the [A]doomes and Warshaws being now for two or three days past fighting, as I am informed. Some Cabushiers desire the Adoomes to come in to this towne to
reside here till the warrs are over. Its expected the Adoomes will be beaten. What goods will be wanting here I know not, there being so small a trade at present, only nicconees being in request. I understand Captain Buttram intends a trade at Cabo Corso Castle on Munday next."
772,2,132,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,12/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"This morning arrived here Captain Lomax boat with the Royall Companyes letters, and desires they may be sent forward to Cabo Corso Castle. He being a stranger himself to this Coast, cannot spare his boat and men. The ship is now at Dickiscove at present, finding but litle trade, intends to be here in two or three days, Captain Barrett arrived here on Friday. Wee have a generall conformation [= confirmation] by all Blacks here, of the totall route of the Adoomes by the Warshaws, who having taken all the countrey but two little small towns, which are said to be taken yesterday. This morning a messenger is sent by the Warshaws to the Cabushiers of this towne to have a pallavera with them. Hoping in few days to have encouragement of a better trade than for some time hath been."
773,2,133,William Ronan,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,12/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"On my arrivall here I have according to your orders, and directions, proceeded in inventorying this factory, and made an end next day following. No mony to be had this voyage, Mr Blinsham being in advance for the Company, the accompt of which have by me. The rest of his accompts are not as yet made up. Mr Price parted for Axim a Saturday night. Here is some prospect of a trade, the warrs being over. If John Downs sends the accompt of the bread, and beefe supplyed Mr Blinsham, I will returne the produce. This accompanyes the packett, came by Captain Lomax, who complains very much of meeting no trade to windward. He has some letters for Captain Buttram, but judging his departure, did not send them. Mr Price on his returne will bring them. Captain Barrott is just now departed, he could procure no corne here. Excuse scarcity of paper."
774,2,134,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,16/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"This night about 6 a clocke I received the inclosed seaven letters from on board Captain Lomax, who as yet is at Dickescove. I heare of noe more shipps to windward. Per your next be pleased to advise, if I shall take the charges of canoe hyre of Captain Lomax, or place to the Companyes accompt. I hope by this, Mr Ronan and Mr Price have given you an accompt of all things here, since which is litle don, only this day came to this fort Yankey and Ashreney, with 4 or 5 Warshaw people, to make a pallavera with the Cabushiers of this towne, and as I am informed they meet at Yankey's croom on Sunday next. At the time of their stay, I made them welcome and showed the Warshaws severall goods, and told them they should be kindly dealt with, for what they wanted. At present here is no corne to be had, it being at the croomes, and there slaves are going, and some gon to panyar the Adoomes, I have per this canoe sent you one man slave, on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England, desire there may be short irons sent per the returne of this canoe. The Generall of the Mina has sent to the Copeman here, to give a bendy a head for men slaves, and seaven peaz for women, in any sorts of goods. I can say nothing to goods as yet, having not taken one cracra since the inventorying of the warehouse. As things shall offer shall give you an accompt."
775,2,135,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,21/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 19th ditto [received], with a letter to the Copeman of Axim, which is sent forwards. On Sunday last arrived here Captain Lomax in his boat, who being dissatisfied with the blacks at Dickiscove about the delivery of corn bought, and also to understand how trade went here, wherein I could give no encouragement, and desires me to let the linguister, that belongs to this place, go to Dickiscove, with him, to have a better understanding between them, who went from hence last night, about twelve a clock. I understand that the Adoomes got togather in a small party, and did much damage to some of the Warshaw people, the Addoomes being disperst in the woods. The Warshaws have invited this townes people to take of them what they can, [so] that wee have now very few people in the towne and at present here is no trade for slaves or money. As yet I cannot add to the moneys that was taken when Mr Ronan and Mr Price were here, only one man slave, which you shall receive with my March accompts and what elce shall purchase to the end of this month. In your next be pleased to order, if shall draw this months accompt from the primo March, or from the 10th ditto. I shall do what I can to get in corne, but at present there is knowne [= none] to he had. I shall do what I can to satisfie the ballance of my former accompts, and shall obey your order in sending it with the accompt, but what I had, and what I have taken, was [paid] to the soldiers, being now out of pockett about 5oz of gold, for the Royall Company, and at present have hardly any to buy provitions. According to your order I asked Captain Lomax for the charges of canoe hyre, that is two canoes to Cabo Corsoe and one to Dickiscove, being in all 8a on his accompt, which money he refused to pay, only the first canoe to Cabo Corso Castle, and tells me he will discourse it with you. By this canoe you will receive one Samuell James, a soldier, for some time residing in this place and for some time since my coming here has been very refractory in this ffortt, by his behaviour and language, and yesterday being the 20th ditto abused me very much with a great many curses and oaths, and also threatned mine and others lives that were then in the Fort. To execute his intent got a large cutlas in the night at sentinell with him, on the topp of the house, and said, who ever came there, he would cutt him in peeces or shoot him, at which time, being not his watch, I understanding this, demanded his armes, which he refused, but by force of soldiers disarmed him and for myne and others security, put him in irons, he being still desperate, and fearing he would do mischief to some of the soldiers that lay in the room where he was, I put him into the slaves prizon, and also [he] said he would bring blacks, and beate us all out of the Castle, also said that I had put him in irons as a slave but could not sell him, but bid me have a care he did not sell me, and all the rest, he having severall times before had great conferences with blacks, and in the midle of the night in another mans watch, sets open the doores of the Fort, with a great many other bad circumstances, which I have here omitted, thinking it will be tedious to repeate, beleiving this may be sufficient."
776,2,136,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,22/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"My last was the 21th ditto, since none from you. The last night arrived the Black I sent to Dickiscove with Captain Lomax, who tells me there is corne enough to corne 2 or 3 shipps more, but Captain Lomax being a near and fretfull man, and not giving blacks drams, and not oblidging, [they] began to fall back from their words and [he] sending the King a dashe and none to the Cabushiers, but now tis all well, and he may have his corne if he pleases. The last night also came into this towne severall Warshaw people, some wounded by the Adoomes and came here for shelter, and tis said by some blacks that the Adoomes have gotten what before had lost. Those that came here of Warshaw people have made [omission] to the Cabushiers of this towne, but what is don in the pallavera is not knowne, being by them kept very private."
777,2,137,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,26/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"My last was the 22th ditto, since none from you, The last night I received the inclosed from Axim. On the 23th ditto arrived Captain Bridges, who lyes in the roade of Abodey. As to what I said in my last concerning the Adoomes gaining the parts of their countrey they had lost, it is true. I understand that a great many people are going out of this countrey to help the Warshaws. The Generall of the Mina hath sent to their Fort here two great guns, six foot long, and carryes a large 4 lb ball, and also per next do expect from the Mina 8 or ten men more. I understand that Abond Cabushier of the Mina doth threaten these people in much about the 11 bendyes they owe him, what he will do, if they carry their money and slaves any where but to the Dutch, so at present they carry what they have for feare of him."
778,2,138,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,02/04/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 30th past by Mr Jefferyes have received and shall follow your orders. This accompanys my March accompts with one good man slave, also one ditto sent the 16 March, for which be pleased to order a receipt. What moneys have taken this month, as per accompt appears, will not defray the soldiers and Forts charges this month by 5oz 3a 2ta, here being no trade at present for either moneys or slaves. On Friday last Captain Lomax went to leward. Captain Bridges remaynes here, I doubt with litle or any trade. Here is litle talk of the warrs, expecting to hear in 10 or 15 days. Captain John Lomax hath not payed me the canoe hyre, as I have payed for him, which be pleased to stopp and is as under. Also be pleased to send per bearer some large paper for accompts and some small for letters, having none left of either sort.

the bay of this place, hath been very bad seas, insoemuch that they had much adoe to ride it out, the like of seas hath not been knowne here this great many years, but now all quiett. Since the carpenters have been here, have don litle, by reason of the bad weather, have employed them in doing some small jobbs in the Fort, and desire there may be 5 iron barrs made 2 foot and 5 inches long, one end to go into the wood, the other to nayle, the rest of the windows in the Fort being all iron barrs but this is not, as I formerly gave you accompt. Also here being two of those gunns that are here quite dismounted, by which are unserviceable, the carriages being rotten, understanding there is two carriages aboard the Alligator sloop that will fitt those gunns, which if you please to order, shall put the two gunns in those carriages.

780,2,140,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,19/04/1688,Fort,RAC,"This accompanies Mr James Bayly in the Adventure sloop, in which I have putt on board, on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England, three good men slaves, which I hope will come safe and well to Cabo Corso Castle. I have don what I can, with those people I have of the Companyes, for the speedy dispatch of the two sloopes, but the weather has much hindred. Trade here is none, for any sorts of goods. Have not moneys to defray charges this month, and pay day is neare at hand, desire three angles and two taccoes of gold, which moneys I payed the last month, to defray the charges of the Royall Companyes Fort. The people of this countrey are going to fight the Adoomes, since are already gon. I heare not of any shipps belonging to the Royall Company at windward."
781,2,141,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,20/04/1688,Fort,RAC,"I have per Mr Leonard Jefferyes sent you one good man slave on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England, [and have received from him] one carriage for one of the gunns of this Fort, for which I have given him a receipt, also the four pair of short irons, as formerly you writt. The Dutch panyarrs all the Comenda men as comes here to this place. What elce referr to my last per Mr Bayly. As to moneys can gett none, shall do all I can to make it up in good slaves, or what elce offers. Pray per the next oppertunity, be pleased to send some small and and large paper, for accompts."
782,2,142,Theophilus Blinsham,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,27/04/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 25th ditto per Mr Ronan have received, and shall with all civility treat him to content, and give you thanks, also one Serjant and two soldiers, who with the rest shall be carefully looked after. I have per this 9 hand canoe sent three musquetts, which are out of order and unserviceable, desire they may be changed, also be pleased to add one musquett more to those sent, that each man may have armes, and if can be spared, five collars of bandileers, and some odd ones, to fill these collars here. In my last of the 19th per Mr Bayly I sent three good men slaves, which I heare not off, though I hope you have well received them. I doubt this factory will not defray charges this month, seing have taken no more than 1oz of gold, and pay day being on Friday next, shall be more out. I should not have been so earnest, but am to borrow moneys to buy provitions, which is here scarce. I have ever endeavoured to my utmost to gaine a good trade here, and would gladly imbrace it, but hitherto am put by of my desire. On the 25th ditto the under Fiscall was here at the Dutch Fort, and said the Generall intended to take the Adoomes part, if the Warshaws and this countrey did not suddenly make an end of the warr, and send Abonnidoo with his army to fight the Warshaws. Since the fight at Great Comenda, these countrey people stand much in feare of the Dutch."
783,2,143,William Ronan,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,27/04/1688,Fort,RAC,"I have not as yet any subject deserving your perusall, only to advise you of my arrivall here, and for the promise of kindness you were pleased to give me, I do returne you infinite thanks, assuring you that my utmost care and indeavour shall no way be wanting in the Companyes buisness, and shall be ever freely disposed to oblidge you on all occasions. As for occurrences for the present, do referr you to Mr Blinsham."
784,2,144,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,24/01/1686,Fort,RAC,"Here passed by an English ship this morning taken by two Ffrench men to windward. Shee had on board the men belonging to a Dutch Companys ship which they have likewise taken and secured, sending the men in the afforesaid ship for the Mine. What they have done with the English men belonging to her, I cant learne; this news only I have it from the Dutch man here who went on board to know what ship it was, and found as I have given your [Worship] an account. He tells me farther, that as soon as the two French ships now [at] Succondee come down they have a design upon Captain Woodfine, and that the other ship here is fallen to leward on purpose to secure him from goeing away. She is a ship of force and full of men, and what goods he has on board are only such as he has taken from the Brandyburge, Dutch and English, haveing little or nothing of French on board. John Cabess advised me to write to Captain Woodfines mate to weigh in the night and goe for Cabo Corso, for he has been on board, and sayes they are pyrates; but I advised him [= Woodfine] of the same in the morning, and as I understand by them I sent, he laughed at it, I wish he may [have] noe cause in the end. The Dutch man tells me he beleives the Generall of the Mine will write to your Worship aboute it, but for fear he should not, I have sent this canoe. If it stands with your convenience, pray send me some more broad nicconees by the canoe; those you sent last are sold to four. I thought it altogether necessary to advise your Worship of this."
785,2,145,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,05/02/1686,Fort,RAC,"I gott safe up with the goods, I thank God, and found all things in good order; but looking over the ware house and goods there I found among the caske of knives, a bill which gives an account of noe more then 145 dozen, whereas they are charged to me for 205 dozen; here is a mistake of 60 dozen of knives which, if it had not been so reasonably discovered, it might a breed a[s] great distraction as the sletias, and put your Worship to a great deale of trouble and me charge, for I suppose I must have paid for them. Herein comes a coppy of the bill; I humbly desire your Worship will be pleased to order Mr Hassell to sett this to rights in my last accounts, for I have charged 205 dozen according to invoyce I received. I am sorry it soe falls out, to give your Worship this trouble, but I hope you will excuse me in it, for it can noe way in reason be imputed to me. There is a Portugale ship at Shuma and the blacks say a Ffrench ship or two to windward. I have sent Mr Humfryes the mony for the bafts."
786,2,146,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,10/02/1686,Fort,RAC,"These with my humble servis to your Worship are to desire you to send me another caske of horne halfted knives, haveing disposed of that I had here, and because there was a mistake of sixty dozen, as I gave your Worship an accompt in my last, discovered first by a note found among them, which now appears likewise by tale. I have sent William Bedford for your further sattisfaction, if you please to inquire into the matter; for the mistake must be when sent from the Castle, it cant be since they came here. I hope I dont displease your Worship while I give you this troble, but knowing you to be as good a[s] great, humbly presume you will excuse me, and order these thing to be sett to rights. The Ffrench sloop rides here, and another at Butterue.
PS. I cant hire a canoe here to Cabo Corso under 2a and 2 taccoes canky mony."
787,2,147,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,13/02/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yours with a caske of knives containing 108 dozen of knives I have received, and had sent a bigger canoe could I have got one, there being none but two hand canoes belonging to the town, since John Cabess at Christmass last left his at Cabo Corso, it proveing soe leakey he could not come up in it. The number of the first caske of knives is soe obscure I cant certainly tell what to make of it, but suppose it to be as per margent [= margin] ['no.540' in margin]. I have sent the head by the bearer for your Worships sattisfaction. Here is a parcell of old sheets, damnified, which will not goe off at the price with the other, but if you please to give me order I shall dispose of them the best I can; I have occasion for some liquor for the use of the ffactory, which your Worship may send per Captain Nuna, who comes as he tells me to look after one of his boyes that is run away."
788,2,148,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,03/03/1686,Fort,RAC,"These comes with my humble servis to your Worship by Captain Nuna, who brings my account and mony. I have occasion for some more sheets and horn halfted knives, and brandy for the use of the ffactory. The knives I beleive I must be forced to sett at 12 per angle, yet I have kept them up still at 10, finding them to goe pretty well till within six or eight dayes, but there are some soe eaten up with rust, they will heardly sell at all. Captain Nuna has [been] severall times at me for his wages, but knowing not how long he has been here or upon what account I have refered him to your Worship for an order, if you design he must be paid here."
789,2,149,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,10/03/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yours by Captain Nuna with twenty four gallons of rum and two chests containing one hundred and thirty sheets I have received and desire your Worship to send some carpits with the rest of the goods, if you can afford them at 3a per peice, for there is a man at that rate would have layd out a bendy and a half. Here lys a French ship, takes all the trade from the shoare so that we have littill to doe at present."
790,2,150,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,17/03/1686,Fort,RAC,"These lines humbly comes to acquaint your Worship that on Fryday last the Captain of the French ship and his Liutenant went to give the king a visit at Great Comendo, takeing John Cabess with them, but since understand their business was more, for they have a design to settle either here or at Ampena and build a ffortification and went in order to gett the kings leave, which tis said by great presents they have obteyn'd, and he given them a pawn on board. I cant learn the whole, things are carri'd so private. They have been extream kind to John Cabess, presenting him high, and he a little to[o] fforward in serving them if he considers the obligation have been lay'd upon him by the English. They have severall times sent him on shoare greate quantity of goods, more I am sure than has monyes to pay for, which makes me beleive he is to keep a ffactory for him [= them] at his house till they returne, for they are gon to windward and design to trade about a month before they come down againe. They have left ashore at John Cabesses some water caske with [ms, 'wt'] one of their men to look affter them, the man is an Englishman, born in Cornhill. These are a new Company newly raised in France, the former and this being the two firste ships have been ffitted upon their account. I received the knives and carpitts by the An Sloop and desire your Worship to send some more sheets the next time she comes, or otherwise if with conveniency."
791,2,151,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,18/03/1686,Fort,RAC,"As I writ to your Worship yesterday by Doctor Griffins boy was what I understood in this affaires, but upon receipt of yours immediatly I went to John Cabess and lay'd before him, as you was pleased to order, all the inconveniences he would certainly involve himselfe in, by deserting the ffreindship hee and especially his father had so long been subservient to, telling him nothing would be more displeasureable to your Worship, or a greater detrement to the Royall Company than making his house a factory for the French. At this he seem'd very much concern'd, assuring me he never received any goods from the French upon any such account, very well knowing that he would lay down his life for the English, as his father had done before him. His cozen being present, sent to him from the Generall of the Mine, hereing this it rais'd a great dispute between them, in fine he bid his cozen goe tell the Generall of the Mine he would not come to him, but if your Worship was pleas'd to send for him he would most readily obey your comands, he owning himselfe a servant to none but the English. These are his pretentions, which I hope are reall, and if I here any thing to the contrary I shall presently inform your Worship. There is none but one of there men on shoar here, which is an English man left to look after their caske. The king has given them a pawn on board, and what for I can[not] learne."
792,2,152,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,26/03/1686,Fort,RAC,"By all that I can learne and have inquired into since the reception of yours, cant find in all was objected against John Cabess, anything of realty, but that was falcely surmised, as well as informd your Worship. The French indeed went up to the king at Great Commenda with a design to gett a settlement here or at Ampena; but here the king would not grant it, this place being as he told them already settled by the English and Dutch. What they may doe at Ampena another year I cant learne, but beleive they will endeavour to gett a settlement their. The pawn they have on board is as John Cabess beleives for some goods they have trusted the king: he has sett his people to worke upon his canoe and as soone as done will come down and weight upon your Worship at Cape Coast, which will be in a day or two, being alwaies ready upon the first summons, as he tells me, to obey your Worships comand. The English man here on shoare belonging to the French ship has a great desire to serve your Worship either on shoare or at sea if you are pleas'd to entertain him."
793,2,153,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,30/03/1686,Fort,RAC,"By William Bedford I have sent this months account and money the ballance being 3mk 3oz 0a 6ta. Our takeings would be greater if you please to allow of cratra mony, and therefore have sent down enclosed with the rest 1oz 8a for a pattern. Nuna tells me tis good mony and that they never refuse it at the Dutch factory, which makes their takens greater than ours. Here is occasion for some sheets, and blew perpetuanoes, but no cano fitting to send for them. In the caske of knives received from on board the Anne Sloop, no.508, found wanting eleaven dozen and six knives; but the bill amoung them according to invoyces sent me specified 110 dozen, which made us tell them over againe to sure, yett affter twice telling found them wanting. Captain Nuna desires your Worship would be pleased to send him an order to receive his pay here from the time due, for he sayes all his concerns being at Cape Coast he is forced to live upon the charrity of other people here, which is very true, though he comes and eats with me, and has anything he wants when he pleases to. I dont understand what John Cabess intends to doe. When first I made known your Worships desire, he shew'd himselfe extreamly forward and ready, but since I have been at him every day and he puts me of from time to time soe that I cant [learn?] where [= whether] he designs to come or not."
794,2,154,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,02/04/1686,Fort,RAC,"These are to desire your Worship to send some boysadoes and another cask of knives with the sheets and perpetuanoes I writt for by William Bedford, for yesterday I disposed of what remaynes, excepting some few which are soe eaten with rust I am afraid they will hardly goe off at all."
795,2,155,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,03/05/1686,Fort,RAC,"By Nuna I have sent down my monthly account for last month and desire your Worship to send more niconees broad, course sletias, and tapseiles broad, and narrow, which is what I have occasion for at present. Our knives proved extraordinary rusty in last cask, I have disposed of some of them as you ordered but beleive if we had a grind stone here, might make them more vendible. Captain Nuna desires your Worship would be pleas'd to grant him an order for his wages to be paid either here or at Cape Coast, he being in great want of itt. Yesterday noon a small Portugues vessell came to an anchor at Ampena and the French sloop in this road, both from leward."
796,2,156,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,07/05/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yours with the goods per the Anne Sloop I have received and gott safe on shoar, the Captain of the French sloop assisting me with his boate, elce it had been impossible without opening the caskes, for here are not other than two hand canos, therefore if your Worship be so pleased to order, I think a three or five hand cano may be very convenient for the use of the factory and beleive I may gett one to windward. I here one of the Company ships [is] at Succondee and has been arrived there these three dayes, I am told shee is a small vessell and the Captain never here before, which is what I know at present, and understand per the Ann Sloop you have had noe news of her, [which] makes me give your Worship the trouble of these lines, desireing to be excused in my negligence of last writeing, which was occasiond [by] nothing of moment or business presenting."
797,2,157,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,11/05/1686,Fort,RAC,"Nuna hearing of his house being burnt at Cape Coast desires liberty for two or three dayes, to look affter his affaires their, which occasions his coming now: by him I have now inclosed sent you one bendy, which is due to him for eight months sallery. I understand [he] is further indebted to your Worship so shall stop his pay as it becomes due till further orders. I here of an English ship to windward and suppose it may be Captain Pickard, in the Hunter, by what I understand by Captain Walkers mate. Here is little mony stirring at present but the merchant tells me their will be in a very short time a good trade, for gold and slaves both."
798,2,158,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,21/05/1686,Fort,RAC,"I gave you the troble of a few lines by Nuna on the 11th of this instant, he desireing to goe to Cape Coast for three or four dayes, hereing his house was burnt, and by him sent your Worship one bendy as you was pleased to order me, due for his
sallery here, as likewise as five angles, two taccoes to Mr Humfryes, wanting to the ballance of my last months account, but haveing noe news of him since, and he promising to return speedily, makes me humbly presume to give you this troble againe. I design'd to wait upon your Worship and the Gentlemen at Cape Coast, but the weather proveing very rainey and the sea growing high, I am told it is not altogether safe comeing, but I wish you all a merry Whitesontide and that all health and happiness may ever be your attendance. I have heard noe news since of the ship I wrote you in my last was at Dickecove, soe beleive it may prove a mistake."
799,2,159,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,25/05/1686,Fort,RAC,"The enclos'd coming last night to my hands, I have sent to give you notice of Captain Pickards arrivall, and by a canoe from John Cabess I have endeavourd to answer his expectations, giveing the best inteligence I could both of the prises of goods on shoar and on board ship. Captain Pickard sends his humble servis to your Worship."
800,2,160,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,13/06/1686,Fort,RAC,"Here is occasion for some more sheets, iron bars, broad nicconees and rum for the use of the factory, which with another role of tobacco I desire your Worship will be pleased to send per first conveniency. Our trade is but small, this place seldom being without shipping, where they must dispose of their cargo at easy rates for a quick dispatch or in liing [= lying] long for higher prizes the charges of the ship will exceed the profitt of the goods, thus I have heard them speak, yett if your Worship is pleased to consider they hinder the factory ashore, and especily this place, which occasions the prizes of our goods to be lower than as I understand elcewhere, besides the merchants here, if I may call them soe, take the cuntrey peoples mony and raise their gains from them as well on shoar as on board ship, which makes them the harder with us. I have since I came up last kept the broad nicconess at 4a. For the narrow tapseiles they offer me but 3a, I allow them 312<math id=""actrade-9780197262528-math-17"" display=""inline"">

801,2,161,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,17/06/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yours I have received with the goods according to invoyce, and sent back three
cases, which are what I can conveniently spare at present. The goods came last will goe of apace, if a ship dont come and take away our trade. Here is likewise wanting some sheets, which they inquire much after. I sent Mr Bucknells letter away by a two hand cano, as your Worship was pleas'd to order. The sloop lies a little to windward of this roade. I have no more to troble you with at present."
802,2,162,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,18/06/1686,Fort,RAC,"The inclosed came last night from Mr Bucknell who desired me to send it to your Worship, being an answer to that you sent. I have had an indefferent trade since those last goods came up, and beleive they will not lie long upon hand, especially the iron barrs, if a ship dont come and spoil all. There is a flying report of ships to windward but hear nothing of certainty."
803,2,163,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,21/06/1686,Fort,RAC,"I received the factory and goods here at the rate I have since charg'd them in my account. I wish your Worship and Councill had been pleas'd to set the distinct of every [in]dividiall sort of goods sooner, and I am sure I should observ'd your order. The broad nicconees were no comodity but since when as in my last account I found them goe off, I left word upon coming down the other day to waite upon your Worship that none should be disposed of under 4a, to which price have kept them. Tis trew I never had any order for the selling them or any other goods at any set prices, and am mightily mistaken, if I have not follow'd the same as they were charged at before I came, and hope I may be the more excusable if your Worship will be pleas'd to understand that the town blacks, by takeing the cuntrey mens mony and bringing it to the factory, gett what I humbly presume you may surmise. I doe leave all to your Worships and Councells consideration."
804,2,164,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,22/06/1686,Fort,RAC,"William Bedford hath been taken these three dayes with a feaver. At first it seemd little but yesterday he was dangerously ill, so that I was afraid of him, today he is a little better. I apply the best kitching physick I can, haveing no other. The role of tobacco is dispos'd of, it was charged at 5 lb per angle containing 221 lb weight, I sold it at five fathom per la, the fathom containing 6 foot. I know not where [= whether] there may be a mistake in the weight or how tis, but I have not made the mony by 6a and better, this being the first, I put all the mony together by itselfe,
to se how it hold out. I humbly desire if your Worship please an answer to what I writ per your man."
805,2,165,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,25/06/1686,Fort,RAC,I understand by a Dutch Companys ship that passed by yesterday that there are two pyrots to windward of Cape Appilonia. He saw besides two Dutch interlopers but no English ship. I thought it my duty to give your Worship an account of this.
806,2,166,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,04/07/1686,Fort,RAC,"By Captain Nuna I have sent my Junes account with the mony, and have occasion for some boysadoes, sheets, knives, herba longees, small checkerd, and lead bars; of the two last be pleased to send the prizes. The knives, as I wrote your Worship, prov'd extraordinary rusty. What you send now if good, will goe off apace. I gave Nuna a say when he went last for Cape Coast, for which he told me he could not buy a good five hand canoe, which is extreamly wanting for the use of the factory, for if the goods come per the Ann Sloop, here is noe gitting them ashoar without one, I therefore desire your Worship would be pleased to speak to him about it, for I suppose his man he sent may be come back againe ere this. Next week dancing time as they call it begins, at Great Commenda, and I have had severall invitations from the king to come up. There is some custom to be paid, as a cloth to himself and the Ffetera c, besides brandy, all which I leave to your Worships consideration. I sent just now on board the Dutch interloper to inquire what shipping were at St Thoma when he was there, who sent me word he saw no English ship since he has been gon, but left one Dutch interloper at Cape Apilona. Here are three of them in this roade."
807,2,167,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,06/07/1686,Fort,RAC,"These are to desire your Worship to send some good sayes with the other goods sent for, if you can afford them at 14 angles. Doctor Griffin sent to me to buy one anchor of brandy for him on board the Dutch interloper, which I have done. The Captain sent me the enclosed, which I showd to the Dutch, and find he has made me pay one angle more than he sells to the Blacks, the reason is as I understand from them that he was panyard last voyage by the English pyrate and is therefore resolved to take sattisfaction of the first Companyes ship they meet with. On Sunday last they went from hence and keept all three together upon that design if tis trew as I here. I desire your Worship would be pleased to send the bearer back
again as soon as possible because I shall want him. Your tobacco goes of at a little a time because it is very bad and the Dutch have that which is good, but dont question but shall dispose of it before the month be up. Here wass [sic] the Little Phiscall of the Mine today and he would have keept this noate, if I would have lett him. I dont know the meaninge of it."
808,2,168,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,07/07/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yours with the goods I have received, but se no perpetuanoes unless it be among the nicconees, which have not open'd, haveing no conveniency of stowing them at present. I have sent herein inclosed 14a as I received it for a say, because find the mony I send down wants 6a in weight which was great weight by my scales; you cant expect that I should take the weight as at the Castle. I am forcd often to take theirupon an equall ballance, because they should not carry it away again. The 14a with one by itselfe are for the ballance of the errors that were in the 25 nicconees, 102 sheets and 85 dozen knives, which I desire you would be pleased to se rectified. I have sent the king word what you are pleased to allow and when I receive an answer, I shall give your Worship an account. I have sent the inclosed and desire a receipt upon it for the ballance, as likewise for the ballance of the four last months accounts."
809,2,169,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,10/07/1686,Fort,RAC,"These inclosed came from Mr Bucknell, which he desired me to send your Worship with all speed. Last night there came down a ship with English coullers aboard and anchored to windward of Comenda hill. I sent a cano of thinking it one of the Company ships, who brought me word she was a Portuguez. This morning she weighd and stands down. I would have sent a cano againe but cant gett the blacks to goe today, they say she is a pyrate and are all afraid to goe on board her. Here lyes the Ann Sloop windbound, she has let her alone and I beleive for all this she is a Portuguez. There came no perpetuanoes with the other goods, I therefore desire you would be pleas'd to send a blew one for the king, with what elce you have allowd, he will be sattisfied as John Cabess tels me. Here is a fair proffer of a trade, and [need] for another man that can write, for when I have business, William Pigg not reading my noats I am afraid will make a mistake in my warehouse. John Cabess has a great mind for Benjamin Broadgate to come againe, whome I found very faithfull when here before, and desire if you are pleased to send him up be pleased to send the price of the lead bars and herba longees."
810,2,170,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,17/07/1686,Fort,RAC,"Haveing this opertunity by John Cabeses cano, these are to desire your Worship to send some sayes, pray lett them be good and they will goe of at 14a. I have been very ill but thanks be to God am something better at present."
811,2,171,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,20/07/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yours with the goods I have received, vizt fourty sayes, twendy [sic] five blew perpetuanoes, fourty green and red ditto, thirty five peices of narrow nicconees, and ten broad stript sattins, which I shall indeaver to dispose of to the Royall Companyes best advantage. I have paid the king his custom, as you were pleas'd to order, which has well enough pleased him. Here is no news stirring at present."
812,2,172,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,30/07/1686,Fort,RAC,"I have here sent per Nuna my mony and accounts, the ballance being 7mk 3o 4a. Yesterday I had it well pickt and blowd and dont question but it is very good gold. Here is a prospect of a trade now, and since Mr Chambers was here to servey the ground all the people are very desireous we should have a fortificasion and will give their assistance in what they can towards it. John Cabess desires me to lett you know so much, and sayes whatsoever you are pleas'd to command he will ffaithfully serve you. The sattins would have all sold if they had all been red and stript, the other sort they dont like. There is one wants about a fathom and halfe, which has been cut off. The perpetuanoes goe of a blew and green, I keept them up at a blew, green and redd but could not dispose of them at that rate. Here is occasion for some niconees broad, sattins, and as many blew perpetuanoes as wants to put of the green and redd I last received, or elce they will lye upon my hands."
813,2,173,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,05/08/1686,Fort,RAC,"These are to lett you know that I have had a good trade for three or four dayes, the cuntrey people begining to come down, and desire your Worship to send some [omission] pound basons and their price, with those goods I sent for by Nuna, vizt nicconees broad, stript sattins and some perpetuanoes, which will help of with other goods. I have likewise occasion for a blowpan if you have any to spare. William Pigg is taken very ill and desires to come downe, be pleasd therefore to send another man with the goods, one that writes."
814,2,174,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,06/08/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yours with the goods I have received, and hope shall meet with a speedy saile for them as well to your Worship as the Royall Company sattisfaction, and shall observe your order in sending timely for a supply of what goods I shall have occasion for here. William Pigg is pretty well againe, he seemes not to like this place so have lett hime come down againe."

I had the news from a black who has been aboard a Portuguez vessell now at Succondee that saw him to windward. I return your Worship many thanks for the piggeons you was pleased to send me."
816,2,176,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,01/09/1686,Fort,RAC,"Per Nuna I have sent down last months mony and my accounts. I should have meett with a good trade had not so many ships arriv'd, but beleive in a shorte time trading will come again and then shall advise what goods are wanting, finding no occasion at present. I bought a very good man slave for seaven peas, which I sent on board Captain Brandfill, desireing him to bring him down to your Worship, and have here inclosed sent his receipt."
817,2,177,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,03/09/1686,Fort,RAC,"I had sent yesterday but a pallaver happening by turning a black out who made some disturbance in the house, was as I understand about palm wine, for I was gon to look on some corn for Captain Poston, but returning presently and finding all in an uproar and inquireing the matter found the stons and clotts [= clods] begin to fly about me, upon which I made our people secure him and sent for the Cabushers to know if they would suffer us to be thus abused, but affter a long pallaver I was contented the ffellow should beg pardon, which he did, and I thought all had been at peace and quietness again, but at night after twas a little dark this ffellow bring a parcell of rouges [= rogues] with him fireing their guns, shot and all, at us as they came along, designing some mischeif had not they been timely prevented per the people here who were presently up in armes, but it being dark they could not find them. I am advised per John Cabess and the Cabushers to send up to the king about it as well as to your Worship, for I here they design some further."
818,2,178,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,06/09/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday I sent John Cabess and Captain Nuna to the king at Great Comenda, who acquainted him with the insolences of those ffellows, that dared abuse us; which the king was very much troubled at, protesting they should be severly punished and sent away to command them before him the next morning [and] orderd John Cabess upon any such affront immediately to send him the offenders head. Tomorrow as I hear there will come one from the king heither to give your Worship further sattisffaction, this day being spent in pallavers and debates about it, understand they are all ready to give their assistance as soon as you send Doctor Griffin to treat about a ffortification. I have occasion for some nicconees broad and narrow, they goeing of againe, which I desire you would be pleased to send per first opertunity."
819,2,179,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,08/09/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yours per the nine hand cano I have received with the goods, but there falls short in the broad nicconees twenty one pieces, for upon twice telling them over we found no more than seaventy nine. I began to fear as much before, seing the bail so loose, which made me open it before I took it into the warehouse, that all might be wittnesses, and because you write you have but few left and would have me dispose these the best I can, I think it convenient to keep them up at 412<math id=""actrade-9780197262528-math-18"" display=""inline"">

I have sent Captain Nuna down to look affter the sayes I gave him to buy a 3 or 5 hand cano for the use of the ffactory, as your Worship was pleas'd to order, which is now about 3 months agoe, and he tells me the man is not come back yett which he sent, and is willing to se affter him himselfe. The king yesterday sent me a sheep for farther sattisfaction about this pallaver, which I have sent your Worship herewith."

Here is twenty seaven narrow nicconees, three broad ditto, ffive sayes, and what knives remayn, all very much damniffied. They are as received, be therefore pleas'd to send those that are good and order how these must be disposed off. The blacks have made a great pallaver about John Cabess his being panyard by the Dutch, being resolvd to have him again or them here suffer. This has brought most of the trade to me, all the merchants and Capushers being very invetterate against them upon this account. As I was writing your Worships letter of this date came to my hands, and understand nothing farther John Cabesses business than what I write before. The Capushers and people upon their pallaver made the Dut[c]h Copeman here write to the Generall yesterday to know the reason why he panyard him; and not receiveing a satisfactory answer, and made him write againe today. As soon as we know the truth, his wiffe will send to your Worship, hopeing your Worship will be pleasd to shew some kindness to him, if tis upon account of serveing the English. I will sent what mony I have per the great cano. I thought to have sent it by Benjamin Broadgate but I suppose the other way is more saffe. Here just now came a man from John Cabess, who sent me word that the Dutch have panyard him to make him serve them, which he sayes he will never yeild to. Benjamin Broadgate can sattisfie your Worship further."

Upon Doctor Griffin moveing it to the people here, they told him they were the kings subjects and servants, and whatsoever commands he should lay upon them, they will readily obey, whether in carrying stones, bricks or doeing anything elce that may forward your Worships intentions in building here; but the pallaver must be first made at Great Commenda, and when that is done, everything is compleat'd."

you may send slaves to break stone to be in a reddyness against the bricks come and build as you think most advantagious, but they admitt of no great guns. Tis to these two men the two cloths must be given, I told your Worship of when last at Cape Coast Castle. I have occasion for some more iron barrs, and if your Worship shall think it convenient, you may send them and the slaves with one trouble in the same cano. Here are remayning twenty nine sayes, all more or less damnified, which I offer together at thirteen angles per piece but cant dispose of them so. I suppose at 12a they may goe of but I shall lett that alone till I here from your worship, which I hope will be tomorrow, or elce the people will be gon into the cuntrey, which will hinder the sayle of them, for I find the trade here begins to declyn."

The iron barrs dont sell well now, especially since the price is raisd. I have occasion for some boysadoes, broad nicconees if you have any or else send narrow, carpitts, and some good sayes.
Last night I received a great abuse from John Cabess for nothing at all, as Mr Bayly can sattisfie; he strick me thrice in the face and once that I fell to the ground, and after all (if he could) would have sent me away. This morning I made the pallaver, calling all the merchants and Cabushers, who all took my part, Cabess haveing nothing to say for himselfe. I told them I would have sattisfaction, which they say I shall; and left it to your worship what to impose, hopeing that if they are not soe good as their words, which I dont much question, you will have an opertunity some time or other to nabb him elcewhere. He pretends to serve the English, and doth quite contrary, but I made him stoop today. This morning likewise I gave the cloth, one halfe to the king and the other to the Ffetera, and a gingham to the kings cheife man, that being what they demanded as a custom upon building, which I thought was best to give than to hinder [ms. 'kinder'] the worke. I have sent one of the roles of tobacco which I find to be rotten within side, and not vendable. This morning came here the Generall of the Mine with a great train to visitt his ffactory."
833,2,193,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,06/11/1686,Fort,RAC,"The slaves tooles being broake about their work, have sent them down to be mended; they have plyed their buisness pritty well and gott up a parcell of verry good stones. I understand since the Generall of the Mine was here he came to survey their ground and house, intending to make a fforte of itt, he was likewise to see our ground. John Cabess is very sorry and much ashamed of what he hes done, and sayes he will pay what your Worship shall be pleased to impose, and ever after will serve us soly and faithfully, hoping you will not be to severe upon him for this one time. I have since found him verry respectefull and much humbled but shante forgive him without your Worships order."

If you have any more blew perpetuanoes be pleased to send some, as likewise sheets, by the sloope.

I have found him experimentaly servicable aboutt John Cabesses buisnes; and he lookes carffully affter building to see that nothing is stole and I dont question his assistance in the foresaid affare, for all which to encourage him, I told him I would writte to your worshipe that he might be entred into the Companys service att 4a per month, which if you please to grante, as I thinke itt extreamly nessesary, I am sure he will save and geett the Company above foure bendyes per month, for not only this, butt he is a greatt trader and bringes to the ffactory most of the money comes through his hands.

Whith this comes my October account, but I have not left out the tobacco, because I am debter for it in September, butt for the flitter shall sende the money to John Downes and shall take care to dispose of the narrow tapseiles according to order. Here lyes the broad blew bafftes cam laste, they dont goe off at 4a. If they had been black, I should have had none left by this time."

Bee pleased to send some niccanees, more powder and one pound pewtter bassons if theare bee any, as soone as with conveniency you canne, and pray lett the baile of narrow niccanees be discounted that theare may bee noe hearafter mistake, or trouble. The place weare I putt the powder is the warehouse in Captain Braughtons house where Mr Chambers formerly was, where I likewise putt the paper brawles, till I finde they will sell, thinking itt nott convenient to returne them. I am now providing for my goeing up to the king of Aguaffo tomorrow, to end the pallaver about the house, which I hope I shall soe well conclud[e] that itt shall bee both for the Royall Companys and your worships and Councills satisfaction. I finde itt will bee to my noe little charge and likewise hope you in them will consider and nott to lett me beare the extreamitty of itt. Mr Eansworth and another man from the Mina are goeing just now up to the king. I doe nott know theire buissness butt hope itt is nott to intercept any thinge of ours, because hee knows I am to goe tomorrow, butt if itt is I beeleive hee will loose his labour. Bee pleased to send the contents of the baile of paper brawles and the prices, for I have nott opened them."

I have nott tyme to acquaint you with all our proceedings now, butt you shall have the full by Captain Quow, and only send these to prevent further charges, hearing Doctor Griffen and Mr Chambers is to goe to the King tomorrow, which would have signified noething, if I had nott went in the nature I did."
846,2,206,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,08/12/1686,Fort,RAC,"In order to your commands on Munday morning early I sett out with John Cabess and Captain Quow to end the pallaver about the house with the king of Agaffo, where we arrived by 10 of the clock and were conducted to the Mareens house, presently after we had audience of the king, Fettera &ca, where affter some little entertainment we were dismist, and told we should have a hereing on the morrow morning, and were conducted to the Mareens, haveing there refreshed our selves, comes one to me to know what presents I had brought with me for the king, Ffetera and Tagee. Now being forwarned that my not comeing up and bringing those presents which is usuall upon such accompts had occasiond the hindrance of our building, and the pallaver could never be ended otherwise, I accordingly provided my selfe and sent each of them and their wives a present, which was verry well accepted. In short the morrow being come, we were sent for, where were present only the king, Fettera and Affer Tagee, with one or two more of their attendance. I ffully layd before them all your Worships demands and took their answers in writeing, where affter some debates it was ordred
In primis, That we should build our house in what manner and forme we pleased and have a mudd or stone wall about it, but noe great gunns att top.
Item, That the Commenda people shall fetch up the stones for the mony owing about the fformer building in Agent Greenhills time and that we only give them drinck;
Itim, That if any of our slaves make their escape he shall use the utmost of his power for the regaining them
Itim, That none of the Commenda Cabusheers shall ever hereafter send any of the Royall Companys servants away without the consent of the Agent Generall at Cabo Corso Castle, and that if any white man abuse the blacks, they are to make their complaints as aforesaid.
Postremo, That noe person or persons presume to make any further pallaver about this building upon any pretence whatsoever so as to demand any other custome more then the ten sayes, and that the Agent Generall order the building as he shall thinke most advantagious for the use of the Royall Company without any lett or molestation, great guns only excepted.
Upon this the king desired that the tenn sayes should be presently payed, and that when the house is ffinished he may be allowed something per month as an acknowledgment and that if he sends cracra mony the ffacter may have an order to take it, and be payed his yearly custome at the danceing time.
To the first of which I have agreed, finding after he had been soe civill to me I should have very much provocked him if I had persisted ffarther, and told him I did not question but your Worship would grant the rest.
Upon this they signed the articles and delivered them to me in the name of your Worship, the king and both Ffeteras, first kissing them. In like manner I delivered them your, so that I think the contract is firmly enough established, and we have nothing to doe more but to go on with our work as fast as we can.
I thought it convenient to give your Worship a full account of all our proceedings, and lett you know that if I had went up empty handed the business would never have been ended or at least brought to that perffection tis, soe that I hope you will be pleased to allow my charges, which were noe more then what meer necessity itselfe required, yett far to great for me to bare. I shall troble you no farther at present, only hope that what I have now done is to your Worship and Councells sattisfaction, and shall ever remayne, I have sent the 7 hand cano for some narrow nicconees, powder sheets and one pound basons iff their be any, the two pounder dont sell at 3 lb per angle."
847,2,207,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,09/12/1686,Fort,RAC,"By the 7 hand cano I have received one baile of narrow nicconees, quantity 120, and twelve barells of powder. This morning with Mr Elwes and Mr Halford I took an account of the warehouse and all the Royall Company concerns here in order to your Worships commands. Yesterday, I sent the 7 hand cano, and want more narrow nicconeees, sheets and one pound basons [ms. 'basasons']. For powder we have enough at present."

I received the bale of narrow nicconees and three casks of two pound basons by the 7 hand canoe, but there were twenty wanting in one caske no.38, as per certificatte. This with my humble service to your worship and Councill is all at present from [myself], only I have sent another copie of November account."

I have more money by mee of John Cabesses, and others which is not blowed nor weighed, and he being gone to the Mina cant send itt now. Last Ffriday I paid the King the tenn sayes according to the contract and on Satterday ffollowing he sente the Ffette[r]a to call all the Commenda Cabusheers to Aguaffoe, and hes ordered them to begin ffetching up of our stones one [= on] Tuesday next. Wee have three great heapes, and those that are very good, and only want the workmen. What pewter caske for the future comes shall be returned, the other I gave to the people that bougt the basons. By this canoe came likwise Mr James Wheeler whome I shall treat civilly, and give him incouragement according as I finde him careffull of the Royall Companys concerns. Att Christmass I thinke to kiss your worships hande. I have sent downe what empty cases, caskes &c I have by mee. Two of the weomen slaves, Agaba and Mandeloe, asked leave on Satterday to goe to Caboe Corsoe and are not retturned yett."

Bantam. Yesterday by order from the king of Aguaffo, we had some of our stones brought up, and tomorrow he has also ordered the Mereen to stop the canomen and sett them to bring up the rest, as fast as they can."

As for Edward Jacklins sallery I allowed it him the last and these two months to stock him selfe with cloths, or elce he must have went naked, and for the 1oz 8a given to the king of Aguaffos officers and souldiers I hope your Worship will be pleasd to allow, for Ile [= I'll] assure you it is not 13<math id=""actrade-9780197262528-math-20"" display=""inline"">

The slave I sent down I took not as a pawn, but bought him outright and have often sent to know where [= whether] they would redeem him, but never heard from them and where to find them now I cannot tell. Here are all things ready if you please to send the workmen to goe fforward to the building before the rains come, and if there is not stone enough broak the slaves can break near as much more before this will be layd, but the Cabushers are very unreasonable in their demands about bringing them up, for they will have mony as well as drink, which because I would not give them there is part of the stones lye behind, but yesterday I sent up a man to the king
about it, who is very much displeased with them, and will send an officer down today to have the remaynes of the stones brought up and further the building in everything according to contract. I received but 16 two pound basons instead of nineteen."
856,2,216,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,08/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date I have received and shall observe your orders. I payd Edward Jacklin his last two months sallery and have lett him have 8a as I wrote towards his cloths till next pay day, and desire to know where [= whether] I must stop all his sallery for the future or allow him dyett. By the bearer I have sent one crow and two wedges that wants mending. Yesterday a Cabusher of Aguaffo came down by order of the king to look affter the bringing up of our stones and the Tatea was sent about to stop the canomen and this morning accordingly they went to work, but affter they had brought about 13<math id=""actrade-9780197262528-math-21"" display=""inline"">

I will endeavour to gett it done for a peaz or two and that to be paid when all the stones are brought. I layd the case down playn enough if they had eether since [= sense] or reason. Here is a Brandenburge came to an anchor, and we here their is a French ship to windward with materialls to build at Ampena."
857,2,217,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,13/11/1687,Fort,RAC,"These are to desire you to send a bail or two of narrow nicconees, two or three hundred three pound basons, some sheets if any, and twenty flowered silk longees for John Cabess if you can afford them at 5a per piece, and if their is anything elce that you think may sell pray be pleased to send it. I have not had so quick a dispatch as I used to have because my Arcania merchants are not come down yett, and what mony is brought to the town people they send on board the French ship now at Succondee. Your Worship was speaking I remember of building a house for the slaves and now here is a very good house of an Arcanyes lately deceasd to be
disposed of over against ours and likewise the windwardmost house, for which they ask one ounce, which will be cheaper considering the loss of time than such a one can be built. With this comes two coppies of December account and by the return of the cano you shall have the 1oz 8a that is due to ballance."
858,2,218,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,14/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"The occasion of my writeing is to desire that you would be pleasd to order the mending of these wedges and their return as soon as possible, for these are all we have, and that you would send the goods I write for with all convenient speed."

I should have continued my trade had not the arrivall of these ships put a stop to it, but I hope shall have it againe after their departure. I have taken two bales narrow nicconees of Mr Bayly and received them by the cano, which I beleive will goe off if no other shipping comes down upon the head of these, with my humble servis to your Worship and Councell and continuall prayers for your health and prosperity is what offers at present

I have bin of late somewhat out of order but am upon the recovery of my health againe, I thank God, only a little troubled with the toothach."
861,2,221,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,26/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"Last night here came to an anchor in this roade a small vessell, being an interloper from Barbadoes, and as I hear intends to corn, and gett what slaves he can, if not designs for Annamaboe. He has perpetuanoes and other goods on board, though tis given out only for rum and sugar. This morning passes by near two hundred Mine canoes to rout the French from Taccardo, and another party came affter to Ampena where they have taken away their boat and five men, that were left to look after her while the rest went on shore, and carried them to the Mine. They [= the
French] have been up with the king of Aguaffo and design a settlement there likewise and so along the Coast if not prevented. We here from the interloper that they have another ship to windward, which is all the vessels he saw. I thought it requisite to advise your Worship hereof, so I hope you will be pleasd to excuse this troble. I have occasion for some iron barrs and desire you would be pleased to send word where [= whether] I must pay Edward Jacklin any part of his sallery."
862,2,222,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,28/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours by the 11 hand cano I have received with the one hundred ninty and nine iron barrs, one falling short upon twice telling them over, first out of the cano and againe into the warehouse. I hope they are come to a good marquett, but they all keep up their mony in expectation of these shipping, when they hear of that is over I shall have a brisk trade againe. We are hard put to it for room, our warehouse not holding above one third of our goods, so that I am forced to lett the barrs, bailes, case[s], goods lye out in the next room, which makes me want conveniency of lodging for our people. The little interloper weighed yesterday morning and stood down."
863,2,223,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,03/02/1687,Fort,RAC,"By the bearer I have sent 5mk 13a which with the 6mk 3oz I sent before by Mr James Bayly makes 11mk 3oz 13a, being the ballance of last month[s] account. If shipping forbear comeing a little here will be againe a good trade on shore. I have likewise sent a coppy of my account, and you shall have another by the next convenience."
864,2,224,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,07/02/1687,Fort,RAC,"Here are lately come down the Arcania merchants with a new Captain, they haveing given and taken hostage of the king of Aguaffo for a trade and safe passage. They have bin with me and demand halfe a peice of say, and 3 gallons rum, for which I have agreed to pay this day, the Dutch paying the same yesterday. If your Worship pleases to order me some tallow and perpetuanoes I shall have a quick dispatch for them, and as to the stones I beleive their are near enough broak with the bricks that are here to finish the house, if you design it but forty foot long &c, but we shall want more lyme."
865,2,225,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,10/02/1687,Fort,RAC,"There is here happened a difference between we and the Dutch about the stone place, they takeing upon them to turn our slaves from the ground we have cleared, and stand so far in opposition as to tell us we shall break no more on the side of the river, the ground being theirs, which I suppose was occasioned by the Grandee Coopeman comeing heither from the Mine yesterday, they designing some quarrell with us, but they sent since to tell us they would give leave to carry up the remayns of our stons if we made hast, as if we must be beholding to them.
I humbly give your Worship and Councell this account first and shall lett them alone till I know your pleasure, being unwilling to be the author of any disturbance, though I am sure I can make my part as good as theirs at an howers warning, and not only so for it is a thing the king of Aguaffo will not suffer, he sending his man but the day before to turn them away. I have sent John Ratleife for your Worships farther satisfaction in this affair, and thinking the best way may be to acquaint the king with it or at least the Generall of the Mine, for they say it is per his order.
[PS] I have sent another coppy of my account."
866,2,226,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,12/02/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 10th instant I received and sett our slaves yesterday to breaking of stons as formerly, but today the Dutch has turnd them away pretending the ground and place to be theirs, which I have born with it being your Worships order that I should make no opposition but advise immediately. I have therefore accordingly sent the bearer away, this happening about eleaven a clock this morning. There is no enmity between Mr Ensworth and me as I know of but what is done by order of the Generall of the Mine. Now I suppose if the king of Aguaffo is acquainted with this he will not suffer their proceedings, for he sent and turnd them away once, as I wrote before, but I cant tell what pallaver they may have made with him since, their pretentions are that the place belongs to them as a wattering place and that they are now breaking stones to inclose itt with a wall, but that is only to cheat the black[s], their design being to gett a wall round their houses. It may be convenient that Mr Chambers come up (if your Worship and Councell shall please) and put the building forward, for I beleive theyr are near stones enough broak but the blacks have been very backward in bringing them up. I have hired them for Tuesday next and they have promised all their assistance.
The Arcanyes mised comeing down this week so that here has been but a small trade, but I here they will be all here on Munday.
I have bought a house over against the Factory containing six rooms for four damnified narrow nicconees vallued at about 112<math id=""actrade-9780197262528-math-22"" display=""inline"">

This morning early returnd Captain Nuna from Aguaffo, whome I sent up to acquaint the king of the insolency of the Dutch in presuming to turn our slaves from the place [that] was assigned us by him and his Cabushers, to break stone in, he brought word the king would suffer no quarrell between we and the Dutch and that the place formerly belonged to them, and they have since claimed it for a wattering place, but if he cant shew us as good a place as that he will make a pallaver with them and we shall goe their againe; in order to which the cheife Mereen is comeing down today from the king, who desires your Worship to send his silver headed stick. I have taken two rooms into one and fitted them with conveniency where I can put three or four hundred chests of corn, which I shall endeavour to purchase according to order. Here has been but very little trade of late, the Arcanyes not comeing down as formerly, but I here their pallaver is allmost ended. I have sent down by the return of this cano two women slaves which are uncapable of doeing the Royall Company any servis."
868,2,228,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,21/02/1687,Fort,RAC,"These comes by Captain Bristow, and are to acquaint your Worship that the foundation of the house is open and tomorrow Mr Chambers thinks to order the laying of the first stone, but he finds the ground so infirm that he desires you would be pleased to save what more plank there is and send it with all convenient expedition, and the men slaves we wrote for before. The blacks tell us we covett for stone when we have no need, for they expected a larger fabrick. The king will order us our stone place againe and has sent to me twice or thrice about. We are now sinking a hole and have found a very good spring of fresh water within pistole shott of the factory which will be very advantagious."
869,2,229,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,23/02/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of this days date between 3 and 4 of the clock this affternoon I have received and shall take care to send the cano and letter up to Succondee when shee comes, w[h]ere I here Captain Draper now is. I have made my pallaver with the Cabusheers &ca for corn, which they have promised at 112<math id=""actrade-9780197262528-math-23"" display=""inline"">

Mr Chambers present[s] his [service] to your Worship and will wait upon you on Satturday. The cano I here lyes at the Mine."
870,2,230,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,24/02/1687,Fort,RAC,"This accompanies Mr Chambers, who is desireous to waite upon you to know your further pleasure about the building. This morning arrived the 9 hand cano with the deals and plank, and understand by Mr Wheeler, that they would put in at the Mine whether he would or no, elce they might have been here yesterday, and now they are come they are so obstinate I cant gett them to goe to Succondee this morning, but will stay till they se their own time. I have not more to advise at present only I partly understand by the Cabusheers today that I shall have liberty to ship of corn according to order.
[PS] These are only to advise you that the cano stoped yesterday from 9 in the morning tell past night at the Mine for no occasion in the the world as I can tell but their faulce pretension of the wind blowing two hard, but I know had we continued on our way might have been here by 1 a clock that day, so I hope nothing will be payd to my charge therein.

871,2,231,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,27/02/1687,Fort,RAC,"The occasion of my writting now is to send the inclosed with all possible speed to your Worship and Councell, it being from Captain Draper, who came this evening to an anchor in our road about five of the clock. All that I have more to add, is to acquaint you that the people keep up their corn in expectation of a better marquett from the ship then [= than] on shoar, so that I gott but little as yett."
872,2,232,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,03/03/1687,Fort,RAC,"By thee bearer I have sent down last months mony and accompts, and by the next you shall have another coppy, till when I hope you will be pleased to excuse me, being a little indisposed. I have occasion for a hundred or two of iron barrs and what pewter you can spare. The merchants begin to come down as formerly, and the heate of shipping being a little over, makes me hope for a good trade again. We have gott three quines out of the ground, and are about the bass's of the flankers; the work might have been forwarder had we more hands; for we are forced to imploy two of our bricklayers to fetch stone. I have been at great charges to the people about bringing them up and notwithstanding all their fair promises, I never found them so good as their words. On Satterday they will goe to work again and I have promised them more palme wine for their incouragement. Mr Chambers desires you to send up as many more slaves as you can spare, for their is no trusting to these people, give them what you will."
873,2,233,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,08/03/1687,Fort,RAC,"This accompanyes Mr James Bayly in the Adventure Sloope, from whome I have supply'd the Factory with such goods as are chiefly wanting, only pewter he has none. I have likewise by him sent down twenty eight chests corn, which is all I had by me, the people not being so good as their words in bringing in their corn according to promis, and when they do will give them but little better than strickt measure by a chest out of the warehouse. I shall endeavour to purchase what I can and have hopes of a considerable quantity in a short time, but I partly find they keep up their corn in expectation of raising it, hearing it is very scarse to leward. Mr Chambers desires you would be pleased to send some more slaves with all convenient expedition, which would very much forward our work."
874,2,234,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,14/03/1687,Fort,RAC,"These from [= by] Mr Chambers are to acquaint you that we have gott the square above ground, and are goeing on with the flankers with all possible speed, and that we shall want some more lime old plank; and the dore cases, which we desire you would be pleased to order by first opertunity. Here is an indifferent trade, the road being seldom free from Dutch interlopers."
875,2,235,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,15/03/1687,Fort,RAC,"Haveing severall times received severall abuses from Mr Wheeler since his comeing up, but more especially last night when he took upon him to hector and huff me as he pleased and to tell me he would turn me out of the Factory, makes me at this time humbly give your Worship and Councill this accompt of his behaviour. His whole endeavour is I find to defame me as he can, and he has don openly now; what before he did by way of detraction to the Dutch man; his design I suppose is to gett the Factory; but that is not at all takeing with the people here, by whose instigation I cheifly send this, being very unwilling to make any complaint was not I very much necessitated to it. I shall troble your Worship and Councill noe further at present, only desire you would be pleased to take this into consideration. Be pleased to send twelve barrells powder, six chest of sheets and what pewter you can spare by the first oppertunity."

These are to accompany Mr Wheeler, who comes down according to your Worships order, and I desire you would be pleased to give him a full hearing in every thing he has to say against me, and if I am found faulty I humbly submitt to your Worship and Councells censure; he has taken upon him to demand the warehouse out of my hands, which I was unwilling to grant till he had finished some other business about my books I put him upon, and this was the first occasion of our disagreeing, but the other night he was so high with me as to abuse me by opprobrious words as he pleased. Since he has been more submissive and seems to be sorry for what he has done, and if he will beg your Worships and Councells pardon, and promis to mind only the Companies business, I am willing to receive him again with all the kindness and respect I showed him at his first coming, for I find he is a person fitting to serve them and assist me.
The Allegator Sloope arrived here yesterday in the afternoon; and if you have any blew perpetuanoes be pleased to send a bail or two of perpettuanoes by the return of this cano, and the bulces."
877,2,237,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,22/03/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 15th of this instant by Mr Pepperell I received, with the goods and other materialls therein mentioned, and by the return of the sloope have sent down eighty five chests of corn, which is what I had by me, but shall endeavour to purchase what more may be as fast as I can. There comes a crow which wants mending, and Mr Chambers would have it made flatt at both ends, and sent by the
first conveniency, with three new wedges. By what I understand here, Captain Gold may be to windward, if not now at Succondee, for we heard the gunns this morning. Yours of the 18th instant by Mr James Wheeler I have likewise received with one baile of blew perpetuanoes."
878,2,238,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,23/03/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the same instant came this night to my hand, and accordingly I have sent the enclosed to Mr Bucknell at Succondee and shall endeavour to buy up all the corne, that I can possible gett at the rate mentioned. Mr Chambers is a little indisposed, and thinks to wait upon your Worship on Satterday if he can come down.
With convenienceys that which is cheifly wanting to the building is the crows, wedges, lime, bricks and stone, these here being almost worked up. I hear of a Dean and Pourtugueze to windward, but noe English ship. Stones are the cheifest materialls we want, and are setting the slaves to break more."
879,2,239,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,25/03/1687,Fort,RAC,"This serves cheifly for a cover to the enclosed, being only to desire some more blew perpetuanoes and sheets, what you can spare, and rum for the use of the Factory, when the sloope comes up. I have had an indifferent good trade, and shall gitt corn apace I hope; but I am forced to pay mony for most of itt and take little better than striked [= strict] measure."
880,2,240,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,28/03/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 26th instant with the goods according to invoyce I have received, and hope they are come to a good marquett. As soon as the month is up shall send down my account and mony."
881,2,241,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,31/03/1687,Fort,RAC,"This comes by the return of the nine hand cano, which brought up ten deal boards and six women, two boyes and two girl slaves, but Mr Chambers tells me there is wanting Sayes wench and Boffery and Pishepans two daughters, which should have come up now according as your Worship ordered. We have sett them all to work, and hope the building will go apace, which we endeavour to forward with all convenient expedition. On Satturday or Munday at farthest I shall send down my mony and accounts, and then write for such goods as I find occasion for. I have near 80 chests of corn by me, and hope shall gett as much more, by the latter end of next weak."
882,2,242,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,02/04/1687,Fort,RAC,"These come by Nathaniell Western, by whome I have sent last months account with the ballance, and by the next will send another coppy. The goods I have occasion for are blew perpettunaoes, three bailes; six chests sheets; two cases sayes; twenty whole firkins tallow; one hundred paper brawles; which be pleased to send per the first opertunity. Yesterday send up Nuna to the King of Aguaffo; with an anchor of rum, as custome upon putting his corn in the ground, which is accepted kindly enough, and has promised send to send down 100 scaffold poles, but told him rum was a liquor the people there did not much care for, and desired an anchor of brandy more, and that should sattisfie him.
Here has been an indifferent good trade this month, and if your Worship and Councell are pleased to order an anchor of brandy amoung the merchants, I am certain twill not be lost, being an encouragement for them to bring their mony to the Factory,"
883,2,243,Samuel Chambers ,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,02/04/1687,Fort,RAC,"These are to give you an account of our proceedings in the building, which is forwarded with all possible expedition, haveing gott up the flankers almost even with the other work, which when is leaveld will rise a pace with bricks, which we must make use of amoungst the stone in the outside. The cheifest thing still wanting is stone, which breaks very hard, so desire you'l be pleased to send us as soon as possible a very large maull, and wedges, and a crow square pointed, for we are goeing on to break stone in two places. The next thing will be lyme, which I hope you'l supply within a short time. The slaves Bofferys girl and Pickinine, Sayes wife, are come here, which were wanting.
I understand we are promised some scaffling poles from the king, which will do us a kindness. I have nothing more to add at present, but will use my best endeavour in forwarding the work that it may go on with all expedition."
884,2,244,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,05/04/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 4th instant by the 11 hand canoe with one hundred blew perpetuanoes, three hundred and ninty sheets, two hundred and forty paper brawles, thirty whole ffirkins tallow, and twenty sayes, I have received, and hope they are come to a good marquett. By the return of the cano I have sent down 30 chests of corn, and as for cases here are none but what I make use of in the warehouse and about the corne.
Doctor Griffin parted from hence about ten this morning, intending for the Mina tonight, and tomorrow will waite upon your Worship at Cabo Corso."
885,2,245,Samuel Chambers ,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,05/04/1687,Fort,RAC,"This is to acquaint you that the greatest of our want is stones, which I have endeavourd as much as in me lyes, yett canot supply fast enough. I have advised with Mr Cross to set some of the slaves to gett some more thetch and cover the house; and then with your Worships leave desire to come to Cabo Corso tell there be a good quantity of stones broak and brought to the work. Pray send some more lym by the first opertunity."
886,2,246,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,22/04/1687,Fort,RAC,"These accompany Mr James Wheeler, who finding his distemper to increase desires to come down in time, hoping to finde a remidy att Caboe Corsoe Castle.
The people conserned in the pallavar about one angle in a bendy waited my coming up with longing expectations to know your worships pleasure in it; which when they found would not be allowed, brought them upon very high termes, in soe much they told mee they would brande our house and by a pallavar stope all traders from bringing any money to the ffactory, which pallavar they accordingly made yesterday, and since I have taken noe money. The authors of this are the Captain of the merchants, alias old Tom, and one Captain Petter. This is a verry unreasonable demand, when they themselves give the Duch what they requiree from us. I have sent to the King and he sayes the same and today will send downe aboute it. This with my humble service to your worship and Councill, wishing you your good health and prosperity, being all att present, only this pallavar if brought to perfection will be very disadvantagious to the Royall Affrican Companyes intrest."
887,2,247,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,27/04/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 20 instant by the Allegator Sloope I have received, with the goods and other materialls according to invoyce; and she had been downe soner had the weather been favorable while unlading. The trade is stopt still, and will be as far as I understand till there is some consideration alowed. But if it should come to that, which I thinke as unresonable as their demands, it may be alledged that whereas the Dutch have been the first promoters of this at Succondee and elce where, let them begin here, and your worship will give a sattisfactory answer, for by what I heare the Dutch have putt them upon this to hinder our trade; which I really beleive is true, because they have given every Cabushere of any conserne a new cloath besides brandy."
888,2,248,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,30/04/1687,Fort,RAC,"Tis now since the 20 instant, tenn dayes our trade has been stoped, which the country merchants with longing expectations and money in their hands have patiently waited, hoping an accommodation. In the meane time, I hant bene idle with these people here, endeavouring by all the arguments I thought most convenient, and their kind entertainment with what the ffactory affords, to reduce them as formerly.
Upon the reception of yours yesterday I acquainted them of your worships and Councills finall resolution in not allowing any thinge upon soe unresonable demands, and after a longe pallavar, the kings cashe keeper and Mereen being present, thought I had composed the whole affaire, when in the end twas concluded that if I would give them a bendy to drinke all things should be quietly settled, and they would make the country merchants take of those goods that were not as well as those that were vendable. This morning I sent for them againe, and by the assistance of the Mareen and kings cash keeper have made up the pallavar, and the trade is now open and the money coming in as fast as I can take itt, butt they insisted on the same demands as yesterday and I gave them the same answer. The Mereen and other likewise expect a peice for wating here these eight dayes about this buisness; they spoake very well today in the companies behalfe, and told me in privatt that if they some time gave some small dashees among the people, as the Duch doe, wee shold live more quiett without any pallavars if they will play the rogue againe."
889,2,249,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,04/05/1687,Fort,RAC,"Trade coming in againe as formerly occations these lines, desiring you would be pleased to send what blew perpettuanoes, sheets and sayes you can conveniently spare. If the sayes are damnified rate them accordingly, and I can dispose of them, and if there is not the other goods send a baile of narrow nicconees and paper brawles, or what elce you may thinke proper for this place. My accompts and money lies ready to come downe by the Allegattor Sloope, which arived yesterday, and now are getting the things outt, and shall dispatch her downe with corne as soon as possible. If Captain Nuna has don his buissiness, be pleased to send him up againe to looke after the money."
890,2,250,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,07/05/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 14 instant by the 7 hand canoe, with the goods according to invoyce, I have received, and was forced to keepe her a little, the other wanting mending, to help dispatch the Allegator Sloope. By ditto I have sent downe 17m 7o 12a 6ta, which with the 20mk 3o 8a makes 37mk 7o 4a 6ta, being the ballance of laste
months account. I have likewise shiped on board her one hundred thirty six chests of corne, all measured, on boarde, and that their may be noe mistake have sent downe the chest I bought it by, which Mr Whiteings being bigger may occation what was before, or elce the slaves ran away with some of it."
891,2,251,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,13/05/1687,Fort,RAC,"These are to desire you to send one baile of narrow nicconees and Guynea cloutts, twenty boysadoes, tenn barrells of powder, and as many iron barrs besides as the canoe will bringe. Here is plenty of money, and as soone as Captain Gould hath donn wee shall have the trade againe on shoare. Tis now a yeare and halfe and as much as since the 12 of Aprill laste I have been att Commenda, and desire you would be pleased to grant mee an order for sallary, and hope if itt may be allowed as per establishment, you will give that encouragment, considering the trouble and charge I am att and the many dashees I am forced to give away for the advancement of the Royall Affrican Companies intreste bringing the trade to what itt is, or else there is noe peace, quiettness or living amoungst such people as these are."
892,2,252,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,18/05/1687,Fort,RAC,"There being now noe shipping here and a faire prospecte of trade againe, these are to desire you would be pleased to send those goods I writt for in my laste, as soone as the weather will permitt, for itt has been verry extreame here and abundance of raine fallen, butt I don't find itt has done any harme to the building, though it hinders us sometimes from breaking stones, by filling the place with watter, butt that defecte is supplyed by the slaves bringing up those that are broaken. Here has been a flying reporte of a pyratt upon the coaste, with 100 men and 24 guns; and that he has tooke one of the Companies ships, called the St John, which does not any wayes seem credible, though some of the Blacks affirme it still.
When the month is up I shall waitte upon your worshipe and bring downe with mee my money and accompts. I lay out all the wayes that possible I can for corne, butt find it verry scarce, att present."
893,2,253,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,18/05/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 12th instant by the Maynards boat I have received, and likewise tenn chests of sheets and two bailes of blew perpetuanoes, having a supply of tallow by mee and no occasion for cases of spiritts, they being no vendible commodity in this place. I keep a distinct accompt of my sayles and shall bring it to Junes accompt, as you have ordered me, and the mony with me, when I come down with this months accompt, but giving my receipt in this month and not bringing them to accompt till the next I humbly move it to you, fearing hereafter it may occasion some error or mistake, and that you would be pleased to advise me herein by the return of the bearer."
894,2,254,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,28/05/1687,Fort,RAC,"Wee have been according to your order att Aguaffoe with the king, endeavoring to seeke redress for all those continewall abuses that are dayly putt upon us in this place, which affter a greatt deale of trouble, unresonable charges and three dayes waitting wee have there words for att lastte, and thatt for the ffuture there shall never be any body forst [= forced] away without first acquainting your worship and Councell, and the same wass confirmed here yesterday by all the Cabusheers of this place; butt all this, as farr as I understand by there pallavar, is with this proviso, thatt the Royall Company shall pay the kinge two peize per month till the house be build, and when built one bendy per month for ground rent, and to begin this pallavar I was turned away, they nott knowing elce hansomly to bring itt aboutt, for the old fellow mett mee att Aguaffoe, and affter wee had concluded our buisness makes this pallavar anew with the King and Fetteras, and has insensed them soe farr, that I was once afraid the King would not have lett mee come away till they had your answer, butt att laste it was concluded I should goe to Commenda, and from thence thus move itt to your worship and Councell that if you will nott grant the King two peaze per month while the house was building and one bendy per month when built for ground rent, then you are to breake down the house, send for all the Royall Companyes goods and concernes away, and depart their countrey, and there is nobody shall wrong them of the least cracra or abuse us when going off, but if you will grant this we shall be very quiet and peaceable and the king will take us into his protection and endeavour the advancement of the Royall Affrican Companys interest, as he has done allready without any consideration from them by granting the merchants of all countreys a free passage through his and in sending them down with their money to our Factory. You are to chuse (pardon my style for I write after theirs) one of these two which you please and send them an answer immediately, or else to expect and take what follows, for this is the resolution of the king and all of them. We used the best of our endeavour to compose and moderate this affair, but all signifyd nothing for this is a law confirmed like that of the Medes and Persians, for they doe as good as tell us they will have a grant for this or otherwise play the roague. I shall trouble you no further at present, but leave the rest to Hansicoe, who I thinke has faithfully performed the charge you were pleased to commit to him."
895,2,255,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,01/06/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date I received and have followed your instructions, which accordingly proved very successfull, for by sending for Old Tom privately this morning, and telling him the encouragement you were willing to give him, provided for the future he would be faithfull to us, and endeavour to hinder all pallavera's that may be to our prejudice and end this, he was so well satisfied, that the tide is quite changed, and now he stands up as much for us as he was against us, and has wrought so effectually with the kings men that they are satisfied with what you have been pleased to allow him for a ground rent, and don't question but their Master will be the like and not suffer any more abuses to be put upon us, so for the future I hope we shall live more quitely or else we must endeavour to right our selves. I was forced to give the kings men a peoz to drink before I could be rid of them. Old Tom says he will come down a Saturday next and wait upon your worship and Councill, and John Cabess tells me he will come too. Captain Thompson weighed this morning and is gon to windward. Here is corne to be had under 3 angles per chest."
896,2,256,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,10/06/1687,Fort,RAC,"I gott to Comenda last night but had the misfortune to be oversett coming ashore and have lost most of my things and the mony that I brought up with me, which was taking from me when I was in the water either by the canoemen or some that came pretendedly to my assistance. All the Royall Companyes concernes here are safe and secure, and the goods ashore you was pleased to order me, and dont question but I shall have a very good trade again.
[PS] By the return of the canoe I have sent down one woman slave and a girle that are sick and uncapable of any work."
897,2,257,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,15/06/1687,Fort,RAC,"This serves chiefly for a cover to the inclosed, being two coppyes of the last months accompt. I have almost finished another, but being hindred by business otherwayes shall lett it alone till next conveyance. Edward Jackline and Nathaniell Westrane have been both very bad with an ague and feavor, butt today are a little better and hope will recover if the next fitt don't pull them downe againe. Wee have had abundance of rain and badd weather, but don't find that it does prejudice the building, though it hinders our slaves from breaking stones, and the overflowing of the river has carried so great a bank of sand into the sea that the landing place is become very dangerous."
898,2,258,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,23/06/1687,Fort,RAC,"On Tuesday night the Allegator Sloop from Succondee came here to an anchor, having two hundred iron barrs to putt ashore, but waiting all yesterday and now likewise the sea running extraordinary high, so there is no possibility of getting the goods ashore or likely to be better weather, I thought it more proper to advise his coming down, knowing not whither his absence with the corn may hinder Captain Goulds dispatches. I have occasion for tenn chests sheets, two cases sayes, two bales of narrow niconees and one bale of paper brails, which with the iron barrs be pleased to send by the Sloop if you do not otherwise di[s]pose of her and Mr Chambers to foreward the building, for the Dutch are hard at it, thinking to have done before us."
899,2,259,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,02/07/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date last night I received, and according to order have sent down Fozea Doe and Bashaw the Royall Companys slaves. Wee are breaking stones as fast as wee can, and others employ'd in bringing them up, and for scaffolding poles I will send again to the King or endeavour to gett them elswhere. Upon Captain Daniells coming downe I went on board to know whether you had any advise of his arrivall, and he told me Mr Bucknell was on board and said he was send down, which made me think it needlesse, so hope you will please to excuse me, but for the future shall send on board all ships and immediately advise. Here lyes three or four Dutch interlopers up and downe, who have been a very great hinderance to the ffactory, but I hear they have now disposed of all so that I hope to have a good trade next weeke. I have sent downe another Mayes accompt and my accompts of last. The mony will send per Mr Pepperell, he is gott as high as Ampenney."
900,2,260,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,04/07/1687,Fort,RAC,"By the Alligator sloop I received eight chests containing five hundred and twenty sheetes, two bales containing two hundred and forty narrow nicconees. one baile containing two hundred and forty paper brawles and two hundred iron barrs, all which I hope will come to a good markett. I sent of yesterday to a vessell coming down, which proved to be a Dutch Companys ship from the Beneen, and had been out three months and [said] that the Jacob Pink came out before them a month and had lost two men. They saw no shipping to windward more than a Dutch interloper and one of their Companyes ships. By Mr Pepperell I have sent the ballance of last months accompt."
901,2,261,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,05/07/1687,Fort,RAC,"The occasion of my writing is to acquaint you that it is now dancing time at Aguaffo and the King hath sent down people to demand his custome according to Articles of Agreement made between him and the Worshipfull Henry Nurse Esq, late Agent Generall for the Royall Affrican Company of England, of December 1686, vizt two anchors brandy and one say to be paid himselfe, one ankor of brandy to the Fettera, one cloth or gingham to the Queen, two angles in gold to the Chief Cappusheers of this place, two fine sletias and half an anchor of brandy to the merchants, and half a barrell of powder and half an ankor of brandy to the soldiers. I have few of those things by me as per my accompt, so have sent this canoe for what you are pleased to order, the Kings men being in great hast to begone again. I understand he expected to be paid his custome without sending for it, wee hearing that twas now their dancing time. I have occasion for 10 boysadoes, which if the canoe will bring be pleased to send per her return.
[PS] Pray be pleased to dispatch the canoe as soon as possible, and send the things by her with your order for their delivery."
902,2,262,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,16/07/1687,Fort,RAC,"Having had an indifferent good trade, these are to desire you to send me 20 boysadoes, 2 bales of blew perpetuanoes, two bales of narrow niconees, fforty half ffirkins of tallow and tenn barrells of powder in wholes and halves. Pray be pleased so to order them away that they may be hear on Tuesday morning; The King was well satisfyed when I sent him his custome, and say's as soon as Mr Chambers comes up lett him send to him, and he will send a hundred men which he beleives will cutt as many scaffolding poles in one day as wee shall have occasion for. They must come this way for them, there being none to be gott nigher than Shuma. Wee have been all of us here taken with agues and feavors and great pains in our limbs since the ffoggy weather came in, but I hope twill wear away again. Here just now came down a Dutch Companyes ship and I sent John Ratcliff to enquire what newes to windward, and the Captain told him they saw no shipp &ca, but since came to our house the Copeman of Shuma with the Chief here and they tell me that the Mary is to windward and that they had it from the Captains own mouth, so he told them one thing and us another"

I will send to the King again for the men he promised to cutt the scaffolding poles, but I understand he wants Mr Chambers here first, and the bricklayers to forward the worke, and seemes concerned that the Dutch are so far before us. Here are a good quantity of stones broken, and most of them brought up round the building. That which will be chiefly wanting is lime.
Yesterday morning one of our slaves went to cutt some wood, and coming through the corn with it, chanced to break down a stalk with three ears upon it, whereupon they panniard him for stealing their corn and kept him in irons, demanding one saye and half a barrell of powder for his redemption. I sent twice for him yesterday but they would not lett him come, but today have sent to the King and suppose shall gett him again with some small charge."
904,2,264,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,25/07/1687,Fort,RAC,"These are to desire you to send me fifty half ffirkins of tallow, one bale of paper brails, twelve barrells of powder and one bale of black bafts broad, and if there are perpetuanoes or pewter basons be pleased to send me some with the other goods, and order them away so that they may here tomorrow morning if possible. I have occasion for my bulce and a gold chest for the better security of the mony in sending it down. I have gott the slave again I write you was panniard for stealing of corn, but it cost me four angles and about three gallons of brandy. I sent again to the King about the scaffolding poles and he promises to gett some, as he has done a great while, but I see none coming and believe we must send to Shuma at last to gett some."
905,2,265,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,27/07/1687,Fort,RAC,"Both yours of yesterdayes date I have received and the goods by 17 hand canoe accordingly, vizt two hundred and forty paper brawles, one hundred broad black bafts, twenty five blew perpetuanoes, fifty half ffirkins of tallow, one hundred two pound pewter basins, and twelve whole barrells of powder. By the return of this canoe I have sent down in the gold chest twenty four markes of gold. What I take more before the month is up you shall have with my accompts per the next conveyance."
906,2,266,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,28/07/1687,Fort,RAC,"I provided all things ready to have dispatched the canoe away again yesterday but the canoe men going into the town, these people and they fell out and they have gott broken heads on both sides. This morning by calling all the merchants and Cappusheers together, I have made them friends and composed the pallavera for the future. Henry Clement can satisfye you farther. I had a good trade yesterday and have sent down eight markes more in a leathern bulce, which with the 24 in the other makes in all thirty two markes of gold. Pray be pleased to lett me have receipts."
907,2,267,William Cross,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,30/07/1687,Fort,RAC,"Be pleased to understand that the people are making a pallavera to turn me out, because I will not trust them with the Companys goods, and so ruin and discredit my self. They have another article against me too for selling the iron barrs too dear, for where I give but 24 they can go to the Dutch ffactory and have 28 per bendy, and that I am too curious in blowing and picking their mony, and such like frivolous storyes. Tis only by the intercession of Old Pay and Captain Peter, two of the Chief Merchants, that I am not turned out before I could give you this accompt, for they are resolved to have another, which if you approve dispose with me otherwayes, as you are pleased to order, and I shall most readily obey. John Ratcliffe being very sick and weake, upon his request I have sent him down.
[PS] Here will be wanting another man in John Ratcliffs room. I have paid him his sallary."
908,2,268,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,06/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"Last night between 7 and 8 of the clock I arrived here and this morning had all the Cappusheers with me, from whom I received a very kind welcome. I did not call in at the Mina, but since understand that the ship that came down two dayes since was an interloper taken to windward and sent downe. Likewise that the Generalls journy to the King was purposely to remove the Ffrench men, which was not granted. Great dashees was given on that intent, but not having his desire answerable to his expectacons, went away much discontented. Its reported that to windward are arrived three Ffrench ships.
Traders are not as yett returned, tarrying here on expectacon of goods, which are one hundred half ffirkins tallow, two bales of black bafts, one bale of broad niconees, and two ditto of narrow ditto, one bale of paper brails, twelve barrells of powder, two hundred two pound pewter basons. What sheetes and perpetuanoes you can spare, may be immediately disposed of. It is also desired by the Cappusheers that Mr Chambers be sent up with what assistance can be spared to forward the building, the Dutch being much beforehand with us, This morning came Nunah, and according to your orders menconed the removall of Mr Crosse, but [they] would give me no answer, only that he may come without any molestacon to receive what belongs to him."
909,2,269,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,12/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 8th and 9th instant have received, and according to your order endeavoured as much the resetling Mr Cross as I could doe, butt the Cabusheers as I writte you before, soe now likwise would give mee noe answer, butt that he deliver the Factory up and take his things away with him. Could scarce gett soe much time from them, as to lett him tarry till the greatt canoe came up. Cannot understand Mr Cross has anywayes disoblidged them; butt as alwayes they have been rouges, soe I feare they will remayne. Not finding any probability of resetling Mr Cross, have taken into my possession all the Royall Affrican Companyes merchandize and matterialls belonging to this Factory, as per invoyce does apear, for which I shall be accomptable for. As to relating the Generalls goeing to Aguaffoe, cannot understand it to be on any other accompt then what I writt you; if otherwise shall advise."
910,2,270,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,12/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 10 instant have received, with two hundred and thirty narrow nicconees, two hundred blacke baffts, two hundred and forty paper brawles, two hundred two pound pewter basons, twenty whole firkins tallow, and thirty halfe, on acompt Royall Affrican Company of England. Desiare you will send two hundred more blacke baffts, and twelve barrells powder. The fine narrow nicconees, which Mr Cross informes mee has been here some time, and will not sell att the price ordered, if you thinke convenient to sell them at 2a 6ta each, desiare your order, which I believe may be better then to remaine unsould, wee being much troubled with rattes, they may be damnified. Desire you will send some brandy and rume for the Factory, here not being any, and trade cannot be carryed on withoutt those supplyes. Since my writing my former understand the Generall[s] journy to Aguaffoe was on accompt of a pawne of his, the king of Accraas sonn, who with others went up with goods to one Tagee, a rebell, and they all being panniard by the king of Aguaffoe, itt happened that the said kings sonn of Accraa had his head cutt off, and all there goods taken away. Soe the Generall demanded sattisfaction, but not being granted, retturned the same night in greatt anger. This is more I heare off. Mr Chambers presents his service to you, and desires the seaven hand canoe may be sent backe in all hast for to fetch greatt stone, and that she brings up in her what lime shee cann."
911,2,271,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,13/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"This serves only to desire you to send up six trowells and six hammers, which Mr Chambers advised mee to send for, being for the use of the building. He likwise desires you would send by the first opertunity what lime you possible can, imagining by Wednesday all the stocke here may be spent. The 7 hand canoe I mentioned in my last came not downe to you, the canoemen being unwilling to carry her, soe desire you will give order to them when opertunity serves that she may be mended and made for use, which shall have occasion to imploy her in 
stones, here not being any great stones, and at present have much want of them."
912,2,272,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,14/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 13th instant have received, with one hundred and fifty broade blacke baftes, tenn whole barrells of powder, and one hundred and sixty mundee Binin cloaths, and two ankers of brandy. Here is noe corne to be procured att present, butt hope by the first opertunity to supply you with tenn or twenty chests, butt must buy itt by the taccoees, which will be about two angles or more perr cheste. They are unwilling to give any more than a bendy for thirty four mundees, and soe att that ratte they will buy a considerable quantity, soe if you please to sell them soe, you may send two or three hundred more. Desire you will send one baile more of paper brawles; likwise an answer concerning the fine nicconees, the merchants being willing to buy them all. One of the baggs of mundees contains butt thirty nine, the rest all forty, soe there is one wanting to make up the full complement."
913,2,273,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,15/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"These are to desire you to send twenty good boysadoes, fifty halfe firkins tallow, with the goods I write for yesterday, and that they may be here tomorrow; being the day traders will be here. Mr Chambers desires you will spare him all the boards you can for scaffaling, and what ould timber you can for to putt in the wall, the brickes being safft.
[PS] Mr Chambers desires a carpinter."
914,2,274,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,21/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 19th instant have received with two hundred and forty paper brawles, four hundred Benin mundee cloths, and forty seaven gallons rumme. Am sorry cannot be supplyed with boysadoes, knives, and Guinea stuffs. Provided you have any boysadoes (although damnified), desire you would send ten, with the iron I wrote for. Mr Chambers desires the sloop may be dispatcht in all haste with lyme, the last being but a small quantity, and soon workt up; have returned the cask. Per this canoe you will receive ten chests of new corne."
915,2,275,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,23/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"This comes by the returne of the 9 hand canoe, in whom have sent you downe eight chests of new corne. Desire you would send me some iron barrs, and if you have any damnified boysadoes could dispose of them. Have but little trade this eight last days, and not having goods proper cannot expect any. Mr Chambers desires you would send in all halfe the lyme; he is now gon in the country to gett scaffolding poles. No news to windward."
916,2,276,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,25/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"This comes by Mr Chambers, who comes downe on account of some necessarys he shall have occasion for the building. He will informe you concerning the scaffold. The other day he went in the country purposely to procure, but att his retturne the kings Mareen demanded for their people bringing of them downe, two ounces and a halfe anckor of brandy, butt provided they would bring downe one hundred and twenty long and shortt and that may be fitting for our purpose in tenn dayes, they should have six peaze and halfe an anckor of rum, which they consented to, and one [= on] that intent the Mareen will this night goe to the king to gett his people. The King likwise demands his monthly sallary att eight angles per month, which he sayes was never paid him in Mr Cros's time. I told him I know nothing off itt butt would informe you, and soe desire your answer concerning it. Mr Cross would doe verry well to send mee an accompt of all customes and there time when to be
given, that therein I may not be to seeke when they demand it. I desire you would admitt of Mr Griffith's coming up here that he may give mee an accompt of all things att Agga, with the inventory delivered from whome shall goe there, that thereby I may discharge myselfe of that place, and then will send you those accounts, determining the time I received this Factory."
917,2,277,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,01/01/1000,Fort,RAC,"These are sent on purpose to desire you to send Mr Chambers up, if with conveniency he can returne, for the people here are impatient till such time our ffort be don. The Dutch have finished their house but are still fetching stones, on what designe I know not. Yesterday the king sent to them, and told them since they had don their house, they should desist fetching any more stones, for he knew not whether the consequence might not be of great inconveniency. They tell me in ten days shall have what scaffolding poles wee want, and will be for their parts as assisting to us in building the fortification as possible they can. The like I told them would not be wanting in ours. But litle trade this ten days, being hindred by some pallaveraes occasioned in the country, that they have not yett disposed of any goods already bought. Yours off the 23 instant by the Alligator Sloop have received, who arrived here last night, so as yett have not taken out the iron barrs, nor lyme. Shall take care what wee can to returne the casks with the heads of them. Observe your orders in disposeing off the damnified goods for corne, at la 6 per chest, but yours of the 13 instant being so urging [= urgent] for corne and I not knowing what occasion you might have for it, caused me to procure you six chests after the rate of 2a per chest, and beleive cannot gett any more under that price. Last night went downe a small Portuguez. Pray informe me whether you please to have the corne sent downe in the sloop."
918,2,278,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,30/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"This comes by a canoe bound downe to Cabo Corso and is to desire you to send twenty whole firkins of tallow.

The reason of his tarrying here to windward is that he expects two great shipps from France of fifty guns each, which were to come out in a litle time after him. He toucht in at all the places to windward, was ashore at Gambia, and Cherelone, likewise here on the Coast at Axim and the Brandenburghs. He designs, as he told me, to come downe to Cabo Corso in three or four days. Also the reason that he tooke the Dutch interloper was that he found French colours on board him, and severall writings, wherein was the whole concerne of the shipp, all in Ffrench. He put the comander of her ashore at the Brandenburghs, and gave him all his goods and gold. The Commander of this French man hath been severall times on this Coast, he gives a good description of Agent Greenhill, also of severall places both to windward and leward. He lyes here to dispose off a considerable quantity of Portuguez tobacco, at 9 lb per angle, brandy at la 4ta per gallon, so that he sells none.

The French flagg flyes at Ampenna, and as the Negroes report will likewise ffly upon the Dutch flagg staff here. The certainty of it shall be better informed per returne of Hansecoe.

Likewise Kufroo will be assisting to the Adooms, who [= Kufroo] are very popalus and rish but are hindred to trade. The issue of it wee shall in a short time understand. The French are building now a mud house, but have contracted with
the King of Aguaffo to build a strong fort in a yeares time, which if not are to demand no right or title to settle there, soe that I imagine they have given the King (and as I am informed) thirty marke."

Relateing to the warrs between Cufferoes and Ambramboes, the first attempted yesterday on the latter, which caused them to fly to Aguaffo but returned the same night with a greate force, soe that the Cufferoes left them. The Fettues had yesterday a small fight with the Cufferoes, its thought they will not come to a sett fight. The difference between the Cufferoes and Ambramboes were almost decided had not the Generall of the Mina encouraged them [ = the Cufferoes] to proceed in their intend with [ms 'wch'] the Ambramboes [and] promised them all the assistance he can to fight Aguaffo, without they will remove the French, which is expected every day will be, and that the Generall will make up all pallavers. The King of Aguaffo must be forst to remove them, or will endanger his whole country, which in a day or two shall understand, and you shall have further advice. Shall be carefull of all concernes here. Here are severall comodityes here that are damnified and not fitting for this place, which I will put on board the sloope at her arrivall, soe that if any danger happens can the sooner put aboard the remaines. As to the damaged goods if you thinke conveinent shall remaine them aboard the sloope and send them downe after that the pallavers are all over. On the arrivall likewise of Captain Batherne shall put aboard what corne I have without contrary orders from you. He is expected down this day, having been at Succonde this five dayes.

The corne I had designed to had put on board Captain Batherne, who promised last night to send his long boate for it, but is this morning turnd to windward. John Cabess and Cabushiers have sent all their effects from hence, tho I hope all pallavers will be decided, for Taggee, who is now with Abonadoe, its thought will returne to his owne croome, which done the differences will be soone over. This Tagge is all one as Ahen at Annamaboe, who [= Tagge] relying on the Cufferoes and Abonadoe was in hopes to conquer Aguaffo. Mr Griffith being very ill comes downe."

The Fetera, who in all this pallaver has been much for the Dutch, is now of the contrary, insoemuch as I question whether they may have a settling here more. The King of Aguaffo has proffered the Dutch house to the French, which they denied.
You have [heard] that the French Factory was sett on ffire by a Dutch slave. As to relating to the warrs, I understand the King is in the ffeild with all his army, but have as yett made noe ffight. The Cufferoes and Umbramboes [sic: = Abramboes] have made severall attempts, in which was a greate many killed on both sides. Have received severall messengers from the King to advise me to send of all my goods aboard, which accordingly I have done, only three barrells and a halfe of powder.

Here is also fifty or sixty small canooes who will not suffer any canoe to goe of, and this morning had not Mr Bayly gott aboard the Dutch shipp he had by those canoes been cutt to peeces before he had gott aboard his sloope. After the returne of the canoes to the Mina, who are tomorrow expected againe, Mr Bayly went aboard the shipp, and examined the full reason of the Blacks attempt, who told him that he could not hinder what they had done, or may doe. Mr Bayly being in greate want of water, I desire you would order some meanes how he may send ashoare, and that I may have a free passage in case of any disturbance to send aboard the sloope."
962,2,322,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,11/02/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 10th instant have received and returne you thanks for your kindness. I hope the pallaver will soon be decided, understanding it tis the King of Aguaffos inclination to remove the French, who [i.e. the king] on that intent sent for the Cheife yesterday to come up to him, but being sick he did not. Its thought he will have him up with him, that he may the better make up the difference with the Generall of the Mina. The shipp continues here yett and fires every day six or seven great gunns over the towne, and will not suffer any canoe to goe off without a white man in it. Upon sending the powder aboard one of the barrells hoopes was all broake, so have ordered Mr Bayly to make use of it as he finds occasion, or to deliver it ashoare at Cabo Corso Castle. Herewith you will receive my January accounts, the gold is on board the Sloope."
963,2,323,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,17/02/1688,Fort,RAC,"Not having heard lately from Cabo Corso Castle, this is onely to be informed where [= whether] you please as yett to have the goods be brought ashoare, not understanding of any pallaver here at Comenda, in which you are better advised then I can be, for I have noe body to informe me. Have had some time since advice of Noonas coming up, who probably may be expected to be here, but as yett is not come, soe desire you would hast him, that therein I may the better informe you of all transactions, which at present I cannot, John Cabess not coming near me. Yesterday passed by the Alligator Sloope. Captain Buttram I heare is at Taccaradoe but designes to windward."
964,2,324,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,19/02/1688,Fort,RAC,"This is to advise you that yesterday the French were removed from hence, but their goods detaind by the Negroes. Its likewise reported that tomorrow the Generall of the Mina will send a Factor here, the King of Aguaffo having given him sufficient pawn for their security, and the Generall to gratifie him, hath given him two hundred and fifty bendyes in good gold. This information I have from John Cabess and Cabushiers. You formerly promised me a flagg, I desire you would send it. The French shipp who is now gon downe, informed us of two English shipps, the one a friggott, the other a pink, at Cape Lahoo."
965,2,325,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,24/02/1688,Fort,RAC,"This is only to advise you that yesterday Mr Griffith was taken with a convulsion fitt, which lasted him severall houres, and remains in so bad a condition, that dare not send him downe, so I desire, if you can give him any releif, you would be pleased to disptach it in all hast. Captain Buttram I hear is gon up to Ashinee."
966,2,326,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,11/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"This evening the King sent down to me, to lend him seaven barrels of powder, and in case I had none, to send to you, so thought more convenient to deny him, and referr it to your selves, likewise I have not that quantity, which if I had I could not doe without your order, which I advised him, also telling him that he had been supplyed already from Cabo Corso. It is reported here that the Bendefoes have encountered the Cuferas this day."
967,2,327,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,12/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"This is to advise you of the arrivall of Captain Barrott, who this evening came to an anchor here. The bearer hereof being indisposed, and desired leave to come downe. There is another English shipp at Dickiscove."
968,2,328,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,14/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 13th instant have received, with ten barrels of powder. Observe your orders for the intrusting the King of Aguaffo with five of them, shall endeavour to get what security I can for them, and to dispose of the rest, according to your order. By Mr Ronan you will receive my February accompts with its ballance, two ounces, eleaven angles. Have not more to enlarge, referring all windward news to Mr Ronan, who comes with the same conveyance."
969,2,329,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,21/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"Having this conveniency by a Cabo Corso canoe, it is to advise you that Mr Bayly, who by reason of bad weather has broke two cables, and besides his pump very bad, which if should given way, [he] must come downe, and so thought convenient to informe you of it beforehand. Three or four days since the King of Aguaffo sent a pawne for ten barrels of powder, but it not being all good gold, I spared him but four barrells, till such time he brought another that is good, which he promised to do, and to receive the powder at 1oz 4a per barrell. Am advised of three French men of warr to windward, and that they have taken a Dutch Companys shipp. Hear nothing of Captain Lomax nor Captain Bridges, only that the French shipp some time since gon downe spoke with the latter in the road of Sestos."
970,2,330,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,24/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"Inclosed is a letter from Mr Blinsham, which came just now to hand. Provitions being very scarce, I desire you would be so kind as to spare me a litle beefe, for I cannot get ffish nor fowles for money nor any thing elce without paying double the price. It would be very convenient to have the slaves returne here for a litle time, to provide thatch and wood to cover the Fort, for what people I have neither know how to do it, and besides are too few. It has been formerly thatcht, but Mr Chambers knows its all broke to peeces, and lost, expecting it might be finisht this season, so did not take any care of preserving the thatch. This comes by a canoe, not on purpose but bound downe on his owne account."
971,2,331,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,31/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"According to your order have put aboard the Ann sloop, all the merchandizes and materialls belonging to the Factory of Comenda, which were before aboard the Adventure sloop. He being ordered up with the Alligator to Succondee, are now both on their voyage. Captain Lomax is here, and by his owne discourse, designes to remayne eight days. No trade stirring, and but little news concerning the warrs. The King of Aguaffo has ordered the French flagg to fly on the Dutch flagg staff, which accordingly does. By this canoe you will receive one of the working slaves, who instead of working for the factory, makes it his buisness to fetch wood for the towne, so desire another in his place. By the next shall send my accompts."
972,2,332,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,06/04/1688,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys my March accompt with its ballaance, five angles and five taccoes. Captain Bridges is in the roade I suppose, but the seas being so bad, there has not been a canoe on board him, neither any from him a shoare. Have made the eight barrels powder, which are delivered the King upon pawns, remayning till such time he redeems them, and then will give the company credit for them. Here is not any trade stirring, neither can I understand any discourse of their proceedings against the Cufferaes. Abonadoe I heare is very ill with severall paines in his bones occasioned by his debauchary. Have write you some time since concerning sending the slaves here to provide wood and thatch for the covering of the building, the sooner you could sent them the better, for wee have had a great deale of raine already and no question but may have much more, which must needs be prejudiciall."
973,2,333,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,17/04/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday the King and Fetera sent downe to me for powder, but not having any I gave them a letter to you, which was stopt by the Mina canoemen, and returned hither, so this day I send away my owne five hand canoe, and desire you would be pleased to send up ten barrels of powder. The Fetera sends downe two men to remayne as pawns, which if you please to lett them remayne with you, I can deliver them two of them you sent up to me. I desire you would dispatch the canoe this night.
[PS] I send my flag in the canoe, that the Mina may not molest her, as she passed."
974,2,334,Robert Elwes,Komenda,,Cape Coast Castle,18/04/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours have received, and shall according as I see occasion receive what powder you order Captain Bridges to deliver me. You have heard that the Great Fatera is defeated, and by its means it is thought Aguaffo will be worsted, though as yet wee have no ill news from the King, but that he has fought stoutly. It is reported the Litle Fatera has routed the Cuferas. The enemies have taken and burnt all the upper croomes, but as yet have not attempted our parts here. Ampenny is all burnt by the Mina people. The Great Fatera is now aboard Captain Bridges, with as many more Blacks as she can conveniently receive, likewise the sloop full. I have secured the Royall Affrican Companys concernes, the brandy excepted, which is ashore, and cannot get people to bring it off, for as I send the great canoe ashore, the natives force themselves into her, and come off.
[PS] This accompanies the Great Fatera."
975,2,335,Ralph Hassell,Fredericksburg,,Cape Coast Castle,05/09/1687,Fort,RAC,"Here is a man that would have two bendys worth of three pound pewter basons. I told him here was none, and not soe many at Caboe Corsoe. Whatt there is that is good, pray spare, with some lead barrs if any.

The warehouse has naer a dore, nor conveniences to lay goods upon, therefore be pleased to dispatch us necessaryes as soone as possible. Here are severall Arcany men who have brought good sumes in gold, and doe want particularly sheets, iron barrs, lead barrs, powder, carabines, pewter of all sorts, paper brawles, tallow, says, rum, boysadoes, &ca, of each sort of which you may be pleased to send us a quantity. I wont neglect to put the Factory into an imeadiate capacity of receiving all things necessary, therefore be pleased to dispatch us a carpenter to assist us in our wants. Pray send us some pewter juggs, for the people doe aske for them. You may also send other goods which you may thinke conveinent. This is what at present I can informe you, but hope to make new discoveries and shall advise you."
994,2,354,John Bloome,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,22/12/1687,Fort,RAC,"I wrote you the 19th instant, a little after my arrivall, I then lett you know the greate occasion wee should have for a carpenter to make doores, windowes, &ca, but for thatching and mending of our walls, wee are working with all dilligence. The Arcanee men are gone up to the country but doe promise to be downe againe very speedily. I wish wee had some of their mony before their departure. I hope to have a good trade when goods come."

996,2,356,John Bloome,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,03/01/1688,Fort,RAC,"My last was per the Frances boate, since which have none from you. The Blacks are impatient to see goods come, and begin to be discontent, and say that the English dont intend to settle the Factory, therefore if the French do come they say they shall be very welcome. This Captain Coffee tells me, which I thought not amiss to advise you. Here are some Arcanyes in towne have brought mony, but if our goods dont come today they'l be begon to Morea, but I hope before night wee shall have wherewithall to satisfie them. I have gott the Captain of the Arcanies to perswade them to stay till to morrow night, upon full assurance of goods for their purpose."

Having this oppertunity and it coming into my mind, I thought fitt to desire you would be pleased to speake to Captain Cowley for his weights and scales &ca. If I could have bought any, I would not have put you to this trouble, for which I beg your pardon. The Blacks are something better satisfied then they were the other day, and altho the goods they most desire are not yett come, I have againe obliged them to stay, but with much adoe. I am expecting another canoe."

According to your order I shall purchase two hundred chest of corne, and shall take all care possible to preserve it from the wevell. I thanke you humbly for sending me a man that may be soe necessary to me. Your letter for Mr Nightingale I sent away on arrivall. I hope you have Captain Cowleys weights &ca, but suppose you have forgott to send them by this canoe. The Cabushiers of this place came this morning for their custome (as they call it), which they say is one ankor of rum and one say. I desire you would be pleased to give me your resolution in this matter. Mr Nightingale may know some thing of itt, therefore have writt to him to be informed. I have received 12 cases of spirritts, but you mention but ten in the letter."
1002,2,362,John Bloome,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,14/01/1688,Fort,RAC,"I write to you yesterday per the canoe that brought some goods, to which referr you. Mr Nightingale writes me that he knowes not the custome that the Cabushiers used to be allowed, therefore I referr myselfe to you. This goes per Herbert Currie, who was sent hither by Mr Nightingale."
1003,2,363,John Bloome,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,10/02/1688,Fort,RAC,"Our Cabushiers are not content with 3 cases of spirritts, they would perswade me to beleeve that they were allowed two Welch plaines in Mr Prices time, and desire to have the value of an ounce in some other goods. Therefore when you please to order it shall be observed by [JB]."
1004,2,364,John Bloome,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,20/02/1688,Fort,RAC,"Captain Batherne told me that he would leave his weights, scales &ca with you, therefore this is to desire you would be pleased to remember him of his promise.

1010,2,370,John Bloome,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,16/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"Just now I have received yours and accordingly have dispatched the canoe to Captain Buttram. The news wee have here informes me that the biggest of the two
is a French man, the other a Portuguez, but I shall endeavor to informe my selfe better, and if I discover any thing shall advise you and Captain Buttram."
1011,2,371,John Bloome,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,17/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday I sent a canoe off to the French man to discover what he might be, but they would not suffer the Blacks to go aboard, not upon offer to trade with them. This morning I sent againe, and the Blacks had admittance, but not to come nigh the cabin door, which was guarded with two musquittes, a thing not usuall on board honest merchant men, nor will they sell any goods for gold, but offer to barter for slaves. Those circumstances do perswade me that he is a rogue, and I have given Captain Buttram notice of it, by returne of the message. I understand that you have sent 20 men to his assistance, which I am glad off, for he cannot be too secure. If you please to give me any instructions they shall be duly observed."
1012,2,372,John Bloome,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,18/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"I have received yours of this instant. The French man is sayld too leward, and I hope will not trouble any of the Royall Companyes shipps. If you please to send me some powder, here are traders will buy it out of hand."
1013,2,373,William Ronan,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,05/04/1688,Fort,RAC,"I have according to your orders sent Mr Whiting a copy of the inclosed. Captain Barratt parted yesterday. Annamaboe inventory is signed, noe ballance due to the Company by the accompt finished before the warehouse was opened, but by his other accompts he sayes there will, theye are not made up as yett. Ther's noe corne at all but is dayly in expectation, as I suppose he writt you. Agga inventory and Annishan likewise have done, there accompts are not as yett made up. By tomorrow night, I judge I may be re'dy to waite on you at Cabo Corsoe. I shall give you a farther accompt at [sic] of my proceedings on my arrivall."

Be pleased to send me some powder, Guinea clouts, sheets, fifty iron barrs, all which are in request, and a few allejarrs,
for a tryall. Corne is scarce, what intrigue the Blacks have to keep it is a mistery to me. I hope you have got weights and scales, &ca, of which I have great occasion."
1015,2,375,John Bloome,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,09/04/1688,Fort,RAC,"I have received yours of this instant, per the 9 hand canoe, per whom have received fifty iron barrs, two hundred and sixty sheets, and twenty five allejarrs, on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England. If I find an occasion to barter powder for 16 chests of corne, shall advise you, but hitherto the Arcanies have generally demanded it. The Corrantier presseth for a say, he has sent here dozen times, but I am resolved to do nothing without your order.

Their good success in their rogeries has brought them to such a hight that they esteem and vallue a white man as nought, and as for the Castle, they say can distroy it at pleasure. Likewise say no man shall live their as Cheife but whome they approve off. Hope will not impute it ill in giveing Mr Nightingale whome you orderd my Cheife, an answer of his letter. Shall as a servant to the Royall Company study to discharge my duty in all respects. The Capushers as yett are indifferently civill. The Curranteers dayly dun me for their custome, saying that what Mr Nightingale gave them was as a dashee and not as their custome. Shall treat the Capushers to the utmost of my abillity, which is to give them ffaire language, and more am not capible of."
1094,2,454,James Walker,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,10/10/1686,Fort,RAC,"Am just now privately informd per Comander James that the Braffo and Curranteers intend tomorrow to shut up the gate, the reason know not, they this morning seeming to be very kind, only was very desireous of knowing who should be their Coopeman, which told them know not, but did beleive in two or three days time there would be one according to your pleasures, this is what passed between them and selfe, parting very civilly. Leave it to your construction."
1095,2,455,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,14/10/1686,Fort,RAC,"These accompany's Mr Samuell Humfryes, who will give you a true narrative of all our proceedings, since our arrivall here; and that the lowest these people would come down to which is agreed on to pay them, vizt to the Capushers of Annamaboe two sayes and one anchor of rum, to the Braffo and Quarrenterrs the same. To write att large would be to prolix, therefore beg your excuse and leave it to the narration of Mr Humfryes, who also imports the inventory's of both factory's with their last months accounts, also what mony Mr Perrin had received. The Arcanyes this morning came here and demanded affter some small debate, one say and a case of spirritts, which they say was always allow'd them, soe would intreat the ffavour to enquire of Mr Nightingale what he gave, that I may not exceed in any think [= thing], and what your Worship will allow, for more Ile not pay on the Company account at present. Will not overtyre your patience with an over large epistle, by reason of Mr Humfryes speed, but will enlarge as opertunity occasion's. If have omitted anything, pray lett me be advis'd in what, which will endeavour to supply the defect."
1096,2,456,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,18/10/1686,Fort,RAC,"My long silence was for want of subjects, soe begg it may not be imputed neglect. Since my being here, which is a week today, have taken noe more mony then one ounce, which was for iron barrs. Nothing of trade presents by reason the Arcanyes are gon up, but in few dayes they will return. The comodity I want at present is rum, which I begg may be supplyd with. Heare is never a cano belonging to the ffactory, which upon occasion will be much wantd. I have had many fair promises but as yett noe performance of a trade. The men here has not been paid for the last two months due the 8th instant, and all the mony here will not be suficient, being in all, with Mr Walkers takeing in Mr Nightingales absence, 7oz 7a 8ta; but as soon as have enough will pay them. I am anxious in mind that I cannot give my Masters noe better encouragement, but time that brings all things to pass, I hope will alter the currant.
[PS] Since what is writte above have received your orders which shall be obeyd."
1097,2,457,James Walker,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,22/10/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yours by the 17 hand cano with 3 casks of rum have received, and have returnd per her what goods of Mr Nightingales she is capable of carrying; and shall returne the[m] when ordered. Shall be very carefull in all the Company affairs."
1098,2,458,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,25/10/1686,Fort,RAC,"This morning I haveing takeing mony for stript sattins but have none, soe request I may have some sent as soon as possible, and by the return of the canoe will send up two good men and two women slaves. Asheddow being a verry dilligent ffellow and one who hath the ear of all the Arcanyes and as far as I perceive rules them here, he by Affidoe or some other means understands that your worship is not well affected to Affidoe, which indeed there is no reason of affection towards him; and in fine Ashadoe would nay can officiate the place of a linguister better than Captain Dickall Affidoe; soe desired me to write to you that he may have the sallery he had, and promises to bring all the traders here; I request your answer. Here is a great quantity of mony, but for those goods which I know is not at Cape Coast, so shall not nominate them. All things are quiett and in a good composed estate here, which I will endeavour to keep soe, for the benifitt of my imployers. Had any thing of moment presentd would have advised, and shall as occasion offers. Have sent up 7 bolts, 1 piece long irons to be mended, also two cold chisells. Have not another here, which begg I may be supplyed with."
1099,2,459,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,29/10/1686,Fort,RAC,"These I send on purpose, being much importunated by the Arcanyes for two or three hundred of brass neptunes, not of the largest size, those from one pound and a halfe to two pound. I sold just now all that I had, being 146 which has layne by here for some months, all at 6ta per pound, and have received 7oz 8a for two hundred and forty pounds. I fear the stilliards are naught; I request the weight of them, to know whether I am wronged, and the next parcell will retrive the loss if [so]. Here is mony some quantitty, but for perpetuanoes blew, sheets and such goods I know there is none at Cabo Corso. I beg that the neptunes may be here by tomorrow at noone.
On Munday God willing I purpose to send up Mr Walker with this months account and the ballance, with the slaves advised in my former."
1100,2,460,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,01/11/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 30th ultimo I have received, togather with 369 brass panns. There wanted two of what you writt should bee; and are not of the sorte the last was, which they doe not like by reason they are bright within and turnd in streaks on the outside, and are to weighty. I have sent a sample of the sort and size they would buy; if they be a verry little size bigger and lesser, it matters not much. They tell me they have two marks for such when your Worship pleases to send the cano with such. If there be any pray send a small bunch of good large rangoes.
I hope I have committed no error in not sending the cano away yesterday. If I have I beg pardon: but all circumstances considered aright, I did it to save the Company's charges, for if I had not detaind her, I must today have putt the Company to 7a charges, to send up the slaves with the ballance of Octobers account, which I now by Mr Walker send, being 4mk 6oz 6a as per the accompts inclosed will appear. Also 4 men two women slaves: I have not in Octobers accompt charged them sent, being the 1st October, nither have I given credditt for the brass panns by reason my accompts were ffinished before they came, and desire an order that they may be returnd.
Here is two roles of tobacco, I know not the weight nor price. Here hath been severall to buy some, but know not how to adventure. I suppose it is the Company [sic], I would willingly be inform'd of the matter and I shall alwaiyes be ready to observe all your commands and use my utmost dilligence for my Royall Masters intrests while I am in their servis."
1101,2,461,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,02/11/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday soon affter Mr Walkers departure I received from Jonas Perrin by the hands of James Griffith his Agga account for October with the mony for the ballance thereof, which yesterday I examined in the presence of James Griffith, and hope it will goe safe, had a better opertunity presented would imbraced it. The Arcanys yesterday inquired for corrall and desired me to write for some, which if any begg a supply with the price per string or per ounce."
1102,2,462,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,04/11/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdayes date is safe come to hand, and have likewise received two cask of neptunes contayning three hundred and five, one bunch of rangoes containing fourteen hundred and ninety beads, which I wrote for as soon as any man demanded a sample to buy some. You seem somewhat dissattisffied at the charges when I came here, which I will assure you I really paid and was agreed on by Mr Humfryes and myselfe, and was the lowest they could be brought to, which we did beat as low as we were able. The letters at present I cannot find, but suppose the coppy is with you, by which as well as my memory dictates to me was to be as good husbands for the Company and come of as cheap as we could, which I take to be the substance of the letter.
Ampeteene this day came to me and sayes Mr Nightingale ows him 11 chests of come. I would know of him wheither I shall deliver him his pawn which he gave me, or elce to write me what the difference is betwixt for [he] sayes he will paniar on his head to the vallue. Now if he writes me word I will end that difference. There is not a day but I am troubled about his concerns. Ashedow has a great command of all the Arcanyes and told me today that none should come to trade here unless Mr Nightingale sattisfies him, soe leave it to your matter and due considerations to adjudg how disadvantagious it is to the Company that trade should be hindred for frivolous matter. The two casks of rum containing 77 gallons of rum is gon to Agga, and this cano now brings from thence 15 chests of corne. I have not paid the slaves for the last two months; they are at me this two dayes for payment, soe request what each slaves pay is, that may sattisfie them, and in what.
[PS] I have also paid Asheddo 5a for Mr Nightingales account rather than loose trade, which he really ows him, as letter per bearer can tell what he said."
1103,2,463,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,07/11/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yours per Peter I have received togather with two hundred iron barrs, and doe conjacture that by soe small a matter as the raiseing the price from 28 to 26ta I shall have smalle sayles this month. The letter at length I have se[a]rch [and] found in a booke in which I was fformerly reading, and have here inclosed sentt it you. As for the corne in my accompts it is 348 chests, which would easily apear by my receipt for all things in the ffactory. The beads I have since weighed and there is 780 pounds, soe begg it may be mentioned in my accompts. As for the corne, I beleive few Commanders will receive such if they can have new corne.
I have likewise received Bonashees pawne, that is his armring, which when he comes to demand it shall be delivered according to order. I have delivered Jonas [Perrin] his accompts and bid him rectifie them. On Frydaye I with Mr Walker [went] therewhere we inventoryd the warehouse, and find if it be true as he saith that he trusted Quabba with three sayes, if I have not the mony by tomorrow night I will againe take an exact accompt of every thing and demand the mony for all that is wanting, which if he makes not good your Worship shall here thereof, and then I beg If not before to have your possitive order, for I fear he is not as he should be. I beleive more than ordinary fate attends these places. There shall not any damage attrew [= accrue] for the future to the Company soe far as it lyes within the sphere of my capacity to remidy."
1104,2,464,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,07/11/1686,Fort,RAC,"Since my sealing of my letter of this date which goes likewise by this canoe, Bonashee came and demanded his pawne, which I tendred him, and when he saw [ms. 'say'] it he refused it, by reason he had not the neckring with it, which he sayes he has sattisfied for both and if he has not that you may keep both, this to pardon me that I rite you soe for this was his expression and many worse. Had above two howers dispute and would have him to take it, but he utterly denys it unless he hath the other with it, that is the reason Petter staid soe long, and hee understood and heard all the pallaver and can tell you the truth at large, if a black may be beleived. I have here enclosed the receipt which would have him sign; also have per Peter sent the ring back, he refusing it."
1105,2,465,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,08/11/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date I have received, and according to order sent this morning for Bonashee. He is still on his same string, harping to have the other ffittish, and sayes that Murrowando was his kinsman and that he neaver had any thing to doe with that neckring, and that when he pawned it to Mr Richard Thelwell he [= Murrowando] was Braffo; and that it was their custome that whenever a man is made Braffo he canot see the salt watter, and he sayes that last slave and five angles was in full for boath the pawns, and that he will take a ffittish before Doctor Griffen, and any other white man you will send down, if you will not beleive him then hee desires the slave and five angles againe. This palaver has taken up most of this morning, I have inquir'd of severall wheither Murrowando be liveing, some sayes yes at Annian, others sayes he is dead long since but not byryed, soe how to beleive them I know not, but I beleive he is dead. I also demanded of him that if any of his [= Murrowando's] ffreinds should ever demand this ffittish, he answered that he had neaver anything to doe with it. Shall immediately goe to Agga and there with Mr Walker inventory the warehouse and demand all the mony for all goods wanting, which if he complyes not with shall then ffollow your worships orders, but then I fear a future charge will then ffollow by putting in another, nevertheless Ile doe my Masters the justice they shall not be wronged or I myselfe injured as little as may bee. As soon as he has finished his Octobers accompts will send them up."
1106,2,466,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,09/11/1686,Fort,RAC,"According as I wrote you yesterday I with Mr Walker went to Agga and inventoryed the warehouse there, where found all the goods wanting as per the inclosed note amounte to 1mk 1o 11a 10. I demanded the money for the goods as I did the time before, he [= Jonas Perring] told mee he had trusted most of the money and if I would but stay a day or two he would endeavor to gett itt in all and bring it mee; I replyed this is your old pleay which you promised on Ffryday that if I would tarry but till Munday I should then have itt, and that I then cam for it and would not be putt off any longer, and allso taxt him with this letter inclosed which hee sent mee on Sunday, whereof you may playnly perceive the roguery of this ffellow. Farther James Griffin verryfyed it to his face that he saw soe much as his noate specified, which after soe taxed he humed and hawed and could not tell whatth [sic] to say, butt looked and shuffled things about, to looke if any money would appear. Att length he looked and found a bulce with finishes and other beads and some money, all weighing butt 6o 4a bare waite; I beleive the beads and ffittishes were borrowed. I had not been there a quarter of an hower but people swarmed about us mumbling and grumbling. I sent out scouts to understand what might be the meaning and in the pallavering hous it was sayd and agreed amoungst them that if Jonas was sent away noe other white man should come there. I made an end as soon as I could and brought away the key of the warehouse [so] that noe other goods should be imbazled, and I fear if I should send Mr Walker there they would doe him a mischief or any one elce, which make mee in truth amazed and require your farther order. I fear by his speaking Blackes it would be a difficulte matter to gett him away. Never was any man soe plagued att his firste entrance into an imployment as I am, what with trobles and noyse here and disquietting my self about Agga [so] that I have not a quiett houre in a day, and haveing so small a trade and soe great expence discomposes mee, butt patiance and hope my dayley companions has not forsaken mee. I humbly begg your speady answer and order to proceed in the affaire."
1107,2,467,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,10/11/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yours by Toby of yesterdayes date received the last nighte, and in pursuance to every one of your commands I have ffully effected and hope will give and render your Worships contente. I have now likwise thinking itt matteriall sent up the
money with ffitishes and as I received itt from Jonas Perrin and sealed whith his owne seale, and by whatt accompts he renders your Worshipe you may adjudge if whatt I have advised timely off be not reasonable to cleare mee of any defecte in relation to my Masters concerns, for I have done the parte of a servante that I would not lett them be any ways sufferers. The messenger that I sent for him tells mee that the house was full att Agga and making pallavers on James Griffin keeping the key, which I order'd him and sent another man there yesterday, not adjudgeing it safe [that] Mr Perrin should have itt any longer by reason he complyed not with promise, and fearing that goods to a greater value might goe to hatch money to make the other good, and having th[o]roughly sifted out the matter I finde more bran them [= then] meale; yett by reason I paste [= passed] my word to Cabushers and likweise to him before them, I would doe him no injury, soe begg you would be as favorable as in equity may bee. I feare all is not over yett, for a little of sparke kindles a greatt fire, and the firste smoake thatt appears Ile not fayle of rendering immediattly advise. It would in my opinion be verry nessessary that a Chiefe should be there, and not under this place. I am not covetious of itt, for if I should longer take the charge under such a one there, I should weave the webb of my owne woe and spinn the thread of my thralldome. If I should expatiate on this subjecte I could not be held a fflatterer butt rather a suffragante to truth. I submit to your candid judgements."
1108,2,468,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,11/11/1686,Fort,RAC,"Last night between the howres of 7 and 8 I received yours datted the 10 currante togather with teen chests of sheets and two bayles of perpettuanoes. Coming soe late I opened none butt deferd itt till this morning, I hope all are well and true according to what you mentioned. The canoe men were somewhat to blame in not looking better in coming a shoree, for the canoe shipd watter and wetted the cheste much. I will open all to see if any damaged, which I hope the beste. I had an indefferent good trade yesterday, I tooke aboute 2 mark and moste for neptunes and bassons; the neptunes are almoste gonn, and I hope today to have a good markett for sheets and perpetuanoes, for as soone as I received the goods in the warehouse laste night I was promised two more tomorrow, for blew perpetuanoes, butt I told them I must sell green with blew; they told me they would not give butt 7a for green, to which I answered they should have noe blew then. Iron barrs as informed your Worship stickes ahand since I rose them by order to 26 per bendy and have not sould one, soe what I have must ly longeer on hand or order to continew att 28 per bendy. Although I have endeavord to exercise the vivacity of my small capacity to bring them to it, it is as much to the purpose as to blow feathers againste a storme, and if I have hitherto committed any errors, which I hope not, I doe avow to repay that debt which the intreste of all my best endeavors and your commands shall be ever with mee and absolute law; and soe far hath my
duty to you lead mee to subscribe ever only I begg by firste conveniency aboute 20 or 30 deales to make place above stayers [= stairs] to take mony in, for have not any place fitting for that purpose, allsoe a carpenter."
1109,2,469,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,12/11/1686,Fort,RAC,"I wrott you yesterday morning I expected a verry good trade, which I might have had if would have sould all blwe [= blue] perpetuanoes without green, soe I sould butt two. Thee green will not fetch 6a apeice, I am suree it was noe good husbandry to pull all the fillits of, for that exposes the damage to veiw and does them noe good. I request your speedy answer, for they will buy none butt blew; if soe, I then can dispose of double the quantyty this month, or if any new greens be come to send some. I sould two chests of sheets yesterday and hope to have ready money in a shortt time for all. The neptunes are likwise now in demand, I have sould all and wante a supply of more of the same sortte I now send a sample by the bearer; if a little larger some, it would not be amiss soe they be verry slight and light, for they esteem of number as much as weight: the last held out verry good weight. Quashee was whith mee for to pay him for four hundred of wood and three chests of salte which was for the Coast frigatt, Mr Henry Wood Commander, the wood att four angles per cent, the salt att 3a per cheste. If Mr Nightingall has not paid or charged itt I begg your resolve about itt. The corne roome will be finished by tomorrow night, on Munday all the slaves shall goe and thatch the ffactory Agga."
1110,2,470,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,15/11/1686,Fort,RAC,"I had wrote to your worship on the 13th instante and then had sent it had it not been for Yabboe, who then cam to mee [and] makes a demand who should pay him six bendys which he lett Jonas Perrin have for ballance his October accounte till Mr Humfryes and I cam downe, Jonas telling him he would pay itt againe as soone as the Arcanyes cam to trade, he then telling him he had as much in cracra money but he knew that Mr Humfryes would not take itt; and Yabboy is resolved to have itt one wayes or other, soe I begg your Worship and Gentellmen to examine him stricktly aboute itt, butt I verryly beleive he will give as little insight into that as in all the reste, being alltogather obstinatte, and he must have all his money, for the blackes say that he never was a spendthrift. I have now sent up his trunck with papers, which will stand him in as much stead to make up his accompts as if nothing had been in it, it cam openn to mee, and soe I send it your worship. Here is now noe money stirring, by reason one Captain John, Captain Dickes brother, the last weeke went up to Cabo Corsoe aboard shipp, where he purposed to lay out six markes, butt not finding the goods he expected retturned and gave this answer to the Arcanyes and Cabusheers, that he h[e]ard there was two greatt ships to windward, soe the money is all stopted for a trade aboard them. I pray send per the first conveniency a bale of broad tapseeles and a cask of three pound pwetter [= pewter] basons and some stripitt sattins if any of the same sortte laste of 5 ft 5, butt pray whatt is sent lett them bee off a deep reed and a gold couler and if att that rate 30 or 40. The green perpetuanoes hinderes the sale of the blew. I turned the corne yesterday and itt is extremely dusty, and being old the weavell increases dayly, [I] doe what I can and if it be not verry speedily expended itt will be altogathar invalid, I writte nothing butt the truth; if any one gainsay itt, lett him be a spectator and an impartial Judge. I have bought noe corne as yett nor can not, for feare of this spoyling [the] other, though in a remotte partte yet vermin will spread abroad."
1111,2,471,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,22/11/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yours of this date I received about two houres since, and as soon as I received itt sent for all the slaves which belonged boath to Annamaboe and Agga which were buissey there, and as soone as they cam sett them at worke to through [ = throw] all the corne out from the roome over the kitchin and to carry itt in to the greatt yard to winnow itt and dust itt and then to putt it in the roome which I have now coverd, by reason there is noe weavells or virmin, and the roome where itt was Ile indeavor to cleare from all buggs &c, and if in one weekes time I see itt growes weavely Ile remove itt againe, and there shall be noe care wanting to save it. I have sent your worship a sample of boath according to order. This verry day I turned away money for all the blew perpetuanoess by reason they would not buy one green one; if you have any good green att Cabo Corsoe pray send 20, butt if they be the least touched they will not buy them. I have now by mee aboutt tenn marke of gold, and if may sell the blewes singley question not butt they will all be gone suddenly with other goods, soe begg your answer. The barer can informe you that all hands are att worke in order to your commands. If any thinge of news by Captain Butteram I begg a line. In the napkin you will find a noatt which is Annamaboe, and that is the best corne."
1112,2,472,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,03/12/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yours yesterday I received with two hundred iron barrs and two hundred and fower brasse diglins, all which shall dispose of according to order. This canoe alsoe returnes with 30 chestes of corne from Agga, alsoe all the broad niccanees that weare heare, all as I received them being accompted ninetye and a remnant in baggs. Heare is sletias and carpitt in a bad condittion, and what to doe with them I
knowe nott, for they are nott vendable. Likewise all the things which belonged to Jonas Perrin goes herewith. Since my being att Cabo Corso all the sheets are gon, soe desire as many chests as your worship cann well spare, for withoutt them I shall make butt a small months accompte. All thinges are in a quiet condittion here and well. This is the key of Jonas Perrins cheste."
1113,2,473,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,07/12/1686,Fort,RAC,"I received yours last night, att which I was amazed to heare of such complaints. First against niccanees, I had recourse to Mr Nightingalls accompte, and found noe narrow nor short as I remember thearin; and for the corne, itt was very well dusted I will averr when your worship ordered itt, and being the very bottom of the flower [= floor] and soe many buggs remaine in the corne roome, they presently entred againe, and all the heart being eaten some durst will reman in the hallow husk. I heare is now butt teen chests remaining att Agga, from whence the other 30 chestes went. This heare I take as good care of as any man canne, and will for every thinge else. If you will please to inspect the inventory you may see many dommaged [sic] goods, which you will all grant I cannot mend, butt my care shall be to preserve them. They have been twice taken downe and brusht, which is as Mr Walker sayes more than was done in 6 months before, and shall bee every month, and oftner if nessesity requires. Since my beeing heare I have advised for noe perrishable commoditye. The accompts shall bee sentt God willing tomorrow. They had gone today butt in a morning I am favored with many vissitations whch cannott shunn, though never soe much buissness. The Arcanians are just now gonn to fetch money for 20 barrills powder, which they say shall have in the afternoon; how to beeleive them I know nott, butt praye a suply of that commodite tonight if possible. Bonnishee is with mee att this instant and these are his very words, the Agent Blackman[s] good freind and doe all Black man very good, butt hee noe savee for what hee noe love mee, butt I love him and tell him to make all pallavra succaba, Ile give him a very good woeman and then hee send mee the two pawnes and then Umbra Cooshie, that is to say a finall conclusion."
1114,2,474,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,07/12/1686,Fort,RAC,"I wrote your worship this morning that the Arcanians had been with mee for
powder and that they would bring money this afternoon, which since I have received for 16 barrells, alsoe for 1: 2 and 3 pound pewtter bassons, of which I bage [= beg] you would bee pleased tomorrow to send 20 barrels powder, 400 1 pound bassons, 200 2 pound, 200 three pound ditto, for have past my would [= word] they shall have some tomorrow. They are very importunate for sheetts, which I tould them I beeleived theare was none. Here is a greate quantite of money and more would dayly come had wee butt such goods as they want, which I shall nott nominate knowing theare is none to suply me with all; what I now write for I hope tomorrow early to receive."
1115,2,475,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,09/12/1686,Fort,RAC,"Last night per the cano I received both your letters togather with thirty barrells of powder, four chest sheets, three hundred two pound pewter basons, two hundred three pound ditto. The major part of the basons I had mony for, soe hope in a shorte time to send for more of the same commodities, for I doe not hold it discression to send for great quantityes at a tame [= time], for then they will but blow upon goods, and being soe near where I may suddainly be supplyd will cause a greater eagerness in them to take what I have. Bonashee last night sent in a woman slave according as he promised and hopes your Worship will be as good as your word. By this cano I have sent up three men and one woman besides that of Bonishees, also according to your Worships order twenty chests of Annamaboe corne, which I will say is clean, and so is all here or that shall come from hence. The accompts I have sent up all signed by myselfe, and the errors rectified in James Griffins time. I want paper much. This is the ultimate val[u]e of what I have."
1116,2,476,Rice Wight,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,13/12/1686,Fort,RAC,"Last night we got safe down and meat with a civil reception. This morning early in order to your command began the inventory [of] the warehouse, which I find more difficult than I apprehended, by reason of the damaged goods, soe that I fear I shall not dispatch in the time limitted, but what I came about shall be done effectually. Several of the damaged sayes are sold to Captain Quashee. I shall not enlarge."
1117,2,477,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,14/12/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yours yesterday with three hundred two pound pewter basons and two hundred three pound ditto and four chests of sheets have received. Have concluded the inventory of the warehouse here and am just goeing to Agga. This cano carryes 2 men 1 woman slaves and 20 chests of corn. Mr Whiteing is arrived and somewhat
indisposed and will stay till to morrow to refresh himselfe. Shall if your Worship thinks convenient towards the end of the month waite upon you with my accompts and the ballance.
[PS] The woman that was sent last was Bonashes."
1118,2,478,Rice Wight,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,14/12/1686,Fort,RAC,"Your letter of yesterday date have received by Mr Elwes. Your orders therein shall be observed, [he] being this morning goeing to Agga. Last night ffinished the warehouse here and hope to compleat all this night that I may return to Cabo Corso tomorrow.
[PS] Powder is verry scarce. Mr Whiteing[s] cano is in sight and since came on shore, but much indisposed."
1119,2,479,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,15/12/1686,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys Mr Rice Whight, by whome goes the inventory of boath ffactoryes signed under our hands according as ordered, with the accompte of what goods has been disposed of, since the 1st of the month. I have nigh twenty marke of gold by mee for boath ffactorys, besides all the people paid this month. I am hartily glad off soe good a neighbor as Mr Elwes, with whome will bare so ffriendly a correspondence as may be, and question not butt itt will be for our masters intrests. I hope all things will be to your satisffaction, and then my joy att present is compleate."
1120,2,480,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,15/12/1686,Fort,RAC,"Since what I wrote per Mr White a chapman has presented for good markt iron barrs, which I have not any good ones left which they approve of, so pray send per first conveniency, tonight if possible, three hundred.
[PS] I begg some paper of both large and small. I have 4oz for barrs."
1121,2,481,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,17/12/1686,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships yesterday by the 17 hand cano with three hundred iron barrs is received. If any defect in the inventory, as your Worship and Gentlemen signifie, it shall be corrected and amended. I have since told over severall goods and find them more than what was inserted in the inventory, and in my monthly acount. All things shall be rectified. The sayes Mr Wight sold had like to be returned again, for
Assina blowing of the mony and finding it so bad that he tarried and took up a great deal of tim, as indeed it required time to be well pickt. Quashee after the departure of Mr Wight, was in such a rage that he would return all againe. All the mony I have sent by itselfe, as also that for the ffactory of Agga. I humbly begg your excuse that the account is not transcribed, for were a sheet of paper to be the ransom of the cuntrey, I have it not, and I have wrote for some more than once; I am brought to the necessity that I am constrained to return you part of what letter is sent to me, which this is by Ridly Horsford. Your order is obeyed for I have sent up in all 20m 6oz 12a, all that I have by me for both ffactoryes. I have not elce to add but humbly return you thanks for your invitation at Christmas, which if health permitt shall not fayle to kiss your hands."
1122,2,482,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,18/12/1686,Fort,RAC,"The bearer being an Arcany man is sent on purpose to be sattisfied whether your Worship ordered me to sell iron at 24 barrs per bendy, which in the mergent [= margin] of your worship and Councell of the 16th instant it is so, which I observed according and will let none goe under. I have this morning by their approbatious [= opprobrious] language abused and they say I keepe the mony my selfe for 4 barrs which in Mr Nightingales time they use to have 28, so pray sattisfie the bearer it is your order. They say they will all leave this place they tell me, as the bearer will inform your Worship. Here is mony for powder and sheets, and more dayly expected. I have for two or three dayes been endeavouring to raise the price of powder to 18a, the Dutch haveing none, but cannot, but doe thinck at 10 [for] 1oz to put a quantity of[f], if they are as good as their words. I should inlarge had I paper, I beg I may be supplyed by the bearer."
1123,2,483,Ridley Horsford,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,28/12/1686,Fort,RAC,"Last night Mr Elwes and selfe arrived at Annamaboe, and this morning Mr Walker is bound for Cabo Corso in the cano we came in. As for what I have seen he hath left all things in good order, belonging to the Company concerns. In the meantime shall be careful what lyes in me."
1124,2,484,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,30/12/1686,Fort,RAC,"According to your order yesterday morning we began to inventory the warehouse, and today by noon shall compleat it and tomorrow your Worship shall have it. Yesterday in the affternoon the Cabusheers were with me for their accustomary Christmas dashees and told me today they would have it. I desird them to tarry untell such time that I heard what your Worship and Gentlemen would allow, they answerd they would not be delayd, I had been at Cabo Corso and that you had
orderd me to give what other men had done before me, they were sure, and that twas not mine but the Companys pleasure to give it them, and that they would have it. I endeavoured what possible I could with reason to perswade them to mittigate the charge, telling them that the Company was at great charge when I came here; but all argument proved to no purposes for they told me I should not debar them from their right which had been given them by my predecessors. Their insolency is in realty so great that it is not sufferable. These begs your Worship an answer, what was given the last year, for so much they say they will have, I beleive rather more than less for they talk of great matters. Pray take it not amis that Ridly Horsford stays so long, tomorrow he shall return. If your Worship think it convenient I will send up the mony that I have."
1125,2,485,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,31/12/1686,Fort,RAC,"I here inclosed sent your Worship an account of all the goods in Annamaboe. I have delivered Boneshee his two pawns as per the inclosed receipt, so desire mine againe. He would not sign to a receipt for the pawn in Braffo Murranadoes [sic] name but as his own. Have now sent up 4mk 3 a of which two ounces is on Agga account. I am almost bated to death with these people. I desire your Worship to speak to Mr Nightingale to give me advise how he disposed the dashees and to whome. This cano takes in but 10 chests corn by reason of Mr Walkers things."
1126,2,486,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,01/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"I received yours yesterday dated the 30th ultimo, at which thime all the Cabusheers with many others were assembled together makeing their demands for their severall Christmas dashes, which I would have abaited as much as I could, but they rather stood to have it augmented. I could not stay them of a minute, they would have itt and more to. Now Asheddo is Captain of the Arcanyes and another second, he tells me that your Worship promised him a cloth, which he insists on and sayes I detain it from him, although yesterday I gave him a red perpetuanoe and a case of liquor, which he sayes is usuall to the Arcanyes besides a cloth to the Captain and second. He threaten no trade shall come without two cloths of 10a price be given him and second, pray your answer. Though yesterday I ended with the men I have still a great plauge with the women, who will not lett me alone; which way to take I know not, fair means work not, I am almost att my witts end, I wish three or four dayes over that I might be at quiett. Have not elce farther to add only the messenger is sent by the Arcanyes to know your pleasure."
1127,2,487,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,04/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"Haveing this opertunity by Captain Peter of conveying my December accounts with the ballance, have thought it requisite to send them, the mony being 1mk 1oz
6a for Agga accounts till Mr Elwes time. Your Worship shall receive them as soon as they are finished, which I am now about; you had received them long since had I not been interrupted by the noyse and clamers of these people. I received yours ordering the purchaseing of corn but as yet have not got one chest, but as it comes in will render advice. When I was at Cabo Corso one of the Arda men went up theither, and as yet is not come down, his name is Hans, desire your Worship to send him, or another in his roome. Here is no trade by reason of two ship[s] here and one to windward.
[PS] Just as I was sealing this up I received yours intemating the complaynts of the Cabushers saying the Castle is cold, if it be hotter I am sure I am not able to continue in it. The allowance of rum goes but a verry small way in the heat, their is not a day yett hath passed over my head since my being here but it hath cost me a gallon rum besides the double monthly allowance. What they would have is brandy and that I am not able to afford; to be more liberall of the Company goods I will not, and of my own I cannot, and in that I consider the Company intrest. I am very willing to be at quiett but these are a people trobled with a nunquam satis. They never complayned to me of what you intimate. This fellow was sent on purpose to acquaint you that I will not take Fanteen mony, which they bring in great quantityes and bad, nither will they suffer it to be well pickt, which will be to my loss. Ask Captain Peter, he will tell you it is the reason of their complaint."
1128,2,488,William Halford,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,08/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"Mr Hassell and myselfe are now takeing an inventory of the warehouse, of which I had sent your Worship a coppia, but takeing a particular account of all the goods to se wheather they have been cut, takes up more time than I did imagine. The first opertunity I will send up an exact coppie, in the intrim I hope you will be pleased to excuse [William Halford]."
1129,2,489,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,09/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 7th instant I have received by Mr Halford, to whome shall shew civillity. The Cabushers are now all gon into the cuntrey. I have not received one chest of corn as yett; this that is here growes dayly worse and worse though I doe my utmost to preserve it. Tomorrow shall finish inventoring the warehouse. Here is now no manner of trade by reason of two ships here and others to windward, but hope the next week it will mend."
1130,2,490,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,11/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"Just now came down Boneshee from Fanteen, being sent from the Braffo and Curranters, hereing that the Ackims and Aguinas are comeing upon them, they say they want powder to fight them, and have sent to be trusted with four barrells of powder and one ounce in lead barrs, and say they will pay out of their monthly customes, and if they are conquer[er]s in slaves. I will not doe it of myselfe but by your order, so beg your immediate answers, and a supply of more powder. I am constraind upon your [= their] great importunity to write this. Nothing of trade presents, they being all up the cuntrey. Pray send no powder except you intend to trust them. I have delivered 4 sayes to have corn in eight dayes for them, being baited almost to death to doe it."
1131,2,491,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,11/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours with my December accounts have received, which are sent down to be rectified according as you write at the foot of the letter, which I will not be so prophane as to call the God of truth to be wittness to a lye, but this I will aver that for me or to my knowledg they are the same goods as formerly I received for broad nicconees, no more nor no less nor otherwise to my knowledg without any equivocation or mentall preservation [= reservation], and this I will aver as God shall be my help; and if you think I doe with any fraud endeavour to put an injury upon any man, I averr I have no such thought nor intention, and lett the saddle be laid on the right horse, I received them so. Pardon me writeing so bluntly, but it is nothing but truth, which I will aver before the Almighty to whom I appeal. I also perceive that since the 6th December one broad nicconee is wanting of what was then mentioned, so there may be mistakes in the best of men. I have sent the account back againe and beg a more favorable judgment and not such seveire sentence on the innocent to that concerne. This affternoon I have taken in sixty chests of corn which I have not paid for, and tomorrow and affterwards shall have more, but not to be had under 112<math id=""actrade-9780197262528-math-30"" display=""inline"">

</math>a per chest, which they say is the usuall rate, or 11 chest for a say &ca pro rato. Not a cracra stirring. It is the generall fear of all this cuntrey, nay an undoubted truth that the Achims with the Anguinas are goeing to fight the Accrongs, which these people are to protect, and Ahenesah will
undoubtedly be on the back of the Achims to help Fanteen. We hope it will be a good time shortly for slaves. The corn that I shall have within this three or four dayes, with the corn I had from Mr Nightingales, I hope to make it betwixt 400 or 500 chests."
1132,2,492,William Halford,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,15/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"I have here inclosed an inventory of the warehouse and I have take all the possible care I could in laying up the goods so that they may not take any more damage, so I shall use my utmost endeavour to keep all the goods neat and clean which I receive from Cabo Corso."
1133,2,493,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,15/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"These serve for covert of the accounts for Agga till such time that Mr Elwes took charge. They should have been sent up sooner but I tarried till I had received the ballance, which I received at three times, and have sent it up, being 6a 13ta. Also I have inclosed the accounts which were sent to be coppied over, but not that which Jonas signd, for that I reserve for my selfe without you are pleased to have that. [As] to corn [it] comes in but slowly either here or at Agga. I have not in all received above one hundred and twenty chests and I beleive Mr Elwes none, for the news of war and preparation thereto hath so allarmed this town that they are all gon to Fanteen except it be the ffishermen, women and children. Here is not 50 fighting men in Annamabo and all the adjacent crooms, and till such time as they return cannot expect any corn. I beleive shall not take so much mony this month as will sattisfie charges. I purpose today to goe to Annishan and agree for two or 300 chests and so to have it sent of to the ship that shall next come, if it stands with your approbation, pray by return of the messenger a word, but I would willingly have the old corn aboard first, for if he has the new corn he'l hardly take the old and when that is gon I shall have roome enough for 1000 chests more, for I dare not mix new with old."
1134,2,494,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,17/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"I received yours of this dayes date while I was at Annishan measureing the corn, where I am promised 3 or 400 chests of corn. I have left Henry Underhill there to measure it and with all have given order to receive whatever good corn they bring tomorrow and next day. I have exactly three hundred and forty chests here with Mr Nightingales corne, which I hope you will order to be shipt first. I have now also sent a note to Mr Elwes to se what corn he has and what he can purchase.
I have done as much as possible could for Mr Halford and selfe on Satterday went to Annishan to agree for corn. They stood on their terms then and would not comply anything reasonable, imagining we wanted corn to goe to them. Beleive as you will but it is far better to be always stockt with 1000 chests than to want 100, for they know when it is their harvest time to reap both the beneffitt and gather the gleaning, and this I beg, whenever a ship comes next you would be so kind as to send a cano or canoes to carry it off to the boat, for I cannot gett one of any size for love or mony, although I have endeavourd much, have sent to Laggue and there is not one to be had by reason of the warrs. The times here are extraordinary dull, here is not twenty able men left in the twone [= towne], they begin to be fearfull and bring their gold chests in the Castle. In fine, I know not what their apprehentions are unless it is with fear of success. God grant it be for the best. Today have sold 2oz of snaphances and 1oz lead barrs, and they say will have more dayly, so beg a supply of both, with good ammunition and more men for our own safegard and the Company intrest. I write in hast according to your commands."
1135,2,495,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,19/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdayes date I have received by Peter, together with 50 snaphances and 50 lead barrs. There is 13 of the snaphances halfe of the but ends broak of, one without a lock and severall almost out of the stocks. If I am charged with firelock musquetts pray lett the denomination be altered, for they are not so. Shall not lett slip any opertunity but render advice upon the least prospect of a trade and intimate particularly the goods that shall or will vend. I have by this cano sent up twenty chests of corn. To answer about the nicconees, and speaking my mind freely, I am very loath to lanch out any mony for what I never received. If they were narrow I protest they were as I received them, without any addition or alteration or demunition but only [= except for] the six peices which I sold. Your Worship and Gentlemen are men of reason, and I propose this: a negro payes for one sort of goods and through mistake receives another, afterwards he calls himselfe to mind he paid for the other, which comes to more, you will in justice sattisfie him. Though this may well be against me, yett I plead that the transgressor, be who it will, that first gave them the denomination of broad nicconees and alterd the prosperty [= property] of the goods [should] make restitution, for it is very severe for one man to pay for anothers default, so hope your candid constructions of this will administer justice to [Ralph Hassell]."
1136,2,496,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,27/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdayes date I have received, and concerning what corn I have now is 113 chest of old corn, haveing shipt but 100 aboard Captain Hosea and forty five sent to Cabo Corso this month. I have but 15 chests of new corn, but in 4 or 5 dayes I can have from the Annishan people paid in their 4 or 5 hundred chests if they are as good as their words. I shipt from thence in one day, near two hundred chests. I am promised much here but here is no people to bring it in, but they say in a dayes time or two people will come downe, which I give little creditt to, for as far as I can understand they are in great consternation of mind, fearing much Ahenesahs aid, for they say he will scarce come to their assistance, and the Aboncames makes incursions on their territores dayly, approaching nearer and nearer. This is what I can learn at present. If any ffurther occurrences happen shall not fail to advise.
Assina sayes that whilst he lived at Succondee he had the allowance of three angles per month, he takes care in blowing the mony and likewise is i[n]steed of Captain Dick the interpreter, so I request your answer to this and whether I may take any quantitty of corn at Annashan. Here I am promised more dayly, as it comes in will dayly advise you."
1137,2,497,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,29/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date I received and as soon as I read the contents imediately sent a man to Annishan to measure corn and thing [= think] to goe thether my selfe today to agree for the quantity you order, for here I cannot gett any, being no people to carry it, all being gon into the cuntrey, and when have any quantity will advise. You write I may sell narrow nicconees at 3a, I never had none that I know of, nor flowerd silk longees.
As concerning the warrs I know no farther than what I advised of in my last, but that they expect the enimy to give the ffirst onsett, they being all prepard. As any other news shall happen will render an account. Here is much wanted some tarr and trucks for great gunns, also spunges for have not one, some small shott, ladles and worms for minion and faulcon, which are the biggest guns [we] have, some match and cathridge paper, some old junck for wads. I want short irons, haveing but 3 pieces, for whenever I sent slaves I never receive any back. Also firelocks."
1138,2,498,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,03/02/1687,Fort,RAC,"These accompanyes my January accounts with the ballance, which is so small that I am in a maner ashamed to insert it in computation of the foregoeing month, it being but 2mk 10ta. I much fear as yett the alteration or increase of better times till Dame Fortune crowns these people with victory, which they in my apprehension seem dubious of, for yesterday they sent from Fanteen to command all able men to bear arms up thither and hung a fittish at the gate that no man should come to trade to sell any corn or any other thing, butt imediately to repare with arms to Ffannteen. I was forced to give the Braffo and Cabushers to take it down againe 2 lead barrs and 12<math id=""actrade-9780197262528-math-31"" display=""inline"">

Quashe presents his servis to you, who came down last night to settle his affairs before the battle. I humbly request 3 or 4 men more by the return of the cano, I will if you please send up three of the greatest sotts in Guine, which much perplex me by their sottishness. I beg you would send John Pound down as a serjant, for I much want a sober man for that place, and I take him to be one; if you have one a fitter man in your estimation, I refer it to your grave judgment. Likewise for what I wrote for in my last, with a pair of moulds to make shott. If any four pound basons at Cabo Corso may send what you can, halfe to Mr Elwes and halfe to me, for I have been desired to write for them and so hath Mr Elwes in my hearing. I have not mentiond any thing about the nicconees in my accounts by reason they were not inserted in the last, but when I know what you will demand, if you will be so hard as to extract from me I must refound."
1139,2,499,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,07/02/1687,Fort,RAC,"I received yours of the 5th instant yesterday and perceive thereby your displeasure in mine which you formerly received. If I could tell in what, I would strive to amend it and shall for the future avoid inserting any thing but what is the Company concerns. I did not imagine anything in mine could be taken for flattery in the least. The putting up the fittish at the gate was on this wise: the Braffo and Quarranters had sent for powder and shott, which I denyed thinking it but frivilous and that it had been no such thing; the next day without any notice to me the Fittisherers came and put it up, forbiding on pain of their displeasure any man to trade for corn or goods &ca before I could advise you of itt, [and] denyd any sustenance to supply us, and rather than want provitions, and fearing itt would increase by neglecting to grant their demands, I paid it. I canot learn that I was in any wayes impossed on, they are so insolent now that a man can hardly stand sentinell at the gate but they affront him one way or another without the least occasion in the world. I had not mentioned any thing about Yabboy had I not been importuned by him, and for the future I will not meddle or make any more with other mens business of that nature. If these ships have brought perpetuanoes, sheets and tallow I desire your Worship to send me some. Trade is now very dull by reason of the warrs. Per the cano have sent 20 chest of corn. Have not now sent up the men, haveing so few men left to doe duty which are able."
1140,2,500,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,11/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"By Henry Clements I received yours of yesterdays date, whome I will assist to the utmost of my power upon all occasions as shall be requisite against the settlement of the French if they attempt it, and if they doe I will render timely advise and observe orders as from time to time as you shall direct. I purpose in the evening to goe to Annishan and se what quantity of corn comes in there, for I have not heard from there this two dayes and when I know I will give your Worship an account and withall beg that a ship may come and fetch it away with what I have here. I want much some sheets, blew perpetuanoes, tallow, boysadoes that are good, for want of which I have no trade. Pray supply me likewise with what I advised for in mine of the 29th January last and 9th instant. This is the needfull at present, only I beg some paper, being in great want for it to answer what letters may come."
1141,2,501,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,13/02/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date received together with the goods therein mentioned, which will use my best endeavour to dispose of, and also desire that as soon as any perpetuanoes come you will spare some. I have veiwed my coppy of November account and cast it up article per article and canot find the error out, soe I beg your favour to know where it lyes, that I may be righted. If to my prejudice I acknowledg that in January account and will make it good. I render you humble thanks, for giveing me account of my mistakes and will endeavour to amend, elce I should be disingenious to be obstinate. I have now sent up Jeremiah Mitchell and Samuel Walker, the former is Jeremy, a person that is so ill humourd, thatt not but wisht him hence many times. There is nothing said nor acted but what he relates to the Blacks and in generall is very abusive. Walker is desireous to come up (though faulty by two much drinking). I have sent up John Teag the gunner, he hath an account of what is wanting and hope you will be pleased to supply according to your promise. I also desire some paper for have none for accounts, or letter[s]. I have endeavourd by every vessell to supply myselfe, but canot for love or mony. I pray by next to spare a quarter casque of palm oyle, for here is none to be had."
1142,2,502,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,16/02/1687,Fort,RAC,"By the cano you sent yesterday I received yours together with three white men and John Teag the gunner, the stores also therein inserted falling right, which will endeavour to use to utmost advantage, and se everything managed for the best. Likewise received two bails of perpetuanoes and two chest of sheets, for which shall give credditt for in my accounts accordingly and endeavour the best I can for to vend them. I have received the paper and quils which comes in time of necessity. Will also take notice about the mens pay. I canot deny but the corn is bad. I wish I could help it, I doe the best I can. Captain Hosea said if many of his slaves dyed when they feed on it he will make a protest against it, these were his words and Chilper advised him to it."

Yesterday they fought and vanquished them and have taken (if they report not a lye) many slaves. I would this morning timely [have] rendred this advise but such crouds of people comeing in bringing the heads of the victory would not admitt me any leasure untell now, unless I would have undergon the scandall, reproach and ill will of these people, who are upon the last [= least] occasion of this nature, apt to reflect upon a whole nation. It hath cost me this morning most considerable in liquor to congratulate their good success; and I hope within few dayes slaves will come in, so beg to have a good supply of irons, and as they come in will render advise of it that so I may send them up. The Captain of the Arcanyes is come to Annishan and has sent to write to your Worship for goods to be sent there. I sent Henry Clements back to tell him that whatever he wanted I would supply him from hence, as yett have no answer to that. I have about 170 chests of corn at Annishan and begg your Worship and Gentlemen that the first ship that wants corn may take it in, for I hold it not safe to lett it abid there, as here and now may have in a short time corn enough here. May it please your Worship Quashee is come down; and this I send by his sonn who beggs that which I told him could not be granted, which is that Docter Macdowall might come and se his hand, he has lost the forefinger of the left hand and his thum cutt much; I advised him immediately to go himselfe, but he sayes he cannot as yett, he would not be quiett till I sent."
1145,2,505,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,08/03/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdayes date have received by Daniell Coopeman and shall follow your orders and directions therein. By this cano have sent up nine very good men slaves, likwise what Mr Elwes has bought, which is twelve men, in all is 21. I have very dull trade and I am much frustrated in my expectations of buying corn, for they hold it at extraordinary rates, and are a goeing to war again but with whom they will not tell, but it's conjectured with the Fetues."
1146,2,506,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,10/03/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of this dayes date have received, and in answer thereto I have at Annishan on the Company account one hundred and seaventy chests of corne, with what have here will make up one hundred twenty odd. For the slaves I have sent up were all very good and not the least defected. I shall acquaint the Cabusheers of your command about corne and slaves although I beleive to little purpose, for they will not take under two angles per chest."
1147,2,507,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,11/03/1687,Fort,RAC,"I sent this messenger on purpose and beg a supply of irons, for slaves present and have not one pair of irons left. I have speak to Bonneshee for corn and slaves, and his answer is they must all meet together first, which will be to morrow, and you shall know their minds, and when I know shall acquaint your Worship."
1148,2,508,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,13/03/1687,Fort,RAC,"I received yours of yesterdayes date, also tenn pair of irons, and have sent up 3 slaves, which is all I have bought. Trade is very dull and I fear shall take very little mony more than what will defray charges of the Factory. They ask very dear for corn, and say they will not take less than two angles per chest, and say it will grow dearer, they pretend a great scarcety by reason of the warr.
In fine they are very great villians, and a combyned pack of knaves as any in Guyney, and no beleife in thm.
Henry Henderson desires to goe to Cabo Corso to bleed and purge for a humour in his arme."
1149,2,509,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,19/03/1687,Fort,RAC,"Just now by Captain Draper I received yours ordering me to ship three hundred and thirteen chests corn on board him, in case I had so many. Mr Elwes and my selfe can supply him, and if your Worship and Gentlemen pleases to send down a 9 or 7 hand cano will dispatch him with what expedition I can, and with[out] a cano I cannot put any aboard. I have endeavourd the purchaseing of a cano, and cannot, by reason of the warrs in those parts where they are.
Yesterday the corne roome at Annamaboe, one side brake downe and much corne lost, the people makeing use of such advantages. I begg that I may have a cano down to night."
1150,2,510,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,24/03/1687,Fort,RAC,"By this cano you will receive ten men slaves which were bought at Agga, Mr Elwes desireing me to send them up. The cano had returned yesterday had not the men been lazy. I have sent up a white man to look affter them, and at his return request a hogshead lyme and a hogshead of tarris for the Castles use. Now the rains comeing on it is and will be much wanted,
Captain Draper is not gon as yett but tarries to make up his complement of corn, which I beleive cannot be effected here,
I wrote in one of myne lately that he might have had it here, which I could have performed had not one end of the house at Annishan falne down, and these people kept there words with mee, for have paid for much more, but I see and find no cridditt is to be given to what they say, so that I am altogather weary of this place, and am not able to maintaine the charge they da[i]ly putt me two [= to], unless I should runn out the Royall Company goods, so humbly offer it to your considerations."
1151,2,511,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,27/03/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdayes date with a cask of lyme and a cask of tarris I have received, and shall observe your orders as to the purchaseing of corn. I would willingly a waited on you but am not very currant. I wish you all a merry Easter."
1152,2,512,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,31/03/1687,Fort,RAC,"By the bearer of this I received yours and shall follow your orders therein. On Sattrday Mr Halford shall goe up and carry my accounts with the ballance, which is but verry small. Have allready begann to inventory the warehouse and shall effecte it by the time prescribed, that is tomorrow night."
1153,2,513,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,01/04/1687,Fort,RAC,"This accompany's Mr William Halford and serves for covertt of my March accounts, by whome have also sent up the ballance thereof, being six ounces and three taccoes, a verry inconsiderable quantity to the proportion of the charge, God send times to alter. I have alsoe sent up the inventory of all the goods, which agrees with the remaynes in my accounts. I am sorry to write of dammage done by ratts, which is verry much, especially in the allejarrs: we are so pester'd with them that they are not easely destroyd, although keep three catts in the warehouse. I have enclosed here a noat of severall perticularrs which is much wanting, and desire to have them if possible as soon as may bee; also pray send on the Company account 200 iron barrs, two cases sayes, and six roles of tobacco if any, also a case of looking glasses. I have not as yett received above 7 chests of corn but am promised at 2a per chest a quantity if they faill not,

1154,2,514,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,05/04/1687,Fort,RAC,"I received yours of yesterdayes date by the nine hand cano with one hundred and fifty iron barrs, and severall stores under mentioned therein; only the four shackles for the long irons are wanting, so that they are of no use. I doe desire two cases of sayes, and two hogsheads of rum, with hasps and staples for the windows. Here is no trade for any manner of commodities but drams given for ackeys, which makes me dissatisfied very much to think that I am so unfortunate a servant to my Masters, I wish the times may alter, elce I shall be a shearer in their sufferings"
1155,2,515,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,08/04/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the sixth instant I have received, togather with my March account which you sent down to rectifie, to which answer that for the 45 chests of corn which was lost and spoyled at Annishan. I will make affidavit that I paid for one hundred seventy five chests putt into that house which fell, and when it was removed to another it measured out one hundred and thirty by the same chest strict measure. Then for slaves which were bought for sayes, you are pleased to say that I know they are rated att 1oz in barter, which I aver I know no such thing or that ever I was orderd so, except for corn, which indeed I have formerly wrote orders for. I thought the slaves very reasonabley bought, which is 7 peez per man at 14a per say. Then Gentlemen to the complaint about the great charge in carrying the corn of; which I will demonstrate to you I had hyred a 9 hand canoe the day before the Cape Coast cano came down, att Annishan, not knowing wheither I should have had one. I gave 3a for the use of the cano, and paid the canoemen 4a and paid Annishan people to carry the corne down 3a, haveing but 3 of the Company slaves there, besides 1 of the Cape Coast canomen and Mr Elwes canomen, for he sent me his cano; and what I paid is more than what I charged in my accounts. Hope this will be sattisfactory and to content, and as for affidavitt or attestation for the corn Ile send my own who, paid for so many chests there, if that will be sufficient. I also received by the cano two cask of rum, and 50 iron barrs with 4 shackles, but one revitt. The mony that I sent up am sorry proves not to content, but this I can assure you it is without any mixture by me and just as I received it; and for the future will pick it better."
1156,2,516,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,09/04/1687,Fort,RAC,Since mine of yesterdayes date I have received your order to what noats James Bayly shall charge on me for oyster shells. The contents shall observe according to order.
1157,2,517,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,11/04/1687,Fort,RAC,"This morning came several Arcanyemen and bought all the sheets I had that was good, and told me withall that the way was now open and desired mee to write for more sheets and perpettuanoes. I have not had any trade this month till today and have taken 12oz. I also sent to Mr Elwes on his noate for the Royall Companyes account 9 perpetuanoes, soe that I beleive he has a trade likewise. I desire 50 perpettuanoes; 10 chests of sheets; 200 lookinke glasses in sorts no 3, 4, 5; tenn barrells powder, for I sould 3 today and more asked for, which if sent tomorrowe theyle not carry their money to the Duche, for they cannot tarry as they pretend. This goes by Henry Clements and Assina. For Clements being at Anisham, it is to
noe purpose and if you intende to send any goods and to settle it he is abusive and not fitt to be with any ffactor there, this I thought good to advise your worshipe and Gentlemen. If your inclinatione is to settle Anisham I heare that there is som money there now, which I offerd to furnish them with what goods they wanted, butt they are for haveing goods there, which in my judgement will not quitte the expense the company will be at, soe leave it to your consideration."

Had there bene any fraude found therein it would have been a good reason to object against them, butt knowing there is none imboldens mee to speake in my owne behalfe. For the barrell of powder expended, wheithere or noe it was ever the companies orders that their garrisons should not with respecte answere salutes from their owne vessells, nay if a stranger out of complement salutes, either of you would you not thinke it unbeseeming yourselves to dis[r]especte civillity, nay whether by the Companys letters establishment or otherwise they ever stinted or gave limitts to what salutes should be answered by their garrisons, soe much as a barrell of powder was really spent bona fide and without any lafishment As for better sattisfactione of the corne being lost, shall send up affidavitt when have transcribed my accompts, by reason my name was calceld.
The 50 perpettuanoes and 10 barrells powder is received and shall for the future observe your orders for buying of slaves with sayes, which will be none, for today I see Bonneshee sell 8 men for good gold att 30a per man to the Arcanyes to carry up into the country, and if a Blacke gives soe much one to another they will exacte more from a white man, soe leave all under your judicious considerations, which hope will produce favorable constructions for [RH]"

1160,2,520,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,22/04/1687,Fort,RAC,"This serves for coverte of the certificatte you wrote for in your laste, and is alsoe to desire you to lett mee know what has been the usuall custome to be given the Braffoe and Quarranters of Fanteen and Cabusheers of Annamaboe, att their putting their corne in the grounde. I never knew of it till juste the day, and sayed they could nor would not tarry till I had acquainted my selfe, soe by their hideous taunts I gave 8 gallons of rum and 12<math id=""actrade-9780197262528-math-33"" display=""inline"">

1161,2,521,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,28/04/1687,Fort,RAC,"Just now received the inclosed from Mr Whiteing, and desired mee to send itt to you.

I have not hearde from Mr Bailey since he came downe nor have I seen anybody to demand sattisfaction for any more then 58 butts of shells, which I have paid. I have Mr Bailys tally, and as they demand sattisfaction shall pay them. Trade continews verry dull."

Likewise to spare a man slave or two, for have no more since Hanse went up then [= than] four men, and two are not able to worke for worms in their leggs. Alsoe pray (if any are made) some hookes and staples for the windowes, 12 hookes 24 staples, for the rust have devoured all these here soe that they are altogether useless."

I have been threatened this weeke to bee sent from hence, and now tomorrow expect to here farther, these fellows being come, and for what unless I would give all the Companies goods away, they are soe unreasonable they know not what to have. I writte this in haste, that you would consider and send some one early to morrow to know their demands.

According to your orders have now sent you per this canoe a woman and child bought per me, also one woman which was formerly bought by Mr Elwes. Three dayes since one of the Royall Companyes slaves named Andrew, which was mason, dyed of the fflux. This night a great part of the stone wall which inclosed the yard towards the town fell downe; so desire those things I left an accompt of when at Cabo Corso with Christopher Price, also if possible two or three hogsheads of lyme and tarras.

1171,2,531,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,12/06/1687,Fort,RAC,"I received yours of yesterdayes date, wherein you intimate your dislike of my informing Mr Elwes whether I had paid the Braffo and Quarenteers six pieze per month for custom. All the time it was under my charge I never paid any mony for the custome of Agga, so it must be for both factoryes, but I told him that I did never read the contract. He answer'd me again that he thought the pallavera over by paying them the custome for putting their small corn into the ground, and farther [they] added they would go to Cabo Corso and gett their ground rent for Agga at 12 angles per month and 6 piezes for Anamaboe. Never a word was ever menconed to me by the Quarenteers, but they are minded to be rogues as they ever were. Yesterday they had been like to have served me so or worse, because I refused to take cracra mony, withall adding that no English men should tarry here, but all their goods they [= the English] should take away and carry it to Ffetu, for that they loved them better than the Ffanteens. Wherein I have occasioned trouble or impeded trade I know not, but they know it as well as I, butt they'r will they'l make their law, and its not so easy a matter as is imagined to perswade them from their own inventions and wills. Pray hasten some lyme and tarras, for if the rains continue shall be at a great streight for want thereof."
1172,2,532,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,17/06/1687,Fort,RAC,"I received yours of yesterdayes date by Assina, and as to what you say that when I paid the Braffo and Quarenteers, I should have told them it was for both factoryes, they knew it was for both as well as I could have told them, for they never made demands for any thing before, and these two that has made all this stirr are slaves or little better to the Quarenteers, for I went as soon as I received your last and acquainted them with Mr Elwes. It was as I have menconed, they are there still and have taken away the ffetish and wait for one of the Quarenteers to come down, who is one that signed to my receipt, and as soone as he comes Ile make him sensible how it is. When your letter arrived yesterday I was there, but as far as I from Mr Elwes do understand, they purpose to begin a new custome, for before a small time of Agent Greenhills departure they rose this custome here and shutt up Mr Thelwall, and would have custome as they had at Cormantine and still have for every shipp that shall arrive at the Mine.
I request those materialls for the Castle I advised for, especially 3 or four hogsheads of lyme and tarras, and Ile send up empty hogsheads in the roome. Pray send down John Tagg with two or three men more in lieu of them I last sent up. Lett one be a smith if possible to make iron work, for it is very much wanted, also an Ardra slave or two, a mason, for ours is dead and is very much need of. The ffactory is much out of repair. This is what needfull at present, and hope you will be pleased to answer my requests.
[PS] I pray spare a stick or two of wax or some wafers."
1173,2,533,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,25/06/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdayes date have received, togather with 40 half ffirkins tallow, allso 3 caske of lime and 1 of tarras, with the iron work menconed in yours.

About a month since at the turning it, the bottom with the moystnesse of the weather was so rotten and caked togather that nigh twenty chests I was forced to throw away, it stinck so much.
PS. Daniell Coopmens being very ill thinks if he were with the Doctor he should recover, therefore at his request I have permitted him to go to Cabo Corso for three or four dayes. I pray send down three or four men, for am now very weakly manned, allso three or four Ardraes more if to be spared."

A slave which I bought this month and another more which belongeth to Captain Heggen [= Eggin] made their escape away from this house by the enticement of some Cabo Corso people, so desire you Gentlemen diligent search and enquiry, for Captain Heggen makes great noise about it. The said slaves were mett this morning betwixt this place and Annishan with a Cabo Corso man, making as I understand their way towards you."
1176,2,536,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,01/07/1687,Fort,RAC,"I wrote you yesterday morning of an accident which happened the other night, and wish could hear news of the slaves, for I am extreamly perplext about the losse, and am threatened hard for large satisfaction for the Cappusheers man. These are allso to acquaint you that yesterday Quashee in the hearing of Mr Whiting, Mr Walker and my self made a great noise and stirr about two cowes, about forty fouls &ca, which he sais Agent Nurse owes him, for which he demands satisfaccon for, and if he pays him not he will pay himself out of the goods which shall come down from Cabo Corso to this place, so begg you to make enquiry of the truth. I have wrote to Agent Nurse about it to be satisfied with speed, that so [sic] no detriment may accrew to the Royall Company for the future. I have wrote you that I wanted more men, I have but three that is capable of doing duty night and day, which they complain is to hard for them to do. Pray spare two or three men more. Likewise pray send two hundred iron barrs, lett them all be marked, for they will take no other here. Have had a very small trade this last month.
[PS] Since the writing of the foregoing I received yours of yesterdays date, taxing me with negligence and want of care in securing the slaves, which I averr they were well secured at night when lockt in the prizon, but they broke an iron barr and crept through into the yard, where there lay an Ardra slave to look after them, and after broke a padlock on one of the doors and gott over the walls where there is a breach by the late excessive rains. Also a white sentinell is every night on the tower all night, and how it should happen that that they should gett away I cannot imagine, unlesse the black sentinells should be consenting to it, so pray a more favorable construction than to imagine me any wayes negligent or carelesse. I have acquainted Mr Whiting with what you wrote me"
1177,2,537,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,04/07/1687,Fort,RAC,"I received yours by the 11 hand canoe, also one hundred and fifty iron barrs and two men. I would gladly know how much each man has a month, against I pay them. I would have sent you up my monthly accompts but have done but two. The ballance allso, which is six mark, four ounces, eight angles, eleven taccoes, shall send with them the first good oppertunity. If any sheets to be spared pray send ten chests, for all I had is gone. Yesterday I was desired to write for powder by Bonashee, but heel [= he'll] give but 13a for 14 barrells, and if that may be sold so then send some."
1178,2,538,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,08/07/1687,Fort,RAC,"I arrived safely about six or seven last night here, and as I enterd the gate the Bendefoes after I was in made outcryes to hinder my entrance, and as I am informed they were ordered by the Cappusheers to do it, and not permitt me to come again into the Castle. The reason I know not, unlesse I would give them all the Royall Companyes concernes. They daily pretend to new customes due to them, and that it has been paid by all my predecessors. I have by their continuall and unjust demands so much drained my whole small stock, and all for my Royall masters interest and safety of their concerns, that I am not able to lanch any fartther in the vast ocean of the unsafe forcible and unsatiable people. They demanded three cases of spiritts, besides half a barrell of powder. If it will or your pleasure is to allow it pray signify it to me. Else my humble peticon is, I candidly present [sic: = request] your judicious consideracons either to order some ffactor you judge most fitting to take charge of this ffactory and the concernes of the Companye or remove me from these diabolicall evill people, and for the removal I shall think myself eternally obliged for your favor, for I am very loath to defraud my masters of a mite, they having been just to me. Pray afford me your resolves with what expedicon may be. I begg excuse, being disturb'd in mind and is the only occasion of this scrawle."
1179,2,539,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,15/07/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 13th I have received, and render hearty thanks for your kind profers and promises, but commiserating my condicon adds nothing to my releif, neither abates the demands of these unjust and unsatisfyable people. Would fair words assuage them I could in some manner appease them, but all the eloquence of Cicero goes not so far as a case of brandy or a cloth. In mine of the 8th I write with unfeigned heart, beseeching and humbly desiring my removall. Likewise do now begg the same with humble peticon to you, and shall think my selfe eternally obliged to you. In what station soever I can be serviceable to my Royall masters interest, I am willing to submitt to your judicious consideracons, for in verity my continuance here will be unprofitable for them, committing it wholly to your mature judgements. Yesterday being on board Captain Gould to take my leave of Agent Nurse, Mr Walker sent me the enclosed note by Quashees son, whom I heard demand payment of Agent Nurse for 3 cowes and 4 sheep &a, which he denyed that ever he had nor would pay anything. What the event will be I cannot saye.
Accordingly as you wrote me I have endeavored to sell barrs at 22 per bendy, but have not sold one nor cannott, which is a great hinderance in the sale of other goods. I could have sold a quantity of barrs at 24, whereas now the Dutch has the mony, so pray your answer.
[PS] Just now the enclosed letter arrived in my hands."
1180,2,540,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,23/07/1687,Fort,RAC,"This accompanyes the canoe that came down yesterday, by which I have sent up two men slaves. One is the fellow I wrote of the last of June broke prison, which with great charge have gott him again. These unreasonable people would not lett me have him unlesse I paid three pieze, which I did and hope it will be allowed of. The prison windowes are so rotten that it is not fitt to hold slaves till have a new one made. I am still perplext with this people. Just now came in three of the Quarenteers to demand knives to cutt their small corn, and will not tarry an hour before they have them, so that I am in the dark of what Mr Nightingale paid the last year, for they will have as many this. God send me well from hence, for my patience is quite worn out with them."
1181,2,541,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,27/07/1687,Fort,RAC,"Whereas on Satterday last, being the 23th of this instant July, the Cappusheers of Anamaboe (I then being Chief there) demanded a case of brandy as an accustomary dashee at their new year as they called it, that is at their cutting of their small corn, which at first I denyed to them, and that I know no such custome and that I would be satisfyed first from you whether it would be allowable, by reason I would give no ill presidents [= precedents] for the time to come, their answer was that if it was not accustomary and allowed of by my predecessors and former Agents and if not by you they would pay for it, and on consideracon of which I did deliver them a case of rume, with which they went out of the gates seemingly well contented. Some small time after they were out of the gate they sent for me to render thanks for the same, and as it was their new year all Chiefs did use to drink with them. Not in the least imagining they had any design or prejudice of ill against me, I did go out. I had not gone six yards from the Castle wall without the gates but presently unsuspectedly a great number of Blacks interveened me and the gate on purpose to hinder mee from returning again, as I since found true. I then went to the Cappusheers, which satt under the wall about 7 or 8 yards farther, they desired me to sitt down, which I did, then they began long storyes, saying that at my going there I promised to be kind to them. I replyed, I never was otherwise. They answered that I would not take cracra mony as others had done before me, and that I would take no pawnes nor trust them, and that the English men were not so kind to them as the Dutch, for that wee [i.e. English] all loved the Fetuers better than the Ffanteeners, and that the Ffetuers were their enemyes, and that they [i.e. the English] might be better aided at Cabo Corso than at Anamaboe, and that I should not tarry there no longer; to which I made this answer, that I had orders not to take their cracra mony, it was so bad, and if I should take it it would occasion more bad mony to be made and brought to me, which I must make good, and that it behooved me to take none but what was good, and what others had done should not be a president for me. I told them likewise that I could not take pawns, knowing that they do not care to redeem them, and that for severall years Mr Thelwall had pawnes from severall of them and that time the Royall Companyes mony lay dead, and so they would do again if I took any pawnes, and as for trusting of them I had to my losse done to much, which I have made good to the Royall Company, and as to the Dutch loving them better than the English, replyed they had more reason for they were ever treacherous to us, as instance their selling Cormantine from us to the Dutch, and as for being more kind to the Fetuers, though their enemyes, [they] were more faithfull ever than they, yett for their mony they might be supplyed as as well as they, for they have nothing without money, and what had I done that should so much incense them to that height. They still persisted in the same story, and that I should not go into the Castle again but I should instantly go to Cabo Corso, and that they would strip me naked and beat me as they had Mr Nightingale, unlesse I would send for an anchor of rume. I well knowing that their cruelty infinitely transcends humane apprehensions, condescended to save myself impunified, and that I might go into the Castle again, which they would not permitt unlesse I left Mr Walker behind me as a pawn and that severall of them might enter with me. This was all done under the Castle walls where no damage could be done to them by any gunns, the fort being so ill contrived and so weakly manned that

they esteemed it invallid. This I humbly offer to your consideracons and will averr to be truth, which is the only reason of my returning to Cabo Corso. Withall that their resolves are that I shall never return to Anamaboe to reside there. To all that is above and within writt, I attest to be nothing but what is truth."
1182,2,542,Ralph Hassell & James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,30/07/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday wee arrived well here. The Cappusheers are all up in the country, so as yett have not had a pallavera, but they have sent for them to acquaint them of our being here and do expect them down tomorrow, and as soon as have done anything shall immediately advise you. Have acquainted Mr Elwes with your desire, who will be here when wee treat with them."
1183,2,543,Ralph Hassell & James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,03/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"As yett wee have not had any discourse with the Cappusheers, they being all up in the country about some grand pallavera and will not come down till they have ended, which as wee understand will be Ffryday next. Till then shall desist from writing unlesse businesse of moment presents."
1184,2,544,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,07/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"This day about two houres since I have had a great discourse and longe debate with the Cabusheers, and the result is they will not again except of Ralph Hassell, he having spoiled the country by his refuseing to take Fanteen cracraes (which is nothing but meere brass), and that he will not trust them, nor take their pawns, that he will not buy noe corne, and that alsoe by his meanes the Factory is not well fortified as it formerly was, which since the great raines it might have been don; would he have sattisfied them to their unresonable demands. Soe we boath desire and request the canoe wee came down in. and att our arrivall shall enlarge farther, soe that you may farther receive better sattisfaction. Soe in the interim begg your excuses"
1185,2,545,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,07/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"This day had a pallavara with the Cabushers, the result of them shall give an accompt at my comeing up. In order thereunto desire you will be pleased to send a canoe for my imbarqument to Caboe Corsoe."
1186,2,546,Ralph Hassell,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,08/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of this date have received, and shall here fully give you the resolution of these Cabusheers, Imprimis that I Ralph Hassell shall noe longer stay here, butt if your pleased to send any other they will except of him, and still continews in the mind I wrote to you before, which Mr Nightingale would not signe, elce it might not have had any impertinency or breach of orders, for I had not his orders butt well know the tennors was to endeavor quiettly to resettle mee if possible and render advise to you of our proceedings imediatly, as I now desired him to doe the same. He utterly denyed signing to any thing, but would goe up himself tomorrow and tell what he had to saye. I desired Mr Walker to heare what he would say, who can attest the same. I demanded and desiared him to signifie with mee to you of what was sayed, he answered he would goe up tomorrow. I replyed it to be a greatt breach of our last orders, he replyed hee did not care. They are desiarous of those men who cannot weell be removed, vizt Mr Whiting or Mr Elwes. They are now growne to such a height that unless speedily suppression this place will not be long tenable, the walls being downe and the Fort out of repare, which makes them soe insolent. I humbly beg your speedy answer, they are much insenste that I stay soe longe, and [I] feare there brooding brains will hatch more mischeife against mee, for Mr Nightingale, if as good or rather bad as his oath, will depart tomorrow early. I humbly begg your pardon if remis in any particular, being written in haste. Pray when the canoe comes downe send some powder, sheets and blew perpetuanoes if any; the sheets all that are good are gon almost, the blew perpetuanoes all but one, and butt six barrells powder left."
1187,2,547,Ralph Hassell ,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,09/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"Since the departure of Mr Nightingale all the Cabusheers of this place have been with a full cry, why did I not goe with him as I came with him. I told them he went contrary to your orders, and that hee could not tarry any longer for want of a doctor, and [they] by noe meanes would not heare of any tarr[y]ing till tomorrow; nor till I could here from you. Daniell Coapeman will tell you the same. They told him likewise he must goe too, butt if I would give them three bottles of brandy, I should tarry till after dinner and not longer, which I did to sattisfie them; and when I goe they will demand more, as I am informed; nay told by them, soe that I am putt to a deale of perplexity by his abruptly goeing away. I doubt must be forced to foot it all the way. I dare not venture to carry the money with mee, which is 5mk and 6ta, but will leave it with Mr Walker. In truth if a speedy course be not taken here, doe believe in a short time noe Factors nor others will be able to abide here. This is the truth; as cann be made apeare, soe in hast to conclude."
1188,2,548,James Walker,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,13/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"By advise of Mr Hassell that it's your command that I should send up an accompt of the stores now remaineing in the foresaid ffortt and signed per selfe, you will find per inclosed it's obeyed. This day has been a greatt difference between Captain Eggin and Boneeshee about a slave of the latters, who has panniard gold and sheepe of a servant belonging to one Ashaw. The deniall of Boneeshee's delivery of the said slave to be prosicuted according to the laws of their country made every Cabusheer his enymy, in soe much that the whole downe [= town] was in armes, many shott past on boath sides, but little damage. Had intilligence that had itt not been for Ahen, whoe gave pawnes for Boneshee that he should comply with their justice, that he and slaves had severely suffered. The pallavara is to be ended tomorrow, and as I am informed, it will cost Boneeshee at least six bendy's, besides charges of soldiers. I have not elce, only that the Cabusheers are yet verry civill and promise the same for the future. As to myself, give you the assurance of my duty in carefullness of the Royall Companyes concernes."
1189,2,549,James Walker,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,21/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"By the 9 hand canoe I received yours, with ten whole barrels of powder, and fifty four gallons of rumme, on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England. Here has been prying [= plying?] to windward a Dutch sloop for some days, which suppose you may take to be Mr Bayly, which if had would have fulfilled your comands, so have thought fitt to returne back your letter to him. I have nothing of moment, only that the Cabusheers are impatient for a new chief, and the more because I am really very poore, and cannot supply their brandy pallate's. I give them faire words, which doth a little assuage their passions, which is only in the morning, when they say their stomacks are cold for want of a dram. They offer no abuse, but continue their visitts every morning. The Arcadians want knives much."
1190,2,550,James Walker,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,22/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"Understanding this afternoone that the Cabusheers designed to morrow morning to go up in the country to rowsaw, and that they would not returne under three weeks, sent to them to desire them to defer for a day or two, till had acquainted you with it, not knowing what buisiness you might have with them, so [they] have promised to stay till Thursday. Do in all submission begg pardon for my omission, in not sending the letter as nominated, which is now certainly inclosed. So waiting your pleasure I take leave."
1191,2,551,James Walker,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,26/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours came to hand about six this evening, and shall send away the messenger tomorrow as sone as daye. The Cabusheers are all here, but had been gon only for a pallavara amoungst themselves. They designed to have went tomorrow, but on sight of yours sent them advise to the contrary."
1192,2,552,Rice Wight,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,31/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday about twelve a clocke wee got downe here, where wee ware welcomed with a sea that broake into our canoe and wett us sufficiently. The Grandees of this place was att Cormantine, but the news of our arivall being carryed to them, made a speedy retturne. Yesterday in the affternoon went to Agga, and inventoryed that ffactory. This morning, wee discours'd the Cabusheers, who were all averse to Mr Hassells continuing in this place any longer, but are very well sattisfied with Mr Nightingall, who they promise to be kind to. Wee are now inventoring this ffactory (and hitherto very calme). Soe soon as finished will retturn and render you an accompt."
1193,2,553,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,09/09/1687,Fort,RAC,"These are to give you an accompt of my saffe arivall and civill reception per natives. Am att present verry buissie with them, soe begg your pardon doe not write you largely, as otherwise would, but shall in two or three dayes time. Have sent by the canoe butts, hogsheads, and caskes twenty."
1194,2,554,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,18/09/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours with accompts yesterday came to hand, and shall according to order transcribe and rectifie. As to the 21 snaphanses gave credditt to the Cabusheers, shall give the Company credditt for in my accompts, so that will not give you occasion of an ill thought. I shall ever make it my study to gain your good opinion. Request your favour, that Mr Hassell may use his indeavours to obtaine of the Cabusheers the corne for the snaphanses, which they promised to pay me, the Mareens son being a pawn for their performance, as Doctor Griffin well knows. Likewise desire to have orders whereby may pay the soldiers, also your pleasure in what wrote concerning the delivery of goods to Mr Cross, and when have all the says, perpetuanoes, tallow &ca to supply me with, there being many Arcanies now here."
1195,2,555,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,21/09/1687,Fort,RAC,"In respect to your orders of the 17th instant have sent you the duplicates of January, February, March, Aprill and May accompts, alsoe three of each for the month[s] of June, July and August, all which belonging to Frederickburge for the yeare 1686/ 7, and hope in all particulars answer a faire and just accompt. My request is that may have your resolves concerning mine of the 18 instant, as to goods that have and may on occasion be delivered Mr Cross. You were pleased to specifie in your last the coming downe of the slaves, which I have not seen, soe thought good to advise you thereof, imagining that they may not follow your commands.
Just now received a letter from Mr Pepperell directed to you, which you will now receive. Jeremiah Mitchell is a very drunken ffelow, and not fitt to be imployed in any buisiness, he, as I am informed, being the only occation of the canoe's being staved. I shall say noe more butt that he is whatever I know him a fellow not to be intrusted. Here has been for some time a Dutch interloper, on board which all Cabushiers and traders resort, soe that wee have had noe trade this severall dayes, neither can expect, as long as they heare of any shipps to windward or leeward, which [is] to say between Succondee and Winneba. Mr Cross is and has been ill this three or four dayes. Desire your favor for instructions for the payment of the soldiers as now they are."
1196,2,556,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,23/09/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 22th instant received, wherein you are pleased to say the sending goods from one place to the other it never did any good but occasioned trouble, and for my part I am very well satisfied with your order, which by me at all times shall be observed, but pray ley me tell you since goods was sent hither in my absence, I thought it my duty to acquaint you of it, that I might have Mr Cross his receipts for what have been delivered, or the goods restored, and Gentlemen I do not at all question but that you will supply us both when occasion shall present. You were on my departure pleased to order three men and two women slaves with William the Carpenter in order of repairing what is fallen downe, and without a black carpenter and mason, it cannot be don. For my part I do my indeavour.
When Ando Bonashee comes downe with the Cabusheirs which are in the country will do my indeavour to purchase what corne you were pleased to order. I shall not neglect to procure wood for Agent Bradley, and could wish that I was capable in serving him more, which shall be my study to endeavour it
Pray lett me have a coppy of Mr Hassells accompt as touching your payment of the soldiers. At the rate here some have more, some less in sallary, and without  cannot make an accompt up right. Here is no trade at all, the gold is gon aboard the Mary, and as you know as long as any shipps to windward the Annamaboe and Agga people are there."
1197,2,557,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,27/09/1687,Fort,RAC,"This accompanyes Herbert Curry and is to informe you that I have dayly complaints against him by the Cabusheers and people of this place, and is as I understand through liquors and other comodityes which he sells them, and trusting them for it, and in demanding of his debt. They are so unjust as not to pay him, but according to their ways do prendee him for demanding of his right, which in short they are not willing to [allow?] any white man. I have not anything to alledge against him as to the performance of his duty, or civil deportment, only that if he should remayne here, it would be a continuall trouble, in making up the differences which may happen, therefore humbly requesting the ffavour, that there may be no occasion, and as to the men when you have them, and supplyed, desire your consideration as to this place. Pray let me have a bill of rates for goods, and coppy of Mr Hassells accompt as to the payment of the soldiers. So begging your pardon for this trouble, which I cannot avoyd."
1198,2,558,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,29/09/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday I gave Mr Walker orders to pay the soldiers their sallary in good gold. The only exceptious persons were John Pound and Herbert Curry, whom Mr Walker on the refusall of the gold brought before mee, with the gold. I told them that in my judgement it were verry good, and that if they would depend on their owne opinion before mine, wee would be tryed by neither, but that they should take the said gold sealed up and goe to Caboe Corsoe, and soe refer to your better judgements, but Curry refused the thing and tooke the gold, the other continued obstinate, and giving mee very absurd language, saying that his covenants with the Royall Company is not fulfilled, and if all men were of his opinion they would lay downe their armes, and lett the Company come here and keep their fforts theirselves, for they have putt a cheat upon men, and if occasion should serve, he would serve them accordingly. The gold which denyed have now sent up, and is the same Mr Walker gave him, haveing sealed these in the presence of most here. Thought not convenient to trouble you with sending him up, have put him in the hole and there shall continue till your further commands. Requesting your favors that there may be some course taken and that there may be noe incouragement for such mutinous fellows, whoe is not to be doubted, if opportunity served, would betray a ffort. Pray take itt not ill, for itt is realy my thoughts. And your great civillity to Herbert Curry, which he has made his boast of, makes the others more presumtive, and if had a Serjant would ocesion less trouble, and if you approve of Hastings Ingram, who I find to be a sober man, shall by your order make him Serjant, which may be well in keeping better commands and orders."
1199,2,559,James Walker,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,02/10/1687,Fort,RAC,"My humble requests and intreaties are, as there is a vacancie of a seconds place at Accraa, that you will be pleased to lay your comands on me to officieate in the same, and I shall with all diligence and faithfully indeavour to give that satisfaction as may be required, and shall ever acknowledge your great favor in that and others."

Have alsoe made an end of [sic] with Mr James Walker from primo to ultimo. The reason I have not sent my accompts is occasioned per multiplicity of buisiness in sorting the damaged goods from the good, in order of the purchaseing of corne for the same if possible, and bring the Cabusheers to 1a12<math id=""actrade-9780197262528-math-36"" display=""inline"">

I send per Peter the sum of two marks, three angles and five taccoes of good gold, being the ballance of Ffredrickburgh August accompt, also my September accompt at Annamaboe with the ballance, being two ounces, tenn angles, and ffour taccoee's. There having been soe many Dutch interlopers, is the occasion we have noe trade. Ffour ships at a time has been in the roade, besides Thomas Towers.
Gentlemen you will find the dashees given for settling and the liberty for rebuilding this ffactory has been only in brandy and rumme, which formerly was in says, perpetuanoes and other goods. Have after some trouble a grant to receive the Companys gunn, which Mr Hassell gave the Cabusheers, and tomorrow will send for it. A ffactory is better once well settled than troublesome dayly, and doe ashure you it has not cost mee little liquor.
Have sent John Teage with four iron barrs, in order that if you please the smith may make what is wanting. Ditto Teage has the dimentions of each. Here is hardly a window that will hang on thier hinges, being all rotten, therefore pray let mee have some deale boards, or elce be pleased to order the carpenter to make windows at Cabo Corso, some coming per this canoe."

In answer to what you write, I once more dow solemly protest before the Allmighty God, that I never saw the man you write for, only as formerly by mine the 22d instant, twas by desire of Captain Coffee, and lett him be who he will that hath told you to the contrary, has told abominable untruth, for have never had the man in my custody, as have made appeare in the presence of the whole garrison, and Mr Elwes boy by name Eggin, and that before Captain Coffees face, as per a letter written to Mr Elwes to that purpose. I have proffered a great deale to procure the man, which is at Anisham, in order that you may know the truth, and more then that as soon as I can procure, Captain Coffee will secure him till your [= you are] sattisfied. As to the Royall Companys concernes to make up my accompts, pay the ballance and come up my self, shall be observed, or what elce in soe, [you] will be pleased to command me."

Gentlemen you will be pleased to excuse my coming to Cabo Corso, its not disobeying your commands, but in reallity as followeth.
In the first place I am not well in health. Secondly the natives here are all in armes, and our ffort wall is not above four foot high and some places downe. I have ever since my being here, as per your order of the 8th September to put the ffort in as good a repaire as possible, I have don my endeavors and have compleated 34<math id=""actrade-9780197262528-math-37"" display=""inline"">

</math> of the wall, and that 14 ffoot high. Chancellor and others plainly tells me that when they please they can take our ffort, which troubles mee dayly to heare. Therefore pray if possible lett me have some white men, alsoe four men, two weomen slaves, only for 14 days, in order to gett the wall up, for intend towards the watter side to make the gate, which is more secure. You would admire what trouble and charge dayly I am at to keep the Companyes ffort and concernes in good being, which doubt not as long as I am here shall be keept soe.
I am forced to send this by a two hand canoe, by reason there is noe passage by land, in which canoe pray send the windows, nailes and what elce was ordered for this place. Want also some lime and a caske of tarris for the tank, which is quite out of repaire, and some sheet lead for the gutters, and when your leasure will permitt pray send me some says, and a baile of the redd Guynea stuffs, all on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England. Last night came here ambassador[s] from Ffetue about settling Ahen, but he refused there propositions. Intends with Fantene people to fight Ffetue about 8 or 10 days hence, and to that intent Captain Eggin, who is Generall, with the Cabusheers goes to the Braffoe and Coranteers to gett their people in readiness as well as here. When I hear the certainty more of the thing, will advise."
1207,2,567,Thomas Johnson,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,09/11/1687,Fort,RAC,"This accompanies Mr Nightingale, in the 7 hand canoe. Upon the receipt of yours [he] received me kindly, and this morning hath locked up the warehouse, and will not seale it. He hath brought the key with him, and left in possession [myself]."
1208,2,568,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,18/11/1687,Fort,RAC,"I humbly desire you would be pleased to send me per first on accompt Royall Affrican Company ten chests of sheets, and one case of says. All is well here."
1209,2,569,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,22/11/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 21th instant received, and am thankfull in sending Doctor Wolber, for severall men here are troubled with Guinea distempers. Shall use him according as shall meritt, I being sensible he was sent out by the Royall Company. Am very well satisfied, if you had the goods write for, you would have sent them. The gold came to me first, but I having none, sent them to Mr Cross with the gold. Its all one where the Company takes there gold, yet a great difference in the charge of each Factory.
Shall purchase what corne you are pleased to order at the price mentioned. Also have on receipt of yours sent John Teague to Annishan, to keep the Royall Company possession at that place, and will with the assistance of the natives, hinder the French landing or coming ashore, if should attempt it. Have paid John Pound his sallary and canky money and took his receipt, and per this canoe comes up, he and John Todd."
1210,2,570,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,23/11/1687,Fort,RAC,"This accompanyes James Cunduit, which sent to give you an accompt what is wanting to repaire the canoe at Amersa. I understand the people at Annishan
begins to play the rogue, which sent John Teague away yesterday, but sent him back againe, after I had discoursed with Coffee. I as yett heare nothing. This morning when doe, will give an accompt per express."
1211,2,571,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,24/11/1687,Fort,RAC,"Since my last per James Cunduit, came here the Cabushiers from Annishan, with Captain Coffie, who told me that they were ordered per the Quarrantiers, and the Cabushier of Caesuckam, to tell me that without you send a white man with the Royall Company goods to reside there, as formerly, they would dispose of the Royall Companys interest and gunns at Annishan. They desire your answer per first, what you intend to do, and if not come suddenly, they will turne the white man away, and go on board the Ffrench shipp to effect their designs. I desire you would be pleased to order me, or who you shall please to appoint, what you please to do in the thing. In short they are rogues, and want but an oppertunity. This is in short the reall truth, which is my duty to advise timely. Pray send some white men if possible, I having no more than four that are good, and if can, pray let one be a carpenter to mend the guns carriages. Really wee are very week here."
1212,2,572,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,01/12/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 26th past have received, and have done my endeavours according to your orders concerning Annishan. Have sent Herbert Currey instead of John Teague, he being more sober. The Cabushiers and Quarranteers are still for goods and without the same, say they will certainly dispose off the Royall Companyes intrest at that place, and Gentlemen they are not to be trusted. They have sent to Mr Du Cass to the effect.
I humbly desire you will be pleased to send on account [of the] Royall African Company of England, some powder, perpetuanoes, sheets, says, rum, and palme oyle. For want of the same Mr Crosse tooke gold for his this morning, coming to me first, and there is a greate deale of difference in the charges of each Factory, which pray please to consider. In a day or two will send my monthly accoounts."
1213,2,573,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,04/12/1687,Fort,RAC,"Both yours dated the 3d instant received, with 25 perpetuanoes blew, 25 ditto green, 390 sheets, six barrells of powder, and 165 gallons of rum, foure white men, all on account of the Royall African Company, for which said goods will give them credditt accordingly.
Yesterday before the first letter came to hand saw a shipp come to an anchor at Annishan, the natives telling me it was Captain Emanuel Burdis. I seeing the boate goeing ashoare, sent imeadiately Hansicoe to see what newes there, but coming told me there were French men, whereupon ordered all Annamaboe people to come to armes, and goe along with me to Annishan, but before gott thither, received the letter, which came in good time. The Cabushiers of Annishan understanding our coming sent the French men all away with their boate. I went with all Annamaboe people in the Factory and ordered the soldiers to ffire three vollues under the Royall Companys fflagg in deffiance of any French to settle there, although they have liberty of Annishan people.
But in short the thing is thus, that with much adoe have gott a promise, with condition the Royall Company, or you Gentlemen in their behalfes, will send goods and rebuild [ms. 'rubuild'] the Factory, noe nation whatsoever shall settle there, and without that they are resolved to dispose off Annishan to the French, having already been conditioning about it, but where [= were] at present hindred, understanding my coming there. They say they will stay for your answeare till Munday night or Tuesday morning and noe longer, and with much adoe gott that promise of them, and in reallity, if not send goods and resettle your intrest will be lost. This is the reall truth and my duty to advise timely, therefore desire your order against the appointed time.
Inclosed comes my November accounts with the ballance, being two ounces, two angles and eight taccooes. The two duplicates will send per first. I humbly desire youl be pleased that I may purchase corne for all the damaged goods, for now is the time, before ships come downe.
Pray be so kind as to to send some musquetts, swoards and bandeliers for our white men, a halbert, and a carpenter for six dayes to mend the gun carriages."
1214,2,574,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,05/12/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date last night I received, and this morning early sent for Captain Coffee and the Cabushiers from Annishan, and fully discoursed them, in what relates to the Royall Companys intrest and affaires in that place. They are very well satisfied with your resolution in not suffering the French to settle, since you have promised to doe it yourselves, but by all meanes send downe some goods to morrow before the Curranteers comes, for I feare elce these rogues will fall from their words, for they doe as good as tell me soe. There is a house ready for the reception of the goods. In the interim shall take what care I can till your further order.
[PS] Captain Coffee tells me that the Dutch sent him word that if wee did not settle at Annishan they would, before the French should have it. I sent them word that wee was as able to doe it as they, and that wee had done it already."
1215,2,575,James Nightingale & William Cross,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,07/12/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 6th instant have received, and this morning Captain Coffee and the Cabushiers have been with us, and they have agreed to send up a mann tomorrow to treate with you about the affairs of Annishan, at Cabo Corso Castle. I have sent there according to order some goods, and lay'd before them what you have mentioned in your severall letters, with which they seeme very well satisfied."
1216,2,576,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,08/12/1687,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys one of the Cabushiers according to order of the 6th instant. The French shipp sayled yesterday to leeward. I sent to Annishan five blew perpetuanoes, five ditto green, ten course sletias, and thirty two Guynea stuffs, all good goods."
1217,2,577,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,09/12/1687,Fort,RAC,"Captain Coffee with the Cabushiers of Annishan are here, and tells me that the Braffo of Consockum has ordered that [if] you doe not send more goods and a white man at Annishan, they will send yours away.
I am credibly informed that the French are about setling at Tantan Querry, Ladjue, Winibo and Barricoe, all belonging to the Royall Company. Soe Gentlemen you know best what to doe in this thing. Here are five greate ships in sight about Amersa but as yett know not what they are, when doe will advise. I desire you will be pleased to send me back the list of the three French ships, which comes inclosed. Our sloope is in the roade, but the Master is not yett come ashoare. Our Cabushiers begin their old tricks, with much adoe I can keepe them in quietness. All things are well, God be praised, at both the Factoryes.
[PS] The shipps in sight are Frenchmen. In hast."
1218,2,578,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,11/12/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 9th instant received, and have told Captain Coffee and the Cabushiers of Annishan what you ordered me. The Currantyer is not yett come downe.
The French went ashoare at Amersa with the flagg and flagg stafe, in order off their setling. I sent imeadiatly some rum to the Cheife there to hinder their designe, yett thaye have in cognito sent to the Currantyers and Braffo of that place to settle there, and their cheife article they stand upon, is not to suffer any nation to purchase oyster shells but themselves, yett their flagg is gone aboard againe.
Inclosed is a letter from Mr Whiteing at Accraa, who desired me to send forward per express."
1219,2,579,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,12/12/1687,Fort,RAC,"This accompanyes the Mate of Captain Simon Shears, who will give you account of their affaires.
Likewise is come ashoare one Captain Joseph Andrewes, Comander of one of the Royall Companys shipps bound for Old Callabar. The French are still at Amersa."
1220,2,580,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,14/12/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 12th instant have received, and had before that time put on board the Mary 100 sticks of wood from Annishan on Agent Bradlys account, also 150 ditto on account of the Royall African Company at Annamaboe, as per receipt at the months end will appeare. Will undoubtedly observe the motion of the French, and hinder if possible their setling at Amersa. The reason was Captain James stayd yesterday, because his long boate fetcht water. Have sent on the Royall Companyes account 18 pewter juggs."
1221,2,581,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,17/12/1687,Fort,RAC,"This is to advise you that the sloope is departed from Amersa with 60 butts of oystershells, and have hindred the French of setling there, per the Braffo, Eggin and upland people, although the Quarrantier of Annishan put it on ffoote, as likewise his son Gauguning at Winaboe. Since the Mary departed from hence
am informed that about Tanton Querry she mett with a French man of warr, and there past severall guns between them at night and the next day day, hope it may prove salutes. Have the same information from Amersa.
Pray be pleased to sent on account Royall Company some sletias course, lead barrs, tallow in halfes firkins good pewter juggs, one pound pewter basons, with some lime and tarris. Captain Coffee sent to me the Companyes stick to know if it was your order. I sent word whatever he did he should waite on you imeadiately, and obey order."

Have likewise received six cattouch boxes, and doubt not when occasions present but that you will furnish me with lime and tarris, which is realy much wanted for our tank. Captain Cowley is dispatcht from hence with his corne and wood. I will send Mr Cross tomorrow my canoe, canoe men and slaves for dispatch of Captain Cowley."

I can expect noe trade here, there being two Factoryes supplyed with goods, one to windward and another to leeward of me, yett I between both am at the charge, by comers and goers in drinking of brandy, and in reality have been at a more charge to the natives of Annishan, Amersa, and upland people. Mr Cross can give an account as have charged in my accounts.
The two hundred chest of corne have delivered to Captain Cowley, but tooke noe receipt, and he goeing away suddenly, have not gott the receipt for the wood, yett have sent an attestation for your better satisfaction."

He is soe greate with the natives that should he continue here long, upon a fair oppertunity I verily beleeve he would betray the Fort. This is what wee can say at present, only upon the first conveiniencie shall use our endeavours to execute your commands."
1228,2,588,James Nightingale & William Cross,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,01/02/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours Ultimo January have received, and are sorry that wee gave you an occasion of offence, and that you should thinke wee dare presume to disobey your orders, for if you are pleased to peruse againe what wee wrote before, you will find our proposalls are as much for the advantage for the Royall African Companyes intrest, as your jealousie is to the contrary, for that and the security of this place is onely what wee designed. Gentlemen, wee are troubled that you should tell us of a joynt confederacy with Doctor Woolber. What you have writt upon suposition will be thought reall when it comes to the African House, soe pardon us if wee justifie ourselves, for farr be it from either of us to have any such thoughts as to be concerned with him, or any body elce, in things of that nature, and soe wee hope you will interpret it. Last night wee tooke our oppertunity, and have seized upon all Doctor Woolbers bookes and papers, and safely sealed them up, and by this conveyance sent them to you. He had not the least suspicion of our intentions, soe certainely nothing was conveyed away, onely wish this had been done the night before, but knowing you to be as good as greate, hope you will be pleased to excuse us this time, and then lett come what will come, wee shall most readily execute your comands."
1229,2,589,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,06/02/1688,Fort,RAC,"I send my January account per bearer with the ballance of the same, being one marke, two ounces, thirteen angles and nine taccooes in gold. The traders were afraid to come, here occasioned by dayly pallavering concerning Ahen, which is the reason they went to Agga. I have sent to the Arcanys to procure the same at this place, and some of their merchants are come here. I doubt not but shall have a good trade in a little time, the merchants shall not want encouragement.
Pray be pleased to send me on account of the Royall African Company a quantity of blew and green perpetuanoes, says Guyny stuffs, sheets if you can spare them or be at Cabo Corsoe."
1230,2,590,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,09/02/1688,Fort,RAC,"I gave you an account of the 6th instant that I had brought the Arcanie merchants downe hither, therefore pray send me some goods formerly writt for, or as many as you can spare of them.

1231,2,591,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,15/02/1688,Fort,RAC,"Just now received per express this inclosed letter from Mr Whiting, who writes me that the inclosed is of greate matters of concernes relating to the Royall Companys affaires.
Both your last letters shall answeare per first, being this morning beusy in putting corne aboard of Captain Batherne."
1232,2,592,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,16/02/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 10th and 14th instant have received. Your orders not to dispose of iron barrs for corne shall be observed, but please to understand that a greate many of them are the remaines before Mr Thelwalls time, as per publique inventory taken, and are most eaten up with rust. Concerning the remaines in my last monthly account [they] are realy true, and it hath been my method and shall be to keep my accounts and the warehouse to agree, and hope you have not found it hitherto to the contrary, and Gentlemen I cannot help that there is noe more gold returned, the charge being soe greate both in payments of soldiers, slaves and other concernes for the Royall Company, which my neighbouring Factors are not concerned withall, which occasions soe small a returne, which pray be pleased to consider, and if you be pleased to conjecture what dayly trouble I am at here with these people [it] would tyer a mans heart out.
I have already delivered on board Captain Bathernes shipp 92 chests of good corne, as per his receipts will appeare. Shall purchase for the Royall Company 300 chests ordered, as soone as possible. Have sent per bearer five ounces of gold belonging to the estate of Mr Walker, and would have done it before if have had your order, which now I see is sufficient, but noe other single person which first demanded it [was sufficient]. Just now arrived a letter from Captain Vagoner, who advices me that Mr Fensmen at Accra ordered him to sayle upon receipt to ditto place, being also desired by the Generall of the Mina."
1233,2,593,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,18/02/1688,Fort,RAC,"This comes per express to give you an accompt that last night Ahen and all Fanteen people are gon to Saboe, to joyn with the King of ditto place, with an absolute resolution to fight Fetue. Eggin comands as chief, and its thought they are very strongh, and tells me 5400 men, besides the traine. In short there is not a Cabushier or a man left that is able to carry arms. The Generall of the Mina is very buissy in the concernes. Pray send me some slaves, what are here are sick, and are continually running away, since they see the former are not yet returned. I have but one man, one woman, which are not able to keep the Castle with wood for our people. I likewise begg a coppy of your orders at your gates of Cabo Corso, that I may accordingly keep our people with their order to their duty. Am much troubled with them, playing the rogue dayly, from the highest to the lowest, and do what they please. Pray excuse my writing, am somewhat sickly."
1234,2,594,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,23/02/1688,Fort,RAC,"This morning I received a letter from Mr Whiting with the inclosed, and also another from Captain Waggoner, who intends to sayle for Europe in few days, therefore pray send your letters with all speed, and be pleased to lett the canoe call in here, because I would send a letter to my father, having received one from him per the last Dutch shipp. This being sent per express, there being no passage by land. The Braffoe of Fanteen hath been dead this six days, and Captain Eggin will succeed him. They will not let the vulgar people know it untill Ahen's designe is effected. Pray send me what I desired in my last letter."
1235,2,595,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,28/02/1688,Fort,RAC,"I send per bearer my monthly account with the ballance of the same, being the sum of mk2=5=12=7. You will perceive per ditto account what currant goods are wanting, which if you please to send, the Royall Company shall have credditt for them accordingly. Pray Gentlemen send me a Black carpenter and a mason for 10 days, with some nailes and small staples for doores and windows, also 3 hogsheads of lyme, and 2 ditto of tarris, to repayre the flanker, platforme and tanke, for they are all crackt in severall places, insoemuch that I am afrayd they will tumble downe without a sudden repayre, wee having had here a great deale of rayne. Also be pleased to grant me the slaves which you were pleased to promise, at my being at Cabo Corso, and humbly begg a coppy of your orders at the gate of Cabo Corso, in order to keep our people, upon their duty. In reality if I should fall sick, here are so many comanders, that it would occasion a great deale of trouble and ill conveniency at this place. Shall not insist any further on this particular, but hope to keep that good comand you have been pleased to give, with all civility imaginable, as hope you have not heard to the contrary."
1236,2,596,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,03/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 29th February and accounts received, with an order to rectifie the same. Gentlemen be pleased to consider what people I have to deale withall, that never did nor will keep their promises nor words, but to the contrary impose new burthens upon him that is most kind to them, and they thinke it is because he dare not do otherwise to them, for there hath been formerly so much granted by my predecessors that scarce any thing can safely be denied, which pray be pleased to consider. I do assure you if had not pay'd for the building of the wall, which is effected, it would have occasioned a great deale of charge and trouble more than it hath don. And if I should give you an account of all transactions wee are under here, it would be endeless to write, and put Mr Boylston to a great deale of trouble, and litle satisfaction. As to the iron barr and one sheet [it] hath been really disbursed for Factorys use, and for the halfe barrell of powder and eight gallons of rum, [it] is really paid to Fanteen army. It hath cost me one anchor of brandy, four lead barrs and a half barrel of powder and other necessaryes on my own particular account, and yet they are not contented. Concerning the canoe, I do protest before God it did never belong to me, but on the contrary to a Negroe, by name Dominee. And Gentlemen since I have been on the Coast, what a Factor really could make appeare to have disbursed on Companyes account, as I have don, has been allowed, which humbly begg you will be pleased to grant me, and to consider in what place I am, where neither is satisfaction for the Master, but on the contrary intolerable dayly affords and charges to their servants. Do not presume to insist upon old methods, but on the contrary leave my self wholly and solely to your discretion, and humbly begg you will be pleased to consider and allow the aforementioned charges, being really disbursed on Company account as is before mentioned."
1237,2,597,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,03/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 3d instant received. Shall only say that I send my February accounts rectified according to order, also the ballance of the same, being three markes, eight angles and seaven taccoes. The carpenter wants two of the biggest sparrs for the hall at Annamaboe, or elce all will tumble downe, a hand screw, one hundred tenn penny nailes and two hundred smaller in sorts, for the doores, windows and hinges. The great canoe is here from Accra. The canoemen being weary cannot padle against the wind but will be at Cabo Corso in the morning. Clements has given me the letters, which comes inclosed. Pray send the slave back, here is not one man slave in the Castle."
1238,2,598,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,08/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 7th instant with two sparrs and one hogsheadd of tarris and a hand screw have received, and alsoe the two men slaves which formerly run away, for which I thanke you.
Per returne of the 9 hand canoe comes up Doctor Wolber according to orders, who is a very troublesome fellow and puts more confidence in a Black man then in a White, and hath had of late with them severall ganglins [= janglings] and quarrells continually to and fro about the Castle, that it makes me very uneasey, and indeed am not fond of his company, without you will be pleased to give such orders that he may keep himselfe in that station that he is in and not to keepe any correspondencies with any Black here at Annamaboe. He hath trusted them with much goods and monyes, which they now have cheated him of, which is the occasion of the continuall dispute.
Docter Walber tells me that his agreement was with the Company for fifty pounds per anno for his diett, as he will showe you per his papers at Cabo Corsoe Castle, which you have been pleased likewise formerly to allow him at Accra and alsoe here at Annamaboe.
I humbly desire you will be pleased to send on account of the Royall African Company of England vizt sayes, sheets, perpetuanoes, blew and green, iron barrs, for what is remaining here is the very refuge [= refuse] of what was left in Mr Thelwalls time. I shall likewise want (when your keele [= kill] is burnt) three hogsheads of lime and some bricks and more tarris, and a bricklayer, ffor the fflanker doth crack in severall places, and the tanck and plattforme is much out of repaire.
[PS] The duplicates of February accounts shall be sent per first."
1239,2,599,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,15/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"The carpenter being here wants 100 6 penny and 100 2 penny nailes more [for] Factoryes use. Likewise I desire you would be pleased to let the carpenter stay here till Saturday, in order to mend the canoe which carryed oystershells, for here is no[t] a canoe to be gott, if shipps should be order[d] downe for corne."
1240,2,600,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,17/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 14th & 16th instant received. In answer to the 1st is that I have delivered to Captain Buttram his complement of as good corne as ever was shipt aboard. Am likewise satisfied in your orders concerning Doctor Wolbers dyett, for which I shall give the Company credditt in this months accompt. The next morning after the receipt of yours, sent Mr Johnson to Captain Eggin, and to the Cabushiers up in the countrey, in order to provide some corne. They understanding that there are many ships on the Coast, do pretend that corne is both very deare and and scarce, so I can give you no certainty. In short could not purchase one chest since my last remaynes. I understand that they do designe to raise it to two angles a chest, and to be payd in good says. Notwithstanding shall follow your former orders, with what goods I have if possible. Have sent likewise the Generall of the Minas letter (in your inclosed) to Mr Everaas upon the receipt. Wee are ready to assist Captain Buttram with six good guns, if occasion shall require. The Companyes money, and his owne, is at present in the warehouse. Here are severall soldiers sick and lame. Be pleased to order Doctor Mackdowall to send some bresilicum and plastering, Doctor Wolber has lockt up all his things, and has left no plasters for the men.
[PS] Pray be pleased to send me some paper, for indeed this is the last sheet."
1241,2,601,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,19/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"By report of the Negroes the French shipp hath received advice of the gold being put ashore, and that Captain Buttram hath assistance of men, was the occasion of preventing their fighting, which otherwise might have been expected. The French shipp at this interim past by without showing any colours. I shall send a messenger on board the Portuguez, to get a further account of the Ffrench man, and shall advise you if needfull. Pray be pleased to order what shall don with the gold chest, whether it shall be delivered on board Captain Buttram or sent up to Cabo Corso. Pray be pleased to send me some paper, for indeed I have nothing to write upon."
1242,2,602,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,20/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"This accompanies Nathan Pile, whom sent up to you. Pray be pleased to send some lyme, and tarris, and if you can a bricklayer, for the flankers and walls are very much out of repayre, as per an account at large you shall have of the bearer."
1243,2,603,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,25/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 24th instant have received, and Ile assure you the last monthly remaynes is true. The reason of not present delivery to Captain Buttram his complement of corne, is that by reason of great quantityes of corne lying togather I thought it fitt to order the corne to be kept in its teers [= tiers], for the better preservation of it from buggs and weavels. The ware [ = war] coming on, it cannot presently be brought in. I sent my second up to that purpose for the forwarding it home, which is as sure as as if it were in the warehouse (only for the present). I am now dispatching Captain Buttram. I do not want corne for him, although I did instant to his mate of what you write. Understanding by him, that the Captain is very well provided with beans and other Negroe provitions, therefore for the surety and sooner dispach of other shipps, proposed it to him. For the better dispatch of Captain Sturt, pray be pleased to order him to take the rest of his corne in at Agga, of Mr Cross. In the interim shall forward home the rest of the corne, which is dayly coming. You yourselves know that no Black is punctuall to his word to a day or teen [= ten]. That and the ware hath been the principall reason of my not being ready. There is nothing of what is aforementioned, or other cases, but that I have at all times acted the Companyes best interest, which never shall be wanted in me.
If chance I shall be disapointed in which I have don for the good of the corne, I have money ready to purchase corne, therefore pray be not offended for the present disapointment, be assured that shall be ready in a very short time."
1244,2,604,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,26/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"Captain Buttram being dispatch yesterday by nine of the clock with his corne, I ordered Hukamee to returne to Cabo Corso with his canoe. At his being here, he continually idles away his time, and no persuading him to returne, staying here expecting Captain Buttrams dashey, and being continually up in the towne, am afraid of some ill to attend him and the rest of the canoemen, having enough to do to keep them in peace. Shall endeavour to dispatch Captain Sturt as soon as possible, the sea being very high. Hope he shall want litle of his complement, if any at all, the rest shall be brought in with all speed possible in the Factory. There shall be nothing wanting in me."
1245,2,605,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,27/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"This is to give you an account that I have ship't on board the shipp Expedition, Captain Sturt Comander, one hundred sixty three chests of very good corne, as per the inclosed doth appeare. There shall be no neglect in me to gett the rest in (which is in teers) as soon as possible. All the people being in the countrey is the onely hinderance to get it in so suddenly. This night all the men were forced out of the towne to the army, only some few fishermen. Gentlemen at the decease of the Braffo of this countrey have been forced (otherwise could not live in quietness) to give towards his funerall these goods on account of the Company, vizt one brawle, two sheets, one damaged allejar, one quarter barrell of powder, and eight gallons of rum, which I hope you will be pleased to allow in this months account, having really paid the same.
[PS] The other inclosed will show that Captain Buttram is also fully satisfied, although his huffing mate writt otherwise, and put you to a misunderstanding of me, and am sorry that you are so continuall misinformed of me, which always proves to the contrary."
1246,2,606,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,31/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 28th instant received, and observe what you allow for the Braffo's funerall, which shall charge accordingly.
As to Doctor Wolber, in short he is more a beast than a Christian, and has so many tricks that he is able to set up all by the ears, and ruine all the Royall Companys concernes here, or any where elce, without he be kept under, and if you Gentlemen did but see the hundredth part of his moross and unbecoming actions, you would not blame me, nor any in that station you were pleased to put me in, to keep him under a good and lawfull comand, as hitherto have don, and Gentlemen you yourselves are sensible of his tricks at Cabo Corso, Accra, aboard the Mary, and since his last coming downe. Had like to bring a great difference between Mr Everars and my selfe per his reports, which after a strict examination found to be falce, before all our garrison. I am afrayd that one time or another he will occasion great trouble per the Blacks, if not betray the ffort. Have not received any corne, all the people are with Captain Eggin and [= at] Saboe. I intend to go there tomorrow, in order to have corne brought downe as soon as possible, I find that sending of others signified nothing. I humbly begg you will be pleased to have patience till I can get it in. If the people were downe could soon be supplyed with a great deale of ease, which hope you will be pleased to grant. Should without writing let Mr Cross have the 5 hand canoe, for wee always let one another have what wee want. Have sent Dr Wolber this morning to Agga, The old Gentleman there is very sick."
1247,2,607,James Nightingale,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,02/04/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours of this date have received.

I have sent per Mr Ronan my accompt to the primo Aprill, which was in the warehouse before wee tooke an inventory, but for the better satisfaction, have made two accompts beginning ultimo March and ending 4th Aprill, which agrees with the remaynes at this Factory, only the corne, which shall be in the Factory within 6 or 8 days. I have been yesterday in the countrey in order to have it brought downe. The rest leave to the personall discourse of Mr Ronan."

The said canoman has promised us ffaithfully he will come up to Cabo Corso, to declare the truth of the matter. He likewise informed us that when they put off Mr Blinsham fell backward in the cano.

Their answer was that unless they should be paid as formerly they have been, they will not goe out of the factory but remain where they are, and doe impute it to my fault, that they have not already received it. I desire your Worship would be so kind as to allow it in my time as before, and as you writ they have received sufficient dashes already, they say what was given them before my time was not on account of Christmas, and as itt being customary are resolved they will not loose it, and their demands being so great cannot on my own account allow it, soe desire will consider the dayly troble they put me to.

Corn is very plenty, but here not being people to bring it canot in a small time expect to procure any quantity without the warrs sease and their people to return, of which there is no likelyhood, the Anguinas being resolved to break a free passage of trade and come on the intent nearer and nearer upon the Fanteen. As yet they have had no settle [= set] battle. What corn we buy is most for lead barrs, and doe take in aboute 8 or 10 chests a day. At that rartes [= rates] we may be procurd corn, so that the utmost may be expected to take in by me canot be more than three hundred chests in any small time. Yesterday went away the East India Merchant. Not any trade stirring."

Severall of these received last were very much damnified. Since my last have not received more than twelve chests corn. As it comes in shall not be backward in advising. Last night came down a small English interloper and lyes between Annamaboe and Agga, and his cheife of of his loading is sugar and rum, some allejars and broad nicconees. He tarrys here to take in fourty chests of corn and on that intent he sent yesterday for Yabboy aboard,
who I beleive will endeavour to supply him. As to the warrs they have made no proceedings but lyes in readiness, expecting the enimys approachment."

Informed you in my last what quantity of corn had by me and taken, since have in no more than six chests, so that in all that I have is one hundred and sixty chests of corn. But little discourse concerning the warrs, the Cabusheers remayne al up at Fanteen and have sent word down that in case they fight not in 5 dayes, that then they must tarry a month longer for a bondee. Severall of my sattins received last month were damnified, mentioned them in per my last [by] mistake [as] flowered silk."

The Captain of the Arcanies is some time since come down and has been with me severall times to know what should be allowd him as

Here is no more corn to be procured without your Worship will allow two angles per chest, they haveing by reason of their warrs lost great part of their rowsaing time, and are also resolved to war with the Fettues, so that they will keep their corn for fear of want, without they can dispose of it as is rated above."

I doe not find any body has been here to inventory either of the ffactoryes, soe am here will doe it my selfe, and when have donn will returne, God willing, with Mr Whiting. The inventory of Accraa ffactory, sent one by the sloope and the other will bring up with mee, being soe cold and wett in meeting with this great turnadoe that could not write my selfe, soe begg your worship will be pleased in answer to this, you will order Mr Whiting to inspect into Anamabo ffactory with mee, two heads being better then one."

Do desire by the first opportunity you would be pleased to send downe some tallow, sheets, blew perpettuanoes and good sayes, which are the only goods are likely to sell here, tread [= trade] being butt verry dull.

1300,2,660,Robert Elwes,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,26/05/1687,Fort,RAC,"Hereby you will receive a narrow stript sattin which Mr Boylston upon inventoring the Factory excepted against, it is as I received him, and by the end you may see it has nott been cutt. Had I the goods I formerly writt for could have disposed of a great quantity. Desire you would be pleased to add to them tenn barrells powder, one hundred lead barrs. Butt little news, only that Ahen Comenda had liked to have been poison'd by the Captain Cormantine Twone [= Towne], who was ffeede as they say by the King of Fettue."
1301,2,661,Robert Elwes,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,29/05/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours by the 7 hand canoe with 8 barrels of powder have received. Am very glad to hear of the arrivall of Captain Thompson, and hope by him we may be supplied with what goods we want."
1302,2,662,Robert Elwes,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,29/05/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 23th instant by the nine hand canoe have received, with five chests of sheetes, twenty half firkins of tallow and fifty lead barrs on account of the Royall Affrican Company of England. Hope from Captain Thompson wee may be supplyed with sayes and blew perpetuanoes. Shall observe your orders and make a distinct account of the goods received from you, and inclosed have sent three receipts for them."
1303,2,663,Robert Elwes,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,09/06/1687,Fort,RAC,"This comes by the nine hand canoe, from whom have received twenty five blew perpetuanoes, ten whole and thirty half ffirkins tallow, on account of the Royall Affrican Company of England. Since my arrivall here have understood that the Braffo and Quarranteers have debarred any traders from coming hither, on account that they are not paid their monthly customes for ground rent, likewise for putting small corn into the ground, which by information of Mr Hassell has never been allowed here but solely from Anamaboe. I desire your speedy answer in this case, that trade may not be hindred.
[PS] But little trade stirring."
1304,2,664,Robert Elwes,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,13/06/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 11th instant have received, and by reason of the badness of the weather could not answer it till now. Traders are still forbidden the ffactory, and that I can understand is only that as Anamaboe did formerly pay two cases of spiritts, being as well for Agga as there, as. Mr Hassell since his time has not paid but one for their putting their small corn into the ground. Then likewise I understand that the Braffo and Quarenteers are resolved that Anamaboe shall pay 1oz 8a per month and Agga 12a per month, which pallavera as yett they have not made with me, but as the Cappusheers here informe me. I tarry expecting an answer from the Braffo and Quarenteers, which is hindred by reason the excessive rains that has fallen there, so that all our trade here is hindred. Two dayes agoe Ahen, Domine and the Chief Cabbusheers of Anamaboe went up to Hebraw country with the intention to gett their assistance in pursuitt to their designe of fighting the Ffetues. My sheetes are all disposed to about 33, tallow one half of the small, more might have been had not this happened. When an answer comes from the Braffo you shall have immediate advice,
[PS] Mr Griffen has been some time ill."
1305,2,665,Robert Elwes,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,17/06/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 16th instant by Assina have received, and as to enlarging the ground rent have no more advice than what I formerly wrote you. Traders are no longer hindred. We are in dayly expectacon of the Quarenteers people down, on what account know not unlesse it be to receive their customes for putting small corn into the ground. You writt me that Mr Nightingale did not allow more than a few old knives, which I believe by his account does not appear so. They tell me here it was allwayes paid at Anamaboe, and Mr Hassell not as well paying of it in his time I believe has been the meanes of this pallavera. It is only a case of rumme, and if they demand it again there must be no contending, so hope it will be allowed. By Assina you will [receive] six markes, five ounces, and twelve angles of good gold, being for goods sold on account of the Royall Affrican Company of England. Desire I may have some more sheetes and half ffirkins of tallow, they being the most part of the produce of the said gold above menconed. But little trade for anything else.
[PS] Mr Griffen is something amended."
1306,2,666,Robert Elwes,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,19/06/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday arrived here three Dutch interlopers, who inform me of an English interloper lying to windward and designes to remain there two months, on what accompt I know not. Likewise came down the Curranteers people yesterday night and demanded for the future six piez per month ground rent, which I told them would not be allowed, so they desire your answer or they will stop trade, which with much perswasions to the contrary, or they would have done it already. I desire you would make a quick answer, in expectacon of which they now remain. I desire you would send the goods I wrote for, having in my hands two bendyes for sheetes, and more mony will come provided I have those goods desired. As to the case of spiritts must be forced to pay them for their small corn custome, pray give your real resolucon in this accompt, that trade may be no wayes hindered, for they are resolved to have so much of both ffactoryes or that wee deliver it to them again."
1307,2,667,Robert Elwes,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,21/06/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 20th instant have received, and according to your order sent for Mr Hassell, with whom this morning have discourst the Braffo and Quarenteers people that you are unwilling to give more for ground rent than what formerly were allowed them by your predecessors, so after a great insisting they demand two sayes, two anchors of brandy for both ffactoryes and that then they will give under their hands that no pallavera or hindrance of trade shall be any more permitted by them, which unlesse you allow that then they will have six pieze per month for each ffactory, or that wee deliver the ffactoryes to them, so have desired them to tarry til tomorrow, which they say shall be their extent, and in case of no answer that they will return and that trade shall be no longer admitted. Do also desire to know whether Mr Nightingale did ever give any thing to a Cappusheer that buyes cowes for the Ffanteens, demanding of me one course sletiae, one gallon of rum, and that Mr Nightingale did allways allow them once a year for both ffactoryes. Desire I may be acquainted about it, that I may not raise new customes. If you please to send the goods I formerly wrote for with some more blew perpetuanoes, I could dispose of them."
1308,2,668,Robert Elwes & Ralph Hassell,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,22/06/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of this days instant have received, and with Mr Hassell wee have made up the pallavera as cheap as possible could be, coppy of which have sent you. As for their monthly pay [it is] to be continued for both factorys as before. Shall not enlarge by reason have sent you the coppy of our agreements, and hope it will be for the Companys interest and your satisfaction. So I know not of any danger that may accrew but that you may with safety send down the goods I writt for, the sooner the better.
PS. I pray also when the canoe comes to send me fifty half ffirkins of tallow."
1309,2,669,Robert Elwes,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,25/06/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 24 instant by the nine hand canoe have received, with three hundred and ninety sheetes, sixty half ffirkins tallow, twenty four blew perpetuanoes and one green ditto on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England. Have according to your order sent up what corn the canoe would conveniently carry, quantity I know not, the Negroes having broke open the corn roome and stole with corn my chest [so] that I could not measure it, so must take it my your chest there. Have made a pallavera with the Cappusheers about it, and till new corn comes can not be satisyed. Do imagine may have lost fifteen chests of corn, as I allso told them. They promise me they will return me the damage. Am sorry it fell out in so unfortunate a time. It's not the first abuse wee have received from them, and to make complaint to the Braffo and Quarenteers is only an expence extraordinary, for the Anamaboe people do as they please and no contradiction to be given. Have received my self a sufficient damage from them, about tenn dayes agoe they came and destroyed my hoggs, some they shott dead and some they carried away with them, and plundered all the Agga people, not leaving them so much as a matt to ly on."
1310,2,670,Robert Elwes,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,26/06/1687,Fort,RAC,"This comes on purpose to desire you to send downe two hundred iron barrs that are marked, one case of course sletias, and six barrells of powder on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England. Wee understand that the Arcanyes have made peace with the Akims, so hope in a little time trade may encrease. Our factory is in a very bad condicon and wants repair very much. If you could spare Mr Chambers and a few slaves for a month it would be very acceptable."
1311,2,671,Robert Elwes,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,29/06/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 28th instant have received, with one hundred and sixty iron barrs, twenty course sletias, six whole barrells of powder on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England. According to order have putt on board the canoe what corn was remaining in the factory, being in all eleven chests. Here is not any more to be procured here as yett."
1312,2,672,Robert Elwes,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,04/07/1687,Fort,RAC,"These are to desire you to send down two hundred iron barrs more, having last month and with this disposed of most part. I would have sent up my accompts with the bearer, but understanding Mr Hassell designes to be with you tomorrow or next day, by whom you will receive them with the balance. If you can spare me four chests of sheets it will be very necessary. Mr Whiting has been detained here by reason of bad weather, endeavored once to get off but was forced to return, the canoe being full of water."
1313,2,673,Robert Elwes,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,07/07/1687,Fort,RAC,"This comes with my accompt and ballance, with the six marks five ounces twelve angles already sent up makes 10mk 01oz 00a 5 ta. I had sometime since sent my accompts up but expected Mr Hassell would have gone up, so finding to the contrary I now send them, and begg your pardon for the delay. I desire you would send the iron I writt for, with the sheetes and with them tenn boysadoes.
[PS] Captain Thompson saild from hence yesterday."
1314,2,674,Robert Elwes,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,08/07/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 7th instant have received, with two hundred iron barrs, four chests sheetes. Observe your order in selling iron at 20 or 22 per bendy, but believe the Negroes will not be brought to it. I could have sold most of them this day at 24 per bendy, but informing them your orders they told me they would rather buy the Dutch barrs, who sells at 28 per bendy. The Braffo and Quarenteers have been with me to receive their customes at danceing, which is two cases of rume, which has been given them. The Cappusheers also demand as much, but as yett have not received it till such time I have your order."
1315,2,675,Robert Elwes,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,13/07/1687,Fort,RAC,"Since your last orders for disposing iron barrs at 20 or 22 per bendy have sold none, and likewise but little trade, so desire to knoe whether you please to continue it further or no, here being mony but are unwilling to part with it unlesse you are pleased to sell iron at 24 per bendy, likewise do believe that I shall not sell them for more. I received from on board the Allegator sloop ten boysadoes on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England.
[PS] Have bought 1000 yamms for Captain Gould."
1316,2,676,Robert Elwes,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,20/07/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 19th instant by Mr Griffith have received, and am very sorry I cannot answer the contents, not having by me above of a chest and that old corne, and as yett here is no new corn. Neither do I believe when ripe, there will be any sold, reserving all as provisions for their intended warrs with the Ffetues, which may be, but not suddenly. As to any canoemens being abused, or anybody else belonging to Cabo Corso, it is their own faults, for did they not go to Anamaboe, they might remain here quiett, without any molestacon, but there they are and will be abused by the Bendefoes.
[PS] But little trade."
1317,2,677,William Cross,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,21/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"I arrived safe to Anamaboe, and went the next morning to Agga, according as you was pleased to order, and was received civily by the people of both places, who wait Mr Wights comeing downe, for the resetling of Annamaboe againe. I have no more to add at present, being yett a stranger, but in my next shall advise further."
1318,2,678,William Cross,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,27/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"The inclosed are a coppy of my Comenda accompts and an inventory of all the Royall Company merchandizes in this place taken by Mr Walker and my self. Wee find most of the goods to be very much damnified, which wee have vallued according to the best of our judgements. Here is very litle to do at present, but understanding from the Cabusheers in a short time, as soon as their pallavera is ended, there will be a good trade, in order to which they tell me that the Generall of the Mina is sending up a white man into the country with dasheys, and if you please to do the same the buisiness will be more easily and sooner composed, which is expected because the benefitt of the trade will be as much ours as theirs, and wee have the credditt with them. As trade presents I shall send for such goods as I shall see wanting, here being now occasion only for some rumme, a case of course sletias, and broad tapseils if any, which be pleased to send with my chests &ca. This invoyce is for your satisfaction of the Royall Company concerns. When Mr Wight comes all things are ready to be overhalled againe."
1319,2,679,William Cross,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,04/09/1687,Fort,RAC,"The occasion of my writing is the sending of the inclosed, and to acquaint you the Cabushers are very hard upon mee for their custom, being two perpettuanoes, one anckor of brandy, and a cloath to the Captain of the towne, which I hope you will be pleased to allow in soe expensive a place. Here is wanting the 5 hand canoe belonging to this Factory, and desire you will send in her one hogshead of rum for Captain Yabba, and the loest price, and as he likes that, he will buy half a dozen more as he tells mee."
1320,2,680,William Cross,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,09/09/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 7th and 8th instant I have received, the first by land the other by Mr Nightingale, with a caske of rum. Edward Jacklin is here, and Griffin will be up in a day or two. He has sent his chest and things by the canoe, and only stayes while I tell over the things againe. Here will be trade shortly if wee have goods come to supply them. I find Yabboy thought to have been trusted, butt since you have precautioned settles me more firme in the resolution of trusting none of them. I have not more to add at present, only I have occation for tenn barrells of powder, in whols and halves, and some halfe ffirkins of tallow if any."
1321,2,681,William Cross,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,11/09/1687,Fort,RAC,"This accompanies James Griffith, who stayed a little the longer to compose his affaires here, and are to desire you to send the goods I wrot for, with tenn cases of spiritts, by the first conveyance. Wee are in hopes of a trade as soon as goods that are wanting can be had."
1322,2,682,William Cross,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,13/09/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 12th instant by the 9 hand canoe I have received, with ten whole barrels of powder, and ten cases of spirits, all which I hope are come to a good markett. All things are well here."

All things are well here."
1324,2,684,William Cross,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,17/10/1687,Fort,RAC,"These are to acquaint you that the bearer, one of the best working slaves the Royall Company has here, being disabled at present by a cut in his ffingers, the other two cant putt the corne roome and ffactory in that nessessaty repaire which is wanting without more help, soe desire you would be pleased to order what you shall thinke convenient to the Cabushiers and they will assist mee in both. There is some corne lyes ready for me in the towne, which shall gett in as soone as I can gett the roome fixt, but here is a very bad trade for money, occasioned by five or six Dutch or Dane interlopers that have been up and downe neare these three weeks togather. By the first conveyance be pleased to send a caske of lime."
1325,2,685,William Cross,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,02/11/1687,Fort,RAC,"This accompanyes Edward Jackline, who brings my October accompt, and the ballance. Here has been butt little trade till within this four days, which makes my takins soe small. I have occasion for one hundred iron barrs, and a caske of lime to help to repaire the ffactory. The corne roome I have gott donn, and suppose shall quickly purchase the quantity of corne you have ordered. The ffactory is verry much out of repaire, and with your leave shall agree with the Cabusheers, and gett itt don us cheape as possible.

Tis true here is but little trade now, but they tell me in two months wee shall have as good takings as has been knowne for a considerable time. Yesterday and this day I tooke in about one hundred chests, all very good corne, and if you are pleased to order more than what you did before, I shall accordingly purchase it. Now is the time, for shortly they have new corne and that will not be so fitt for your purpose."
1327,2,687,William Cross,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,15/11/1687,Fort,RAC,"The occasion of my writeing is to desire you to send me eight chests of sheets, one hundred and fifty Guinea stuffs, and fifty iron barrs, I have taken in about two hundred chests of corne, for damnified goods, and if you have occasion for more, be pleased to advise.

Yesterday came downe one of the French ships, he sent his boate ashoare with men twice to Annishan and will endeavor to settle there. Mr Nightingale took all the Bantefoes and mett them there, of which I suppose he will advise."

On Saterday last I dispatched James Bayly in the Adventure sloope, with one hundred chests of corne, according to your order. Inclosed is a coppy of their customary dashes here at Christmas, the originall of which they brought me, to demand it. I told them I would advise you first, and what you were pleased to order they should have, but here are noe ginghams. I have occasion for another man if you can conveniently spare one, that is civill and honest."
1332,2,692,William Cross,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,21/12/1687,Fort,RAC,"The occasion of my writing is to acquaint you that last night wee had the misfortune to have the warehouse broake open but lost only four fine sletias, which lay next at hand. They gott in under the tha[t]ch, made a hole through the sealing, and soe stole them out. I sent this morning for the Cabushiers about it, and they promised to pay for the goods and secure the thieves if they can find them out. I thought it proper to advise imeadiately of this, that I may know your further pleasure."

I had sent sooner, but was hindered, by the Cabushiers palavering about their customes and dashes this Christmas. There is a green perpetuanoe and four gallons of rum to be paid to the Captain of the Arcanyes which I forgott to advise of before. I desire you would be pleased to send one hundred and fifty iron barrs, forty halfe firkins of tallow, two hundred Guynea stuffs, four chest of sheets, one hundred one pound pewter basons, and ten boysados, if any. I have gott the Factory new thatcht and repaired at the cheapest rate I could. It had stood soe long that when they came upon it most of the stantions [= stanchions] and rafters broake in, which put me to more charges to gett new ones in their places. By this conveyance I have sent up a man and weoman slaves, the woman is brought to December accompt but the man is not.

The inclosed is John Garrards receipt for one man and two weomen slaves, which with the woman you received last, makes one man and three weoman slaves, being all that are brought to my December accompts, soe I thinke there is noe occasion of altering them againe, for the man slave returned have not brought to accompt, as I suppose you thought I had. I was indeed overseene in him, but for the future shall be more curious, if slaves present."
1336,2,696,William Cross,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,28/01/1688,Fort,RAC,"The inclosed coming this morning to my hands occasions my sending now, being desired to forward it with all expedition. The Fanteens are preparing for the warr with Fetu, and tis said in a very short time will fight them. They keepe up the corne to see the event of the warr, soe that their is very little to be purchased at present. What I have by me is about two hundred chests."

Here has been two angles per month always allowed to the Captain of the Prea, which since my time I have not paid, because I had not your order, The Cabushiers came the other day and made a greate pallaver about it. I told them there was no question but you would allow what had been formerly, of which be pleased to advise. By this conveyance have sent a good weoman slave."

Most of the windward trade is coming this way, and had you sheets, says and perpetuanoes to supply us with our takings would be like those formerly at Comenda, for good Arcany gold. I have occasion for 200 iron barrs and a case of fine sletias, and about 40 gallons of rum, which be pleased to send by the first conveyance. These two angles per month to the Captain of the Prea was always charged by Mr Robert Elwes to the Company in his accompts, and not given by him. I am at four angles per month charge to servants in the Factory besides this, which if you are not pleased to allow I must pay it my selfe. Twas Captain Peaw that received it formerly, but he has been dead about this six months, and there is another in his place, which is to looke after all goods that come ashoare and corne that goes off, to see that nothing be wanting or lost."

I hear the King of Fanteen is dead, and that Captain Eggin is to succeed, which I am told will put some stopp to our trade, as well for gold as corne, till all things are resetled as formerly,"
1341,2,701,William Cross,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,03/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"By this conveyance, have sent you up by February accounts and the ballance. The King of Fanteens death has put a stopp to all trade, or elce my takings had been considerable. Captain Eggin I hear is with the army, and will not sturr till he has resetled Ahen in his old place at Fetoo. Where [= when] that pallavera is over, and the other established here there will be a good trade againe. These things happening thus has put me to great charges, for I was forced to pay to the army half a barrell of powder and eight gallons rum, and towards the Kings buriall a stript carpett, two sheets, and eight gallons of rum more, which they sayed had ever been allowed them upon the like occasions, and I find if I had denied them it I should have brought a worse trouble upon my self, among such people as these are. I have not brought any of this to accompt, but humbly advise, hoping you will be pleased to allowe the charge, or at least some part of it. I had in a chest of sheets forty six which were very much damnified, by salt water. I have disposed of twenty one, at ta6 per piece, and for the rest I can get nothing, so have sent up twenty five, judging they may serve for the Doctor, or some other use, for here they will turn to no accompt at all.
[PS] This chest of sheets I suppose received the damage in the shipp they came over in."

What I have in the Factory is about two hundred and ten chests. Corne is very scarce now, occasioned by the warrs, and am afrayd will be dear, but I hope to purchase what you have ordered in a short time, having a promise from some of the Cabushiers, of which as it comes in shall timely advise. If you please to send downe a canoe with the next shipp, she will be the sooner dispatched, for here are none good. I paid towards the Kings funerall two sheets, eight gallons of rum, and a carpett, which I hope you will be pleased to allow, for I have been at great charge to the army besides this.
[PS] Nicholas Bidle is very sick and weake."

I likewise went to Annishan, and there togather with Mr John Bloome and Mr William Ronan inventoryed that Factory, as you were pleased to order. Here is no trade, by reason of the warrs, but as soon as money presents, which I hear will not be long, shall advise of what goods there will be occasion for. By the first conveyance, will send up the woman slave, which is brought March accompt, there being none now."
1344,2,704,William Cross,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,16/04/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday morning came here the Corrantiers people to demand custom for their masters putting his small corne into the ground, which they say is two cases of spiritts allowed by the Company. I told them I knew nothing of it, but would advise, and what you were pleased to order, they should have. With this answer they were not contented, but threatened to shutt us up in the Factory, and suffer none to come out nor in till they were satisfied, and had don it, I beleive, had not some of the Cabushiers perswaded them to the contrary. They are gon up againe to the masters, and left word in three days wee should heare farther from them. I cannot tell whether this has been formerly allowed or no, so humbly advise, desiring to know your pleasure. I shall be at some charge here to the Cabushiers upon the like occasion. I have gott no corne in yett, but dayly expect their bringing in considerable quantity, for in a litle time twill be plenty."
1345,2,705,William Cross,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,26/04/1688,Fort,RAC,"Having some hope of a trade, these are to desire you would be pleased to send eight chests of sheets, one hundred and fifty Guynea stuffs, fifty lead barrs, and ten cases of spirritts. Powder likewise will bare a good price if you have any to dispose of.
The Currantiers people came againe and would not be putt of under two cases of spirritts. Tis as I understand what they were paid last yeare upon the like occasion. Be pleased to send a hundred or two of one pound pewter basons if any."
1346,2,706,William Cross,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,30/04/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the same date have received by the 9 hand canoe, with eight chests containing five hundred and twenty sheets, eighty nine Guynea stuffs, fifty lead barrs, two hundred one pound pewter basons, and ten whole cases of sprritts, in one of which there is a bottle broken. Here is a woman slave which should have come up with last months account, but till now there has been no conveyance, and both the women ffactorys slaves being taken very sick and paine, I have put her to do their worke, but as soon as they are well will send this up. I have been very much indisposed these three or four days, with ague and feavour."
1347,2,707,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,15/01/1686,Fort,RAC,"I haveing been very ill and not as yette recovered of an ague and feaver, and also most of our people taken down by fluxes, prevented my writing before; niether amable as yett to finish my December accompt but hope within three or four dayes to be better in health. Trade is very bad by reason of the multiplicity of shipping. I understand by some cannoes belonging to the Mine that some of the people of Kittowes hath cutt some of Captain Crookshanks people heads of: wheather certainely I know not, however Captain Lowe and Captain Ounsteed heard the same newes, so they may be more cautious how they venture ashore in those parts. The goods we want here are vizt tapseiles broad, black bafts, and sheets. Ahenesa is fighting against the Argins, who [= Ahenesa] is an hindrance to our trade."
1348,2,708,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,24/01/1686,Fort,RAC,"I haveing this opertunity of sending could not lett slip informing you that some Mine canoes some dayes agoe came from Ardra, which informes that the Chaldron [sic: = Charlton] sloope, Captain Latton Comander, the slaves rise on board her and killed all the white men, affterwards cutt the cable, which occasioned her running ashoar, and staved all to peices. This news is not only by the negroes, but by the Dutch ffactors, who hath received letters from those parts. As to trade never was soe bad since my resident here. As to Captain Carters bussiness and news of a pyrate, I shall not give an account, but reffer your Worship to his letter. I hope he is safe. Here I am at present much better then I was. We are in want of broad tapseiles, sheets and black bafts, also allejars. Lime and nailes we want much."
1349,2,709,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,27/01/1686,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships of the 25th instant received per Captain Bridges with the goods consigned, vizt ten chests of sheets and one hundred allejars. I am sorry your Worship has noe tapseiles and black bafts in the Castle of Cabo Corso, which sorte of goods the Dutch are well supply'd with. Blanquetts I am well supply'd with, and all sorts of other goods. Trade is very bad, soe I have not taken three mark this month, also slaves very scarce. The ship Mary has been noe small hindrance to our negociation. I shall use my utmost endeavour to procure cowes for Captain Bridges, doubt but must be fforced to send to Olampo for them, here being none to be had for mony. We are in extream want of lime to repair the fflankers belonging to the Castle and other necessarys, which if not done will tumble down. Inclosed is as also a bill of sundrey necessarys wanting to the gunns, which we cannot be without, if we should have ocasion in our defence. Also we want more nailes.

Never meet with such a dull trade, especially this last month, and now Ahenesa hath stopped the way, not suffering any Quamboers to come down the water side, by reason some of them bough[t] a quantity of powder out of some ships and carry it up in baggs, as generally they doe salt, that it might have ffree passage, as being that comodity. Upon the discovery of it, [he] ordered none to goe down the seaside lest they should by more and supply the Arcanyes with it, who [he] is afraid will come down and rout him out of his cuntrey. How long he will continue in this mind of stopping trade I know not. I have sent up to him about it. I wrote your Worship some dayes agoe of some of Captain Crookshanks people being cutt of at Kittowe. It seems it is a mistake, it was Captain Sylvanus Paine and seaven more of his white men. The quarrell begun about filling of water at that place. The said Paine run one of the Negroes through with his sword. Presently affter, they shot Paine on the head, with the rest of the white men then there present. This news brought Captain Crookshanks canoe men, and Phynye, a black boy which went to Ardra with the said Crookshanks. Captain Brouse put on board Captain Pains ship some of his men, she being disabled of seaven or eight. Mr Carter at Ardra is very well, he designs to come up as soon as those ships that are their are dispatcht. This day arrived from thence four great Mine canoes. The sloope Captain Laton and all his men are killed by the slaves which he had then aboard. Your Worship wrote me last for cowes, accordingly I sent to Olampo but can gett none thats good, but are all leane, haveing had noe raines this considerable time, that they have nothing to ffeed on, an[d] soe it is with sheep. We are in extream want of lyme, one of the fflankers being ready to tumble down, and part of the tower. Also other places that wants to be repaired, or else will come to ruine. We want also nayles, hooks and hinges and deal boards. I must inform you that William Warner the smith will not doe the smiths office, unless his wages be advanced more then a souldiers pay, here being severall musquetts and other gunns that will spoile if not cleaned and mended. Your Worship promised to send us another gunner in the rome of Thomas Amis, deceased, here being none that can take it upon them, only one and he can niether write nor read, but is a great drunckard."
1351,2,711,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,16/02/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 12th instant is received, and according to order I, Mr Swindall and one Mr Manning went and delivered your Worships letter to Mynherr Hans Luke but could not have an answer, only that upon my desireing him either to write or to give me one by word of mouth, he replyed he would send his boy to me tomorrow with a letter, which he never did, although I sent my boy twice to him this day to know wheather he had wrote any, according to his promis. I found presently that your Worships letter was very unwelcome to him, who I think will not nor never will give answer to it.
In answer as to your Worships of the 9th instant, I have tryed all means to procure oyster shells to repaire the Castle, here being none to be had. If there was any your Worship may imagine that the Dutch, which have a very fine lyme kill, would never be supply'd soe constantly from the Mine as they are generally. What oyster shells that is here are very few, and those they pick up from the salt ponds. Neither have we a lyme kill. Besides if their was any possibillity, we could not have time enough before the raines to gett all materialls ready, and the Castle wants much repairing, if not done soone I doubt part of it will tumble down. The walls within are built with swich [= swish]. As for timber, we want much deal boards, and nailes of all sortes, also some tarris. Trade is better than it was last month, now they are for snaphances and carbines of the longest sorte. If your Worship have any in the Castle, I humbly desire your Worship to send a quantity of, here being but a ffew carbines in the ffactory. Let the carbines be of the smallest sorte and longest sorte. The Dutch sells great quantitys at 12 carbines per bendy, and 10 snaphans per bendy. These goods I want much at present. Here lyes a Dutch interloper, and a great Ffrench man. As to what the Company makes me debtor, I have examined my accounts and receipts, finding that I have paid more then what the goldtaker Mr Master gives me credditt for in the Journall, as per receipt. Inclosed is an account of what I have paid, and what remaynes due to the Company. I would had come up had not trade come in lately. We want some black bafts and some broad tapseiles. Inclosed is also my August account. According to your Worships order I told the armourer that if he would not work according to his agreement he should goe to Cabo Corso, now he is willing to work provided he be cleared from duty; if so, I desire your Worship to send another man in his roome. I am in extream want of writeing paper and large paper for my accounts."
1352,2,712,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,02/03/1686,Fort,RAC,"According to your Worships order with much adoe have procured this inclosed from the Agent of the Deans. I was forced to send my boy twice to him this day, before he would comply. At last I sent him a note, a copy of which is here inclosed, then he sent this letter. By the bearer your Worship will receive my account for February, and the ballance thereof being 6m 3o 6a of gold. We want more sheets, tapseiles, and materialls for the Castle, inclosd is an account. I have a good quantity of very good slaves, if Mr Bayly comes down againe. We shall want corne and a kettle to boyle canky for the slaves, here being one which I had of Mr Bayly, which is good for nothing. I am in want of a gunner, I am informed that there is one in James Bayley that can officiat that place. Also want carpenters tooles and smiths tooles, as fformerly wrot."
1353,2,713,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,16/03/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yours per Mr Slade and goods per Mr James Baily have received, and according to order have dispatch Mr Brown with twenty five men and twenty woman, very good slaves. With what he had before from Cabo Corso makes in all two hundred and seventeen males and femayles slaves, as per bill of loading doth apear. Inclos'd is three, one according to order with the noat of the mens wages. Have inclos'd it in Collonel Steeds letter at Barbadoes, mentioning therein how many men, women, boys, girles amounts in the whole. As to what your Worship is troubled in not sending my slaves per the sloop, is because I had noe order. I did not know but might displease your Worship, for the future shall not lett slip noe opertunity. I wish your Worship had sent more sheets, they putting of other goods. Inclos'd is an account of all materialls, and dementions of them, wanting at Accra. We want more lyme to compleat the Castle, which will be a great preservation of the same against the raines. The tanck wholes [= holds] water very well and is likely to continue soe. Doctor Mead dyed last night, and hath maid Mr Swindall his executor. I shall for the future send the mony in a five hand canoe. First must see to procure one, this I have is all broak, it will serve some time to land goods.
[PS] Just now is arrived the ship James from the Mina."
1354,2,714,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,18/03/1686,Fort,RAC,"I hope by this time the sloope is arrived with you affter such a strong turnado and furious raine, which hath occasioned one of the fflankers towards the land to fall down. We cannot raise it without more lyme and a little tarris. Eight hogshead of lyme and one hogshead of tarris or theirabout will goe nigh to compleat all and pint [= point] out the outward work, which will be a great preservation of the forte. We want also more hooks and hinges, ten for the hall windows, bigger than those that was sent last, [they] being short to enter the walls, haveing no hold. Also a few more nayles and those things according to the gunners noate sent per James Baily, carpenters tooles and a few deal boards. As for goods, we want more sheets, broad tapseiles, blew perpetuanoes. Those sheets sent last are almost gon, we sell none but for gold. As to blew sallampores, I have not the price of then [= them], which I desire per next. I must informe your Worship that severall good slaves presents but cannot buy them, haveing noe irons to secure them, haveing spared all I had to Captain Brown, who wanted them much, so desire you to furnish me as soon as possible."
1355,2,715,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,04/04/1686,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships received per James Bayley with those goods sent by the same conveyance. I have sent back which will not vend, one hogshead of flower rum containing 68 gallons, 22 fine sallampores, 20 damag'd bafts being taken out of the 12 sent last. More you will receive per the same conveyance mk6 4oz 10a 10ta being the ballance of my March account. Inclos'd is an account of the same, and what slaves I had I have according to order sent up also. When I have direct'd in building up the flanker, and taken an account of the delivery of the Company concerns to Mr Thomas Price, shall not faile to come up with those papers tending to the said Company ever since the departure of Agent Greenhill in April 1683. As for other matters shall acquaint your Worship of the same at my arrivall, which shall be as soon as possible. Your Worship will receive 11 man and 22 women slaves. We are in want of green, read and blew perpetuanoes. I would had return'd the lyme cask had Mr Bayley had taken them in."
1356,2,716,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,08/05/1686,Fort,RAC,"Arriving here this morning, heard of a disteurbance which has happened since my departure from my factory, occasion'd by the bearer Shadrick Harrison, a drunken sott. Had it been the first time, I had not sent him up as yett; now finding all promises in vain, could prevail with him noe longer. He tells me he lived to well, and that's the only reason of his obsurdity and sottishness, and further his time is almost out, is also a means and putts him on his ffiggaries and resolutions. I hope your Worship will stop out of his pay a ffirelock musquett which he broak in two peices in time of doeing duty, also the charge of this canoe and four gallons of rum left unpaid due to the Company.
William Warner the smith died before my arrivall, so that we are now destitute of such a man, also one in drunken Shadricks room, which hope your Worship will furnish us with them per first. Trade has been very bad since my departure, what reason I know not as yett but shall inquire further in that matter and per next shall return advice of all other matters. The Adventure sloop is very leakey, being forced to pump continually.
PS. Here is a man ashoar at the Deans fort who was left ashore out of the Jamaica sloop that was at Succondee. If your Worship thinks it fitting I will send him up or intertaine hime [= him] here, he haveing proffer'd his servis both to Dutch and Deanes. The said sloop am informed is returnd to Jamaico, and the reason of this fellows leaveing her I doubt is for no good. Inclosed is a sample of bead, if any in the Castle desire a small quantity for a tryall."
1357,2,717,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,27/05/1686,Fort,RAC,"This is occasion'd up by re[a]son of our great necessity of corn, haveing not above five chests left, and sundry slaves besides those belonging to the Castle. Could buy more [slaves] but cannot for want of the same. I have wrote to Mr Bayly, who I understand is at Lague, that if he hath a quantity of corn immediately to come down and supply our want, and stopt his cano from goeing any farther, if not then to forward this to your Worship to acquaint you thereof, or elce the said sloop to come down and take the slaves on board her in order for their passage to Cabo Corso. Trade is soe bad, we take little or nothing of gold by reason of the war that is between the Arguins and Ahenesaw. We want the following goods, vizt broad tapseiles, sheets, black bafts, knives, and blew perpetuanoes; also for the Castles use deal boards, some lyme and tarris, by reason of sundrey leaks we find by the furious rains we have here dayly. By James Baily shall send up my account and the ballance theirof. Here is an enquirey for bouges for slaves, if any in the Castle it will be convenient to send some with the price of the same. As to other matters shall refer till then."
1358,2,718,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,05/06/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 31st of May and of the 3d instant is come to hand, and according to order shall procure what slaves possible I can against Captain Thomas Woodfines comeing down. I have now by me 30 very good slaves, 16 men 14 women. Had I not been necessitated for want of provisions I might have encreased the number. Trade has been very dull these two months, haveing taken little more than will defray the charges of the Castle. Ahenessa haveing war with the Argins is great hindrance to the negotiation in these parts. I am sorry we canot be supply'd with those goods I write for in my last. Inclos'd is my accounts for Aprill and May. The ballance thereof is 1mk 0oz 8a 4ta, which you will receive per bearer. Captain Quo is at Annamaboe. I wait'd his comeing down, elce I had sent up these accounts 5 dayes agoe, they being then finish'd. We are in extream want of a seaven hand cano. Our five hand cano is quite rotten and not fitt to goe on the water any more. Should have a seaven or nine hand canoe for conveniency of landing goods ashore. This goes by the two hand cano that came from Cabo Corso per Captain Woodfine. I hope your Worship will supply us with lime and tarris, slitt deals and whole ditto, a few nayles of all sorts."
1359,2,719,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,29/06/1686,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships per Captain Thomas Woodfine have received [with] those goods consign'd this place. Those now wanting are per inclosed note; if any of those sorts are to be had with you I humbly desire your Worship to furnish us with them as soon as possible, we wanting them much, as also a great cano, which we canot well be without. These goods according to directions did take on shore for slaves put on board said Woodfine. As to the bouges and manobut bands we are as yet ignorant of the disposall, not knowing what quantity we must vend for slaves or gold, which I desire your Worship to inform us per next. Per the bearer your Worship will receive mk1 6oz 6a 11ta being the true ballance of the inclosed account. Trade is very dull with us by reason of the rumors of wars in the inland. I am sorry must informe your Worship of the death of Doctor Josuah Pratt, who deceasd the 27th instant, at 3 a clock in the morning, of a violent feaver that heald him about nine days. His last will and testament, coppy hereof is here inclosed. As to an inventory of his things, is mentioned in said will and testament, he haveing put his whole estate in it. As to the disposall of them, shall waite your Worships answer. Here is also sun[d]rey people sick in this Castle, which I fear will indanger their lives for want of a good Doctor. The Deans Castle is almost all tumbled down."
1360,2,720,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,18/07/1686,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships of the 16th instant per Captain Quow received with a promiss of being supplyed per the sloop very spedily with the good[s] and materialls for the Castle so far for that you have them. I hope now it will not be long before they come, we wanting them, as also herba longees, red ground and no other couler. It will also be very convenient to send some more short irons and mallegetta for slaves use, and a pair of great stilliards, which we canot be without. We have now put twenty five very good slaves, sixteen men and nine women, which shall be sent per ditto sloop according to former order. Ahenesa went from Quamboe about 10 dayes agoe to the Arcanyes in order to war in those parts, so that we canot expect anything of a trade before his return, then may expect a considerable trade, which canot be this two months at least. The conveniency is an inclos'd per via Mine. Here is arriv'd from windward the great Portuguez ship and a Dutch interloper, also two more at Barracoe. We have not a man well in the Castle, being all trobled with the feavers, in so much that they are not capable of doein[g] duty."
1361,2,721,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,12/08/1686,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships of the 4th instant received with the goods therein mention. Only two broad nicconees wanting in the baile no. 152, also one pautkey in the whole number as per inclos'd attestation appears. It will be very convenient for Mr Bayly affter his discharging his Negro slaves at Cape Coast to come down againe and ly at Barraco, where I am informd slaves are plenty, which cannot be brought here by reason Ahenesah having war with Arguina. The Dutch are orderd to procure what slaves they can, some dayes agoe they sent 50 by a great cano that brought them a supply of goods, having liberty to give any sort of goods for them, and I detaind of such an order, is a great hindrance to me in porcureing them. By this conveniency your Worship will receive forty seaven slaves, 30 men 17 women, good Negroes. I must inform your worship that then [= when] I came down from Cape Coast four chests of sheets [ms 'sheest'] was put on board the Adventure Sloop and consignd me, of which I received but three and gave criditt for no more in my accounts, but doubt am charg'd with them all; if not rectified will be prejudiciall to me. We want more irons, Mr Bayly was forced to make use of them he brough[t] down last. If he should come down again, lett him allso bring more rum and red herba longees, if to be had good. Also the great guns belonging to the Castle are viz. 2 sacer, 5 minion, 5 faulconet, 4 faulcon, the weight we cannot justly tell.
[PS] I am afraid we shall loose Mr Swindall, who is dangerous sick."
1362,2,722,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,18/08/1686,Fort,RAC,"My last to your Worship was the 12th instant per the sloop with fourty seaven slaves, 30 men 17 women. This per via Mina, desireing your Worship to supply us per the sloop or other conveniency with more broad nicconees, red ground herba longees, also rum, if any black bafts, if not to send us some black sallompores, course not fine, with its price, and the price of the stript sattins sent per James Baily. I am sorry there is no blew perpetuanoes, broad tapseiles, Dutch umbanees or phota longees, sheets, which sorts of goods are sutable for this place. The Dutch by great quantity of slaves with sheets and take great quantitty of mony, for they have bought all the Deans slaves with the same comodity. I must inform your Worship they have lowered powder to one ounce per barrell, they have such great quantity at the Mine and now is become a very dull comodity. The 16th instant deceas'd Mr Swindall of a feaver at 3 a clock in the morning. A coppy of his last will and testament shall send per the next opertunity, he has left all to his wiffe and children. Here is most of the white men sick. We want more short irons, the sloop haveing carried those away which were sent last."
1363,2,723,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,22/08/1686,Fort,RAC,"My last to your Worship was the 18th instant per via Mine, since received yours of the 20th ditto. According to order shall procure as many good negro slaves as opertunity presents. Also the gold with my accounts shall be sent up at the months end according to direction as formerly done. I wrote your Worship also per James Bayly, who depart'd hence the 12th instant with forty seaven slaves, 30 men 17 women. In my last inform'd your Worship of the death of Mr Swindall, who died the 16th instant of a violent feaver, also what goods was wanting at Accra, which as per inclosed noate. Trade is something better than it was. Ahenesa desires of your Worship to spare him a Company stick or cane, he being afraid that some of Quambo people come down in his name. This he desired me to write to your Worship sundrey times before, but forgot it. Goods wanting at Accra, vizt nicconees broad, a good quantity; pautkais white, one bail; rum, a good quantity; Dutch umbanees or phota longees, a good quantity; and red ground ginghams; herba longees and silk longees, red ground no other coller; sheets, a great quantity, whereof one chest is owing to me, I standing indebt'd for it which never had per James Bayley; blew perpetuanoes, red and green, but especially blew, a great quantity; black bafts, a great quantity, if not to be had, then black sallompires not of the finest sorte; tapseiles broad, a great quantity; also broad pintadoes, red ground, a good quantity; allejars, a great quantity of the reddish sort. The above said goods if to be had are the goods wanting here which will produce gold or slaves.
Memorandum, To send the prizes of the stript sattins, to send us also the prizes of the black sallompores not of the finest sort, also to any new goods that shall come down. To send us more corn and short irons for the slaves, Mr Bayly carried them away which he brought down. The Dutch have filled their sloop full of goods to trade at Barraco, the natives being not sufferd to come down."
1364,2,724,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,31/08/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 24th instant per the Ann Sloop with those goods consigned here have received. The goods now wanting are as underneath mentioned. Here would be a very great trade if had goods proper for this parts. I am sorry your worship did not supply us with blew perpetuanoes wrote for in my last, also greens and reds. Those pintadoes sent by Hugh Hilling are most of them white ground, which none but read will vend here, so desire a greater supply per next. As to slaves I have now per me fourty Gold Coast, 25 men 15 women. Slaves are something scarse, and Olampo slaves none are to be had. My people came from thence three dayes, who informs me none are to be had in those parts. Mr Helling I suppose this day is gott to Barraco. By the bearer your Worship will receive mk5 3o 5a being the true ballance of my August account. Inclosed is also coppy of Mr Robert Swindalls last will and testament. People are still very sickly at this place. I desire your Worship to supply us with a new fflag staff and halliards, we haveing none at present, the old one is for nothing. We want also a paire of stilliards, haveing none to weigh anything, upon occasion. Goods wanting at Accra, vizt herba longees, red grounds; Dutch umbanees or longees photaes; sheets; perpetuanoes blew, read and green; black bafts, as those sent last are almost gone; read ginghams if to be had; white pautkeis; some brawles."
1365,2,725,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,11/09/1686,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships of the 7th instant have received with goods theirin mentioned per the seaven hand cano, which shall be disposed according to directions. The goods now wanting are, vizt more sheets, blew perpetuanoes, redd ground pintadoes, pautkeis white, photaes, red ginghams. I must inform your Worship that the Dutch sells a good quantity of powder but it is in quarter barrells, the blacks will buy no others, half nor whole, of which I have enough by me; if any of the first size, it will be convenient to send some per the return of this conveniency. By the seaventeen hand cano goes forty slaves, 22 men 18 women; could have 50, only hearing Mr Helling at Barracoe had some by him, which he canot so conveniently keep them on board as on shoar, so shall keep the rest untill the return of the said cano, in which time I hope shall provide her another cargoe. Mr Price is very ill, who hath continued so this four dayes of a violent pain in his belly and hard bound withall flies up into his head; God knows what will become of him if no remydy of a doctor, which we canot have here, both Dean and Dutch doctor are trobled with the same distemper. We are also in great want of a Serjant, and for the Castles use a pair of stilliards, a flagstafe and halliards. I desire your Worship to send the irons back per the same conveniency, we haveing hardly any more left to secure slaves."
1366,2,726,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,19/09/1686,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships of the 15th instant per the seaventeen hand cano with fourty chests corne have received. By the same your worship will receive ten slaves, vizt 5 men 5 women, with what Hugh Hilling hath on board I beleive will make the number of ffifteen or twenty, which had it not been for him could had supplyd you with the like number. James Bayly is not yet arriv'd but hope it will not be long. Inclosed is a noate from the gunner for matterials wanting."
1367,2,727,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,30/09/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 15th instant per the seaventeen hand cano with 40 chests of corn have received. Received also, that of the 26th ditto per James Bayly with the goods therein mentioned, which shall be disposed of when opertunity presents on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company for their best advantage. This accompanyes Edward Jacklin, one of the Company apprentice, who for want of his health in these parts has a greater desire to live at Cabo Corso, according to his request have sent him up; by him goes m65 1o 7a 8ta, ballance of the enclos'd account for September. Trade is grone very low again by reason Ahenesah warring Occrepon. Slaves also are grone very scarce, the Dutch here has risen men at a bendy and women at seaven peaze, being an express order sent downe from the Generall of the Mine for the dispatch of Captain Star, a Dutch Company ship, now to windward, who is expected within this four dayes, with Mr Eurnthuys Merchant, now at Morea, to goe in her to Olampo for slaves, which I fear will prove very disadvantagious to Mr Bayley, now there, from whome I have received twelve, vizt 7 men 5 weomen, slaves. I have not bought one slave since the Dutch has risen the above said price. Here is now in the Castle 48, which is enought for the great canoe pasage up. I must inform your Worship that the natives will not buy a blew perpetuano with a green, which is the reason will not vend. Edward Jacklin is paid to the next pay day. Captain Brandfill went hence the 25th instant for Whiddah."
1368,2,728,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,10/10/1686,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships of the 4th and 6th instant per the 17 hand cano with 25 chests of corn have received. Per the same goes what slaves is now by me, vizt thirty: 15 men 15 women. I shall according to order procure what Gold Coast slaves presents and allow the price currant. Inclosed is a letter from James Bayly to me, complayning the dearness and scarcity of slaves at Allampo, which is occasioned by the Dutch, who have sent down an express order to keep them for Captain Starr who is dayly expected. Slaves are also grone very scarce here, and trade very dull for gold.
In the cano goes Mr Griffin of Agga, who being sent on board Captain Poston by Mr Nightingale for certain things for the gunners use wanting at Annamabo, the said Griffins canomen that carryd him on board, stole some of the said Postons ships provitions then a wattering in a tubb, which occasiond them to run away. Captain Poston had no conveniency of landing him nowere but here last Sunday in the evening. I have also received two roles [sc. of tobacco?], for which shall give the Company credditt, and shall endeavour to pay the slaves and black freemen with the same. I have also per the bearer sent up 1oz 8a for two cask of palm oyle."
1369,2,729,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,21/10/1686,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys James Bayly, by whome I have sent twelve Negro Gold Coast slaves, vizt six men and six women. I have little or nothing to inlarge, no more than the bad information of a bad trade, haveing not taken soe much this month I fear as will defray the charges of the Castle, which is occasion'd by Ahenesah is now goeing to warr Occrepon, his motion will be next Satterday, soe that it will not be long before our negotiation will improve itselfe.
I must informe your Worship that the 25 chest of corne that came last by the seaventeen hand canoe from Annamaboe is not fitting to give to hoggs, what to doe with it I know not.
Also must ffurther informe your Worship that Hugh Hilling spend[s] his time idely, he comes runing down here with the sloope from Barraco, leaveing the Dutch a tradeing there, pretending to come down on noe other accompt than to put of his goods, which is very well known his intention was to cut his beard, and now his humour takes him to run up to Mountford. His adversary the Dutch are well sattisfied with it. He tells me it is your Worships orders for him to trade under my nose, I told him it was no such thing."
1370,2,730,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,31/10/1686,Fort,RAC,"My last was by James Bayly, hope this time is safe arrived. This accompanys my monthly accompts with the ballance and product of a bad trade, being mk1 1o 4a 2ta. I hope in a shorte time to find an alteration, now Ahenesah haveing beaton Ocrepon, will not be long ere slaves and gold will be more plenty, being now very scarse. The Dutch Company shipps Captain Starr is still at Olampo, his cargo consisteth most in bouges. James Bayly parted hence in good time, elce his stay would a bin to little purpose.
I have now by me 16 Negro slaves. We have had no incouragement of trade all this month, the cuntrey people have absented from hence all along by reason of the above said warrs, now allmost ended. We are dayly in expectation of the Generall of the Mines comeing in these parts, upon what account I cannot learne of any; I suppose you may have heard to windward, if soe pray advise if possible on what account he comes. Nothing shall be wanting per me to uphold the Companys intrest.
I must desire your worship when opertunity presents to ffurnish us with lyme and blacks [= balcks], here being a flanker and some of the souldiers houses if not taken up will fall downe. Haveing not elce to inlarge, only we have noe stilliards no more."
1371,2,731,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,08/11/1686,Fort,RAC,"I having this oppertunity by an Annamaboe canoe, cam in good time to answer your Worships of the 3 instante, and cheifly to desire your worship by firste conveniency to furnish us whith pautkaes white, broad striped sattins, and som sayes; alsoe for Castles use a quantyty of lime and tarris whith some balkes, and for slaves use some corne, long irons and shortt irons, for I know not how suddenly may come a greatt quantity, they coming dayly more and more verry good Gold Coaste slaves from Ahennesah. I sent Ashumah to him with an anchor of rum and a cloath for that purpose, which I find has toock effect: doe verry belive whithin this month to find greatt alteration of trade. I have now by mee twenty five good Gold Coaste Negroes.
As to the Generall of the Mine his coming downe here, if he comes, will not be [I] verry[ly] belive upon any inchrochmente into the Deanes ffortte; if so, shall endeavor to ffollow your worships orders. The Deanes are in a verry low condition. Should the docter, who is the only moneyed man and chief trader and manneger of all things acted in that fforte, dye, the Generall in the firste place would starve, for he hath not a cracra of himself. The rest of the people trade for themselves, reiceving noe sallary for the same reason; the ffortt ready to fall about there ears, and had it not bin a little repaired by the cost and charge of said docter, the Generall and rest of the people would not have room to putt there heads in. Haveing given you a full accompt of the state of the Deanes ffort I rest [etc.]"
1372,2,732,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,14/11/1686,Fort,RAC,"This accompanyes the Generall of the Mina, who arrived hear the 9 instant, attended with the Domine and Myne Heer Scheffer. He was received with a greatt deall of respect and civility by the natives, as being hear before [as] a ffactor urged a greatt deall of ffamiliaryty and ffriendship. Last Thursday he invitted mee to his ffortte, where hee made mee harttily welcomee, drunck the King of England [and] Royall Companyes good health, and your Worships continuallity. After this intertaynment, I invitted him to James Ffortt, where as a stranger and in behalfe of the Royall Company I returned him the like civillity, and on Satterday he was invitted to the Deanes ffortt by Myne Heer Luck, who received him and intertained him according to his capacity, att the charge and cost of the docter and others in that ffortt. There your Worships health was drunck before the Generall of the Mina by the said Hans Lucke, as our Company haveing some intrest att that place.
I cannot find any inchroachment was made by the Duch Generall nor anything acted by him to the prejudicall to the Royall Company. His coming heare I find was on noe other accompt then to peruse their Castle, haveing brought itt a recrutte of ffour greatt gunns, a thing mighty well taken of the natives, they being heare of that humor gladder to receive said commoditys then to take any away. He [h]as alsoe ordered severall things to be allterd in this ffortt, and for the security of the Accraaces from Ahennesah, who threaten them dayly, a traangla [= triangular] wall to be build whithout the Castlee with a tancke, that thereby if Ahennesah should come downe to warre them, they might with themselves secure their wiffes and children from him, a thing verry acceptable to the watterside people, butt doubt Ahennessah will not retturne him thankes when he heares of itt. I understand the Generall has sent a Mina Cabusheer with a greatt dashee to Ahennesay, what it is I am not as yett certayne, hope shall fully satisfy your worship per the next. Trade is now verry dull for gold and little better for slaves, which must be expected untill the retturne of the said Ahennesah from the feild, which I hope will not be long, he is dayly expected. I have now by mee upwards of 30 slavees, most men and all Gold Coast. I wrotte your worship last for a ffresh supply of corne, long irons and shortt irons, some staples with nailes of all sortes, hooekes and hinges for windoes and dores, with two greatt staples for the gattes of the Casell [= Castle], lime a great quantity with some tarris and baulkes, alsoe striped broad sattins, pautkaes whitte, a quantity of sayes. I must informe your Worship that I understand that there is a great quantity of gold and slaves at Barracoe. If your worship thinks ffitting I will supply Bryan Ingall with what is sutable for that place, he haveing sent down to mee twice, tould him could not without order from your Worship and Councill, which shall heare per the next."
1373,2,733,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,15/11/1686,Fort,RAC,"I wrote you yesterday by the Duch Generall, then wrotte att large. Since Ahenesah has sent downe for some sayes, haveing none to supply him but what is damaged much. Wee wante alsoe some striped sattins, pautkaes white and course sleetias. Feareing elce the Dutch Generall should make any stay att Corminetene and Morea, made mee send this canoe expresly for said commodity. Ahennesah returns tomorrow from the field to Quomboe whith his army, doe belive will cause a greatt alteration of trade. Alsoe wee stand in need of a quantity of lime and tarris, baulkes, staples, two whereof must bee verry bigg for the Caselle gatte, nailes of all sortte, cartridge paper, alsoe some boards for plattformes for the gunns, the want of them occasions the fflankers to be verry leaky and rott the timber verry much; and for slaves use some corne, long irons and shortte irons. I have now by mee fourty slaves, moste men, which I desire your worship to tacke them up as soone as possible, alsoe to supply us with the above said goods and materialls for the Casell. If any sheets, blacke bafftes, Dutch umbanees, herba longees reed ground, broad tapseeles, read ginghams att Cabo Corsoe, desire your worship to furnish us with them as soone as possible, with those above mentioned. Just now could have sould many sayes but have verry few, which are dameged; desire your worship to furnish as soone as possible with them and all other goods wrott for. By the same convenience will send up my slaves."
1374,2,734,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,20/11/1686,Fort,RAC,"Your worships per the 11 hand canoe have received with the goods therein mentioned, only find one cheste of sheets wanting, the letter expressing six and only five cam to my hands, the canoe men tells mee they received noe more; desire your worship to rectifie itt. I have allsoe received the irons from Hugh Hilling, must desire your worship that when Mr Bailly comes to bringe some along with him, he generally is forced to tacke ours [a]way. According to your worships orders I send noe slaves by this canoe, although I could wish they weare gone, haveing now by mee 54 Negroes slaves, 36 men 18 weomen. I hope itt will not be long are [= ere] the sloope will be down with those goods, vizt more sayes, pautkaes whitte, striped sattins and severall others writt for in my laste; alsoe matterials for the Castle, vizt a good quantity of lime and tarris, deale boards and boards for plattforme for the gunns, also carriges, nailes of all sorttes, hookes, hinges, staples for windoes, whereof two must be verry bigg, being for the Castles gatte. I hope by this time your worship hath received mine of the 14th per the Duch Generall, then wrott att large how affaires went during his stay here, which is the needfull from att present, only wee shall want corne, and are in extreame want of canky stones, here being none to be bought for money."
1375,2,735,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,27/11/1686,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships of the 22d instant with the goods therein mentioned have received. By the same conveniency of the sloope have sent up sixty slaves, 43 men 17 women, being all she could conveniently carry. I beleive affter her dispatch of this cargoe by that time to be ready for her againe. Then desire your worship to send us more necessarys for the repairing the Castle, I desire your Worship to examine Mr Bayly about it, he can give you a ffull accompt how the souldiers houses and two fflankers if not taken up will certainly fall down, may be will doe the white men harm. Also the outward walls want to be plastered; to repaire this wee shall want a great quantyty of lyme and some tarris, baulks, boards and boards for platforme for the gunns. We have not a carridge worth any thing in the Castle. I have bought 20 cockernutt trees, which is not enough, we shall want 60 to repair it all. Here we are forced to pay according to custome one angle a ffathom, so thought it convenient to acquaint your Worship of this affaire, to rectiffie it. As to any goods we want is only pautkeis white.
I have according to order sent up Mr Charles Charles [sic], who during his stay here behaved himselfe very civilly, and did thee people good servis at [= as] to their healths, in his roome Doctor Walber [= in Dr Walber's room]. Your Worship
did not informe what was his, and his two servants pay, which I desire your Worship to inform per next.
I wrote your worship last aboute a chests [sic] which was wanting in the 11 hand cano.
God willing, affter my settlement of the Royall Company's concerns in the hands of Mr Thomas Price, by the 12 next month to be with you.
PS. These irons sent per conveniency went back againe."
1376,2,736,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,01/12/1686,Fort,RAC,"I wrote you last by Mr James Baily, who parted hence the 27 November last with sixty Negro slaves, vizt 43 men 17 women, I hope by this time draws near you. I am almost ready for him againe, haveing now 30, vizt 19 men 11 women, soe desire a discharge of them as soon as possible. As to materialls for the Castle, I referr your Worship to mine of the 27th last month. We want also canky stones, here is none to be had for mony; also more hooks, hinges for windows, with staples to hang padlocks upon; and as for goods we want none but pautkeis white.
Inclosed is my accounts for November, being mk1 7o 7a 7t a, which your worship will receive by bearer. Here is noe trade for gold, I suppose canot be expected before they have discharged themselves of their slaves.
I could buy more slaves then I doe, had I the priviledge as the Dutch to buy them with any sorte of goods as the natives doe desire, for if I will not give it they know where to have itt &ca. The Dutch sent 40 slaves down to Olampo, in order to supply Captain Starr, they being verry scarce there, in a great cano, the said cano spleat in a turnadoe and most of the slaves drownded. As soon as James Bayly comes down and discharges me with these slaves I have by me, which are 30, vizt 19 men 11 women, then please God shall come and pay my respects to your Worship and rest of the Gentlemen. Send us word the price of those narrow stript sattins sent by James Bayly, they seem to be but halfe peices, being but halfe as broad and halfe as long as those broad ones."
1377,2,737,James Nightingale,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,05/12/1686,Fort,RAC,"Att my comeing downe went according to order a board the Anne Sloop and delivered your worships letter to Mr Hilling, who tould me hee had imbark aboutt ten marke in gold. I understand that the Accraies people are intended to fight the Anguinne and Barracoe people by reason they have agreed and permitted the
Dutch [ms. 'ducth'] to putt ashore their flagg and flagstaffe without his [= Ahennisa's] leave; and Ahennisa intends to bringe the whole country under his command and then to have a factory settled and a fort built on accompt of the Royall Company of England and nott suffer the hoogen moogen formerly the poore distressed to predominate in his terrytorys as they have done. Shall not fail to inspect into the Deanes and Dutch [ms. 'Ducth'] actions, also Barracoe, and give your Worship a true relation of all concernes att my returne, and doe beleive that Mr Whiting will come along with me to Cabo Corso, which will bee as speedy as possible wee canne."

In answeare to your last, I wrote your worship by my boy Jack, then wrote what quantite of negroes I had then by mee, vizt 30, 19 men 11 woeman; have now 33 men 12 woemen. As to what quantite shall be eable to purchase in a months tyme, may be 100 or 150, itt is a thinge uncertaine, butt if I had the same priveledge as the Dutch have to give all sorts of goods as demanded, I might encrease the number, for what I refuse to give, they know wheare to have itt, as sheetts, blew purpetuanoes, broad tapseales. I have according to order despatcht the canoe to Hugh Helling with his letter to make noe stay after the delivring of itt. Mr Nightingall and I beegun the inventorying the ware house last Saturday.

As to the condition and statte of their affairs, I leave to Mr Nightingall to give your Worship a full accompte. I have alsoe showed him what is one [sic] reparred at James fforte, that your worship may alsoe have a full satisfaction of the Royall Companyes ffactory. I would had come alonge with him, being [h]indered in expectation of som slaves from Ahenesah which I expect every moment, beside alsoe an answer from my canoe per my boy Jack.

According to your Worships order have shipt on board the Dragon forty six men, twenty one woman, good Gold Coast slaves, twenty five pieces of blew perpetuanoes and three hundred forty six dozen of horn halfted knives by tale, the caskes being bad, all being for account the Royall Company of England.
Since Mr Whiteing departed hence I have had a desperate fitt of the dry gripes which held me for the space of nine dayes, but thank God I am now well recovered, which has been the reason Captain Buttram is so long absent from your Worship, for I had noe rest nor could not send people abroad to look slaves, as I could have done had [it] pleased God to have spared me my health.
According to your Worships order shall not purchase any more slaves except I can have them at seaven peaz men and six women, and those shall be good Gold Coast Negroes. The reason their is no nicconees shipt on board Captain Buttram is they are almost disposed of except thirty seaven, and they shall be disposed of for gold, for they are verry much in request here."
1381,2,741,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,15/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"Your Worships of the 14th instant per the Mary, Captain Richard Gilbert Commander, with one hundred and ffifty broad black bafts came safe to hand, which shall be disposed for the Company[s] best advantage. This goes by via Mina, haveing this opertunity could not let slip to inform your Worship of my arrivall here the 12th instant, w[h]ere I found things in good order but a bad trade for both slaves and gold, which is worst than all. Nothing shall be wanting by me to incourage the same, as also shall do my endeavour to purchase such quant[it]ies of slaves you advise. Your Worship writes I must not barter away such goods as will vend for gold, not for slaves. Was I here without a neibour the thing might be done; besides we shall make noe hand of it, as long as Manuell Burges the Pourtuguez is here giveing more than the price limitted. Here is now in the Castle merchandable Negroes slaves. By next opertunity desire your Worship to furnish us with the following materialls, viz corn, sheat lead, cathridge paper, tar, some planck to mend carriges of guns, and when any sea coale comes also to furnish us with the same, being in sad wantt of lyme. As soon as this month is expired shall send up Mr Price with all my accounts."
1382,2,742,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,01/02/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 29th January came safe to hand, and in order to advise what slaves might be procured in a months time in these parts, it is a thing I canot absolutely resolve, the trade now being so dull for that sort of commodity, canot give you the least encouragement immaginable, haveing bought but one man since my last to you. I might had procured somewhat more, which for want of giveing them the goods demanded, being contrary to your last orders to part with any such, where [= were] carried another way. I wrote you last to this point and unless we have the same liberty as others we can make no hand of it. We have nither sheets nor blew perpetuanoes, which sort of goods are most in demand for slaves. We could had disposed those perpetuanoes that were ordered up for slaves. If any pautkeis white pray send us a quantity, and more sayes. I will do my best endeavour to comply with your desires. In order to it I will send up to Ahenesah. I suppose you have not heard since my comeing down he made the Accras pay him 24 sayes, at first he demanded forty bendys, for offering the Anguinas their servis to assist them against him the time he was out against Occrepon. Barracoe we expect dayly the rueing [= ruin] of that place, and all the people to be put to the sword. Ahenesah has taken a fittish to doe it, also has ordered Fanteen people with corn, his intention shortly is for Anguina, in the intrim waits the proceedings of the Anguinas against Accron.
This accompanyes Mr Thomas Price with November, December and January accompt, with the ballance of December and January. The ballance of December is 7oz 12a 4ta and January is 1m 4oz 13a 6ta, trade being so dull that we take hardly mony to defray charges of the Castle. I wrot last for some sea coals. We are dayly procuring shells, doe not question but to gett enough to supply our occasions. I must inform your Worship that Dr Walbor humbly petitions for his wages to be paid, him being due since August last, about the 2d ditto, he being willing to find medicines for the use of the Castle, in consideration further desires that his wages might be advanced to 25 1b [= 25] per anno more than his agreement with the Company, being 36 1b per anno.
Also one John Bell, his time being expired, humbly pettitions your Worship to goe home. We want more nailes, some planck. I have received 21 chests of corn from Hugh Hilling. I have ordered him to buy more. Here is a matter of 10 chests of corn which came from Annamaboe in Mr Nightingales time, not worth hoggs eating, what to doe with it I know not."

Trade is very dull both for slaves and gold. We here that Ahenesah is going to make pease with Arcanies, if so, am in hope will mend. Here is yesterday arrived a Jamaica sloope and a Dutch interloper. Captain Crookshanks parted hence the ninth innstant. We are now ready for coals to burn oystershells. We want also nailes of all sorts, hooks and staples, also bolts and some tar, some sheat lead."
1384,2,744,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,18/02/1687,Fort,RAC,"I wrote you last the 12 instant by the Dutch factor. Fearing least he should make any stay at Cormanteen or Morea, thought ffit to advise, as per order of yours of the 12th ditto by Mr Elwes, what goods and materialls were wanting at this place, which are as inclosed noat. As to slaves, shall endeaver to procure what I can that is good at the old price. I have now by me thirty very good; had I had those goods now write for, might have had a greater quantity. I could wish the coals for burning oystershells might be with us speedily, before the ill conveniency of the rains arrives, elce will prevent our design, and what goods I now write for send as soon as possible."
1385,2,745,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,01/03/1687,Fort,RAC,"My last to you was the 26th February last by the opertunity of a cano bound to windward. Then wrot you the needfull. One [= once] more must inform your worship that unless we are supplyd with corn from windward speedily, we shall be much necessitated for want of the same. The natives here stands so much in need of it, that they will buy it from your Worship; are dayly at me to write to you to send down a sloop loaden, and for these oystershells which now have bought would have faine been paid with it also, which I could not spare haveing upwards of 60 Negroe slaves in the Castle, which I wish had a discharge of them, haveing but a small quantity of corn left.
PS. This accompanyes my February accompt with the ballance thereof, being mk0
7oz 6a 2ta. Here is no trade for gold and very little for slaves. We want nicconees broad, and some tarr, allso those goods and materialls wrote for formerly, not forgetting a speedy supply of corn."
1386,2,746,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,05/03/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours by the 17 hand cano came safe to hand, with the goods and materialls therein mentioned, only ten deal boards the letter expresseth to have sent are not, which we want much, more sheets, and stayes to keep open the windows, about two foot and a half long. The yambs [= yams] shall charg in my account; must inform your Worship, most of them are very bad and small, and some not fitt to eat. By this conveniency goes 45 Negroes slaves, 30 men 15 women, some of them are resolute ffellows, haveing diged thee prison wall in one nights time, being six foot thick, three foot and a halfe through; after have bin prevented of the same, made their attempt to cut us off. You will also receive the irons along with them, which desire your Worship to send them back by my boy Jack, we wanting them much. This accompanys John Bell, who I know nothing to the contrary but hath performed his duty in all particular; and as to Doctor Walber I have informed him what your Worship wrote, who answers he will find medicines for the Castles use, as occasion serves so will bring them to account (if used) either every month or halfe year. Desire your Worship to send two more long irons, for Castle slaves, some of them haveing made their attempt to run away. Doctor Walber demands his wages, I know not to what time it is due, nither do I know what he hath a month for sallery and dyett, so desire your Worship to inform per next, or when your Worship pleases."
1387,2,747,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,14/03/1687,Fort,RAC,"The occasion of this cano, is cheifly our great necessity of corn, haveing little left in the Factory; moreover our great want of more sheets, broad nicconees, broad stript sattins, pautkeis white (if any). Here the Dutch vend a great deal of corn at 3 angles per chest. Ahenesah desires your Worship to send down a great quantity of the same, he will allow the same price; so will the Accra people, who are dayly at me to write you to that point, and when your worship sends sheets send a greater quantity then useuall, those that came last per Captain Bristow are vended, the Dutch haveing none. As for materialls for the Castle now wanting are deal boards, long irons, and those short irons sent per the great cano with the slaves; also we are much necessitated for carridges for the gunns, haveing not one ffitting for use in the Castle, which am ashamd to lett strangers look on them.
Must inform your Worship the Doctor desires his sallery. What [h]is agreement is with the Company both for sallery and dyett each month I know not. nither from what time due. As to his medicines I wrote your Worships his
answer in my last, which hope your Worship will answer per this return. Excuse my ill writeing, being much incommoded with the great paine of dry belly ack, which has hold me violently this 3 dayes.
Captain Bristow went hence last Satterday, being very ill. The goods and coals came safe ashore. I desire your worship to send us the corn as soon as possible, with the goods and materialls wrote for before and those above."

For may it please your Worship, we have been near upon three dayes togather without any victualls or sustinance but water, and then makeing our case known to Mr Whiting, our master for some time [gave us] a taccoe a day betwixt us, but now may it please your Worship, fish not comeing ashore, we have for this great while had nothing but water and a little canky, and when we told him we could gett nothing he told us he brought us over for a cacrifise, and when meer hunger, for who can endure its sharpness, forced us to go to him day by day for our taccoe, he would beat us, and bid us gett victuall where we could, for he would give us nothing, so that now [he] detaining all things from us we did againe complayn to Mr Whiteing and [he] haveing wrought what he could with our master can gett nothing but that we are his servants and he will allow us what he pleaseth  whereupon Mr Whiteing hath ordered [us] to petition your Worship, upon whose order and the sharpness of extream hunger we have taken upon us the bouldness to prevent [= present] your Worship with this our humble petition, beging and humbly beseeching your Worship for the sake of allmighty God to look upon the mesery of poor victims. If there be any fault in us we humbly submitt our selves to your Worships sensure, only we beg that we may not die a sacrifice to our masters rage, by the insupportable of hunger [sic], and may the Great God deliver your Worship from all evill and make you happy here and hereafter."

for them according to their desire att Cabo Corso, have given an account to your Worship for laying out the mony before, and here will be judged by your Worship, and little say to what petition or complaint your Worship and the rest of the Gentlemen is troubled with from them or there consorts here. Was it from any honest gentleman it would much troble me. According to order doe send them to your Worship and rest of the Gentlemen to take care better then I have done for dureing the tyme they are to stay in the Royall Affrican Company servis here in Guinee, which was very well done, which for what servis I have had of them might have come before, and humbly give you many thankes for the great care and trouble, wish that I could studdy one way to reward it. Shall likewise doe my endeavour to give sattisfaction to Mr Whiteing that there be no complaint made otherwise about me in the Castle.
Understand that an order is given for my sallery at 36 per anno according to agreement made at home, for which I humbly return you many thanks. Likewise for my dyett at 24 per anno, which is not according to agreements made at home with the Royall Affrican Company and allowed before the Commander and the Courte, to have dyett at your Worships table, otherwise to have 50 per anno for dyett, and one servant, which agreement brought with Captain Andrew Brandfeill, under Mr Jacob Heatly's one [= own] hand to your Worship; the coppy Mr Stanton has, which I hope will give sattisfaction to your Worship and the rest of the Gentlemen of the Councell."

As to their sallery have not paid any, leaveing it to your Worship. Your Worship writes 8 angles a month to said Doctor dyett, when he most assuredly pretends his agreement with the Company to be 50 per anno; I have not paid him any nor shall not untill I have a more fuller sattisfaction, which I hope may be per next. I must also inform your Worship that the 1000 yambs sent by this conveniency, most of them are not fitting for hoggs, and those that are good are extraordinary small. I have sent you per ditto one hundred and eighteen allejars, and seaventy broad black bafts in 3 cases, being
good [but] not of the right sort. I would had wrought you by him, then being very weak; I have had a hard bout of it, now thank God I am upon the recovery. The two whitemen souldiers came safe to hand, shall pay them their sallary according to order. We are extreamly in want of a good man for a serjant, which if your Worship could spare us such a one will doe us a great kindness.
Now as to the Allegator sloop, I have not as yett taken anything out of her, just now being arrived. In answer as to yours of ditto concerning carridges for gunns, the dementions are as followeth: 2 carridges for small seaker and for half a dozen minion. I could wish your Worship would exchange half a dozen facon and faconnett for halfe a dozen long seaker, which if your Worship is willing, at the recept of the other, if you send them or others pray send carridges with them, then shall send the other in their roome; it will doe us a great kindness and will grace the Castle, the Dutch haveing lately exchanged their small gunns, have placed most against us. Also must desire your Worship to supply us with all materialls belonging to them, as spunges, ladles &ca. We want also cathridge paper. As to what your Worship mentions concerning oyster shells they are very scarce here, haveing none but what we pick out of the salt ponds, being hardly enough to supply our occasions.
The rains being so upon us shall referr burning any till after they are over. The corn now sent shall doe for the best. I have now by me 20 slaves, shall send them by the Allegator sloope. Send us more sheets and broad nicconees. James Bayly went hence the 22 instant."

He sent then two women full of the small pox (which are in the number), the one dyed in the voyage coming up, the other shall take all care possible to restore her to health, I examined his canoemen whether the slaves on board were most men or women, they replyed he never bought women without men. He may be I judge half way between Olampo and here by the time of his departure, which was the 18th instant. The land breezes are far out and last not long, which will make his passage long ere he turn up. According to his desire have sent by his canoe four chests of the best corn in the Castle, and have gave him accompt of what you were pleased to order in yours. If he want any sort of goods for the purchasing more slaves he was to be supplyed here, taking his receipt for the same, and what slaves he should purchase hereafter not to dispose of any without your positive orders. Gentlemen, yours makes mencon of twenty pair of short irons and five long ditto, but have received none. The slaves that have been purchased since the departure of Mr Mark Bedford Whiting are fourteen men and twelve women, good slaves. The irons wee stand in great need of, having but one pair to spare.

I also received his slaves from him, being all 59, so that he has left us some thing threadbare with goods and plenty with slaves, having upward of one hundred and odd slaves in the Castle. I could wish a speedy delivery of them, which I hope you Gentlemen will effect as soon as possible, expecting your orders for the same, which when perused shall follow in all particulars. Wee are mightily put by of late by the Dutch, whose fresh supply of all sorts of goods proves a great hindrance to us and drawes the natives from our procuring what [ms 'wth'] we desire. I have here inclosed a note of our wants; I know sundry sorts of them are not by you, being only to give you an insight, but what is with you pray send, it will be a great means in provoking a trade, which endeavours shall not be wanting by me in any wise. Wee also stand in need cartridge paper and all sorts of things belonging to the gunners stores, some rivetts and forelocks for the slaves irons, likewise two clinch hammers, two cold chissells, two punches, and for the repairing of the Castle, the rains having been so furious as you are sensible has occasioned much damage, a bricklayer would be very necessary here, especially to arch the gate, having only a Negroe to help us, who understands no such worke.
I shall follow also your desires as to my monthly accompts, which shall be sent up as possible. James Bayly made his return this morning for Olampo. If he should want any more goods as per inclosed wee have not wherewithall to supply him, therefore once more desire you to furnish us with what you have of the said contents as possible. Our people some of them are very bad in health, most especially our Doctor. I hope God will restore them their health again.
[PS] A ship in sight, suppose to be Captain Thompson.
[PPS] The Dutch expect a ship every day out of Holland, which ship Monsieur Depalmas is ordered (when she comes) for Olampo to procure slaves. The factor here is providing for her in the interim."
1399,2,759,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,10/07/1687,Fort,RAC,"I wrote last the 8th instant and then advised you in full of what goods and materialls were wanting. This goes by the return of Mr Elwes his canoe, and serves to acquaint that wee shall very speedily want corn, having but 60 chests remaining. James Bayly has had at times in all forty chests. Has also left us very bare in goods, in so much that for want of the same our neighbour fares the better. This I thought fitt to advise you.
[PS] My most humble service to the Agent."
1400,2,760,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,17/07/1687,Fort,RAC,"This canoe is occasioned up by reason the master of the sloop just now arrived hath forgott his invoyce and other things, I suppose writes to you by this oppertunity in order to send them down by the bearer, he staying here till the return of the same. Captain Gould arrived here last Thursday and went away last night, by him received the goods you sent. I am sorry must inform you that he was forced to carry one of the great gunns to Alampo to be putt on board James Bayly. Our nine hand canoe (here being no other to be had) by the carriage of the other three splitt in 2 peeces, all the great shott drowned, so that now wee shall want others and a new great canoe. I have comply'd with all your orders and putt on board him ninety one negroes, 49 men, 42 women, as per inclosed bills of lading appears. I was in hopes by this sloop to be supplyed with goods and materialls wrote for in mine of the 8th past. I am still procuring of slaves. The same have advised James Bayly, now to leeward. Pray also furnish us with corn, which wee shall want very speedily.
[PS] Mr Price presents his most humble service to you all. He is left with me."
1401,2,761,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,27/07/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours by the 11 hand canoe is received with the iron barrs and matterialls for the Castles use. I am sorry you have not sheetes, blew, red and green perpetuanoes, and sayes, which goods are all in demand. When any by you pray send them as soon as possible. Since my last to you arived here James Baily with 48 negroe slaves. Having now almost one hundred of them in the Castle, by reason corne is here so scarce and non to be procured for money, refuse the buying any more unless you could procure mee the same provition. Now they are to be had, perhaps when you want they cannot be obtained. I could have wished James Bayly could have made a trip up with all his now procured. I have putt the thing to him, whose answer is that his orders runn to the contrary, being to lye here till further orders from you, which I hope will be for him to come up with them. On[e] of the great gunns is on board him, as wrote you before. Here is noe probability of getting her out of the sloope without necessaryes as now he writtes you, for the same might have been ashoare with the rest, our canoe sayfed [= saved] and all the shott, had not Captain Gould shown his tarpauling breeding in not being so good as his word, not assisting us with any manner of things for that use. I suppose you heare the Danes are furnished with goods, alsoe that the Duch Companyes ship that is to slave from the Co[a]st is now arived, news is sent down to Alampoe in order for her dispatch. Pray send us word as soon as possible what your intention is, then shall follow what you shall direct. I humbly beg your pardons for not informing you of the death of William Fisher, itt was my intention soe to doe but in hast forgott itt. His things shall send up by the sloope. Mr Halford is very ill, fear his childessness and fearefullness in his sickness will bring him to the same end very suddenly. Shall informe you further per next, which will be 5 dayes hence, with my months accompts."
1402,2,762,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,02/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"I wrot you last per the 11 hand canoe, then wrott you of the scarcity of corne. This alsoe serves to informe you of the same, none being to be had here in these parts. There is now remaining in the Factory not above 30 chests, and at the expence of three in 2 dayes for 94 negroes slaves now in the Castle, which I would desire a speedy delivery of them. I have desisted buying any more [i.e. slaves] untill further orders, which I hope will be by the retturne of this att furthest. Slaves presents dayly more then usuall. Perhaps now are to be had; when you want them are not to bee gott.
I must informe you that of the 136 chests corne sent to this place per the Alligattor Sloope eighteen chests of the same was damaged, being not fitting for hoggs, as per the inclosed attestation doth appeare. By the same goes my monthly accompts for June and July, the ballance for both being 2mk 1o 9a 1ta. The same have not sent you, your former orders being to the contrary of sending any gold in a two hand canoe, but by vessells or other conveniencys more secure. Here has been noe trade this two months for gold, Ahenesah having stopt the way for the Arkins comeing downe. The goods wanting are sheets, blew and redd perpetuanoes, sayes. Our neighbour the Duch has been well supplyed of latte with those sorts of goods, draws trade from us, alsoe buys great quantity's of slaves. The great ship is dayly expected downe from the Mina in order to goe downe to Alampoe, Mr Lapalma merchant.
James Bayly wrott you gentellmen for necessaryes to gett the gunn of [= off] the sloope. He has bin here ever since my last, expecting an order what to doe. I hope you will order him up with those slaves now in the Factory, for I cannot keep them much longer without a suply of provitions. Mr Halford continews still verry ill, still sometimes is like a distracted man and other times speakes verry rationable; wants for nothing what this place affords. I am doubtfull of his recovery, God help him."
1403,2,763,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,04/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"The foregoeing was intended you, but your cannoe coming just as mine was departing put a stop to it. By the retturne of the same, is to sattisfie you that according to your order shall dispatch James Bayly with what slaves he can conveniently carry, which believe may be 60. I am sorry you cannot suply us with corne. Wee shall be forced to put on board the sloope the major part [sc. of corn] now remaining; having tacken well, as tould you before, will not goe halfe soe farr as better, which makes the expence of corne the greater, and for the maintenance of those slaves remaining after Mr Bayly have taken the said complement, will be about thirty, what to doe for them I know not, here being no manner of provitions for their substenance, unless wee buy fish and give them halfe allowance in caneky.
Gentelmen you write I must doe my utmost indeavours to procure what Negroe slaves I can that are good. Lett mee have provitions to keep them after bought, the thing will be easily donn, and had the Sloope binn suplyed (and myselfe ashoare) with the same might have had two hundred or more then already bought, they coming to saile every day more then usuall. This will prove a great hindrance to the Mary you mention is to be slaved of.
The three hand canoe you mention James Baily is in hopes of a better in his passing up. As to William Fishers things, shall send up by him, soe referring you till then."
1404,2,764,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,08/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"This accompanies James Bayly in the Adventure Sloop, by whome you will receive the ballance for my two last months accompts for both, being 2mk 1oz 9a 1ta. Alsoe goes by him sixty negroe slaves, vizt 30 men, 30 women, with water, corne and other necessaryes I hope may be sufficient for their passage up. For the remayning parrt of the Negroes, I know not what to do, having only 14 chests of corne for their substenance, which is very bad. I have for a considerable time, as wrote you before, refused the buying any more slaves, which will prove a great disappointment to the Mary; now being to be had and not to be bought. Here is no trade with us, I have not taken one angle this tenn days, the Dutch being supplyed with our wants draws all from our ffactory. Their ship is dayly expected, all provition made for her dispatch. I would have sent you according to order William Ffishers things. Mr Bayly could not take them in. Mr Halford is yett sick, nobody knows his distemper, he is not himselfe, continually raving mad, talks at random, his discourse always about his wife and children in Europe. In this condition hath layn this two or three days, what to thinke of him I know not, he hath no ffeavour, nor any burning (God mend him).
If you could spare us a bricklayer for a finall time with some bricks to arch the gate, you would do a great kindnesse. Wee want also deale boards, small balkes, nailes of all sorts."
1405,2,765,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,09/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"This accompanyes the sad news of the death of Mr William Halford, who departed this life aboutt 3 this morning. I have not as yett taken an accompt of his things, only have secured them untill the dispatch of this canoe, which I though[t] fitt to send her wthout delaying of time. I buryed him as becomes one of his station.
The following is a coppy of a letter sent you by the Adventure Sloope, James Baily Master, who had his dispatch yesterday morning. By reason wind would not permitt could not stir. By him goes the ballance of my two last accompts, makeing in all mk2 1o 9a 1ta, and the quantity of sixty negroe slaves, vizt 30 men, 30 weomen, with all things convenient for their passage up, which hope may prove sufficient. For the remaning part of the negroes our provitions is verry shortt, haveing butt 14 chests of damaged corne for their substinance. I have for some time (for want of the same) refused the buying any more [i.e. slaves], which thing I feare will prove a great disapointment to the Marys slaveing off the Coast. Now are to be had, but not to be bought. Here is noe trade for gould, I have not taken one angle this tenn dayes; the Ducth [sic] being supplyed with our wants draws all from us. Their ship from the Mina is dayly expected down in order to her dispatch. Wee have lost more slaves of the small pox. One was this day from James Baily, being newly taken with the same."
1406,2,766,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,23/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours by the 17 hand canoe, with sixty iron barrs and 25 chests of corne (as you mention), in measuring itt (in very small chest) made butt 23. I am sorry you have none of those goods I advised for, it is a greatt hindrance to mee, although trade is now verry dead; whatever gold or slaves comes goes all to the Duch, for sheets, sayes, blew and green perpetuanoes, I see none inquire for any other. Here will bee noe probability of a currant negotiation, as longe as Ahennasah and Arkins are att variance. My endeavor ever was and ever shall bee forward to promote the companyes intrest, and this month will prove worse than laste, doe not take wherewith to defray charges (and which is worst of all) not able to pay soldiers there sallary due to them since the 5th June. What to doe in this case I know not, butt waite with patience in hopes of better times. I shall comply with your orders concerning Mr William Halfords things, all he left being verry inconsiderable. You have here inclosed an inventory for your perusall, another of the same I have sent to Mr Wight. If possible of any saile shalle send him and you a true and faithfull accompt, our people being here soe out of money for want of their pay, that I feare noe good will come on't. I wrot last for a bricklayer and some brickes for the gatte and gunn ports, a thing verry necessary to be donn. Wee want allsoe some nailes of all sorts, a few baulkes, deale boards, all these matterialls I hope will not be wanting.
James Baylye is about the Great Divells Hill. I feare his voyage up will be longer than usuall, the current running verry strong to leward."
1407,2,767,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,23/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"Just now arrived this inclosed from the Generall of the Deanes, Mynheer Hans Luke, in order to be sent you as per superscription. In this canoe goes twelve cows, whereof six belonges to you, the rest are the king of Fettues (purchased by his man). They are very ordinary and all he could procure. I have marked yours with a string on their legg, that you may distinguish yours from his, or Hoockomee knows them from the rest. The Portuguez is gon to leeward to Mounsieur Lapallma, there to follow such orders as he shall direct, being no possibility of turning to windward."
1408,2,768,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,02/09/1687,Fort,RAC,"This accompanyes my accompt for August. You will find the ballance to be unconsiderable, and trade very dull. Ahennasah stiring abroad makes us soe backward in these parts, as currant negosiation cannot be expected as long as he is att variance with the uplanders. Now is goeing next month to fight the remaining part of Anguynas. It may prove good as to slaves, which are now scarce, either they goe to leeward on board the Dutch Companyes ship (for those supplyes we have not) ore elce none comes downe.
Inclosed is an accompt of the disposall of Mr William Halford's things. An other of the same have sent Mr Rice Wight, to whome shall send the product of the same when opertunity presents of sending the ballance of those inclosed. I am sorry those goods wrote for formerly are not yett arived. In my last I wrote alsoe for matterialls for Castles use, vizt nailes of all sorts, some balkes deale boards, some breakes [= bricks] and old planckes of shipping (when broak up), which for want of the same to put under the gunns [we] use more lime be half then if otherwise, not forgetting some great iron wedges, for splitting of cockernut trees, as alsoe a great iron maule, two cold chisills, a clinch hammer, and two punches, for slaves use. I have now taken up the soldiers roome, and placed the gatte in the middle. By degrees the Castle will be in good repaire, and if keept soe, and not lett things runn to ruine before they are mended, as formerly donn, itt will not prove hereafter soe expensive to the Company to accomplish the same. Wee shall want more cockernut trees, and what shall be donn on this affaire shall be managed as to as little charge as possible to the Company."
1409,2,769,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,12/09/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 10th instant came safe to hand with the things therein mentioned. Since understanding a vessell is arrived you from Europe, occasions this canoe's going up to informe you off our wants of the severall sorts of goods and materialls for Castles us, as per inclosed. If any arrived, you will be pleased to furnish us with the same, by the sloop or other convenciencyes.
As to the purchasing of slaves I refuse none that come that are good, although now are very scarce. Our being not supplyed as per note is a great hinderance. The Dutch Company shipp of which you write is not very forward, having bought but 90 since her being at Olampo, which with 104 received from their ffactory here is 194 now on board her. God knows after this rate how long she may be purchasing her complement of 600.
Your letter to Doctor Walber have delivered. It is grat satisfaction to me you know him, and no wonder he'l abuse me (as he hath don), as long as he doth to his and my betters, from whom he hath received more kindness than deserved. It is not long some time past he struck one of the Company slaves, the most necessary man in the Castle, a carpenter, with an iron shovell, wounded him on the side insomuch that the blood came from his mouth. After having comitted the same error, and having given him a small reproband [= reprimand] for so doing, did desire him to see him cured, [he] would not but most inhumanely replyed if he dyed could but pay for him, an answer not fitting to give me. This is the very reason of the falling out betwixt him and me, and upon that accompt turned him from my table or presence. I had sent him up some time past, had he not sent me the submission inclosed, acknowledging in order in a future amendment. I wonder he should write you to depart this place, when it is plainly appeared his inclination is to the contrary. This is like his abuseing me behind my back, but in my hearing in company [with] the soldiers a thing he denied, but ass sure to be true. What shall I say, he is a man of two tongues.
As to his difference with Mr Price, I have called them both to accompt, being for past quarrels betwixt them, when I was up at Cabo Corso, but now renewed. I cannot understand the right, for one says one thing, the others says another, and for my part I have not reason to beleive one of them, being very well satisfied is a great lyer. I must advise you that the Danes have inquired for an answer of their letter per the 17 hand canoe. The Generall is very sick of a fflux, and in danger of his life. There is great liklyhood to be warr betwixt Ahenesa and the Anguinas. I wish they would fight and make an end, I am sure they spoyle the trade. Having not else, only desire to be furnished if possible with those goods and materialls, staying for them, being things much wanted towards the repayring the Castle."
1410,2,770,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,19/09/1687,Fort,RAC,"This serves to accompany the sad news of the Deans Generall who departed this life this day at three in the afternoone of a fflux, I thought fitt to advise you thereof knowing the Royall Company has concerns in your hands, also that you direct yourself accordingly. This day am invited tomorrow with the Dutch ffactor to go to his buriall. Per next shall advise you further.
Your letter by James Bayly just came to hand. Those things sent by him are not as yet landed, You have omitted 2 pit [= pick] axes, tarr and tarris, the most necessary things wee wanted in repayring the Castle, which wee are now compleating with all speed. As to goods I hope you will consider us as soone as possible. I wonder what James Bayly can do to leward, there being a shipp there supplyed with all sorts and makes no hand of it. Some days agoe passed another of the same bound for Ardra. having been six months from Europe, missing his intended port went round about, his people all much [blank].
Trade is still very dull, occasioned as advised you [by] Ahenesa being not contented. What comes down is for sheets, say's, perpetuanoes blew & green. Having not else, in hast."
1411,2,771,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,24/09/1687,Fort,RAC,"Having this oppertunity of a Mina canoe bound to windward and thought fitt to informe you that those tapseils you intended on board James Bayly for broad prove all narrow, and his long cloths very course, worse than usuall. He is gon to leward to little purpose, and wee here being in want of those goods wrote for do little mend the matter. I have in one of my last inclosed you a note, and to supply with the same if possible per first conveniency. The corne sent per the Sloop being measured aboard by your owne chest wants three. Slaves are still very scarce.
Desire you Gentlemen to informe me per next, how the soldiers and other people are paid at Cabo Corso, which at present I am ignorant of.
I am at present much indisposed with a violent tenasmus, makes me faint and weak, for that reason having kept my bed this three days. Begging your pardon for my ill writing."
1412,2,772,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,26/09/1687,Fort,RAC,"This serves only to accompany the inclosed from James Bayly, which is in reference of what I wrot you yesterday, that there is a mistake of goods putt on board him (narrow tapselees, for broad). Wee can doe noe good here, nor he to leward, unless wee were supplyed accordingly. This goes by an Annamaboe canoe, and thought fitt to send you word I am still much undisposed."
1413,2,773,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,30/09/1687,Fort,RAC,"This accompanyes my September accompt with the ballance thereof, alsoe that of August past, which alsoe had been with you sooner, had I not been in expectation of the great canoe comeing downe with those supplys you mentioned in your last, not as yett in sight, hope will not be long. James Bayly is still to leeward, waiting the same motion. Slaves are now very scarce and trade very bad. The Dutch companys ship has but 300 negroes now on board. Monseuir Delapalma is now come up here in a canoe, being tired out with the dullness of that negotiation. I wrote you last to know how the soldiers and and other people are paid at Cabo Corsoe. I understand it's otherwise than 4 per ounce. I have offered the same to them, will not take itt, soe desire your order that I may show them, which will give further sattisfaction.
By the bearer you will alsoe receive 6a 7ta, being what William Lawrance owed formerly in the celler.
Inclosed is a noate from our our gunner, being what things are wanting for the gunns, which wee stand much in need off. Alsoe have sent you a noate of moneys owing him, from the gunner deceased with you."
1414,2,774,John Bloome,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,05/10/1687,Fort,RAC,"This is to advise you of my arrivall here, where I shall as circumspectly as possible observe yours and Mr Whitings commands, and shall always indeavor to comport my selfe soe well that noebody shall have a just complaint against me.
This I doe promise, and will by the help of God performe, of which you may be pleased to rest ashured. I am very much oblidged to you for all your kindesses and readyness to serve me, which alsoe injoyne a double obligation on me. Your favors have been soe great, that I shall never know how to recompence 'em but by an obedient observance of your commands. I kiss your hands."
1415,2,775,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,07/10/1687,Fort,RAC,"The inclosed was intended you before but the bearer coming put a stop to it, by whom wee have received the goods mentioned. One of the bales of broad tapseiles I put on board James Bayly, then being at Tisha, from whome wee have received on shoare twenty six negroes, vizt fourteen men, twelve weomen slaves. Now is gon down to purchase more. The bale on board him which proves to be narrow tapseiles, was not India packt, neither was there as he says any packers noat, being a repackt bale. I am fully sattisfied are true narrow ones. I take notice you write of none of the umbanees to be disposed but for gold. You cannot expect to vend them for the same, they always was leeward goods, its those people that buys them. A great quantity of those you send now last are damaged, as may easily be perceived, the bales haveing been much rubbed. Captain Thomas Towers is here at the Deans ffortt. This day sent for me to have some discourse (of I know not what). The dispatch of this canoe hinders my goeing, soe cannot as yett give an accompt of his proceedings. By this canoe goes Docter Walber, whose dayly abuse, and finding noe alteration of amendment, which is against his promise, I have made bold to cause his removall, which I hope you Gentellmen will not be against, hopeing I make the exchange of a worse for a better, and not long are [= ere] I am supplyed with him.
PS. Dr Wolber is paid to the 5th June, his dyett to the 5th August 1687. You mention a caske of tarr, by this canoe none cam to hand, only tarris."
1416,2,776,Thomas Price,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,15/10/1687,Fort,RAC,"Since I understand the Royall Company will have none intrusted in your affaires of negotiation but those that they approve off, and have entred security, I humble make my request to you Gentlemen that you would be pleased to consider me, and put me in such an imploy as you shall adjudge not prejudicale to your selfs. Shall willingly imbrace any thing I deserve. You know Mr Halford, whome God was pleased to take away, was sent downe to take the warehouse, a thing then in my charge, now Mr Bloome at present, and [I] destitute of any buisiness, would not willingly be idle, but am still and ever was ready to serve my masters the Royall Affrican Company, it being my duty, as alsoe to obey your comannds, soe that I depend my selfe wholly upon you and refer to your next."
1417,2,777,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,16/10/1687,Fort,RAC,"Meeting with a two hand canoe bound up to your portt, was glad of the oppertunity, hopeing by this time the Ffrancis may be with you. Our wants of the severall sorts of goods I wrote for, you have before you. The sheets sent last I wrote you are all disposed for gold. As to the umbanees I wrote you at large, only must informe you that in those two bales wanted five pieces, vizt in no. 181 wanted one, and in no. 182 wanted four. I could not find any packers noate in any of them. An attestation for the same shall be sent up at the months end. Corne wee shall want very speedily, haveing upward of ninety negroe, slaves in the Castle. Yesterday received a letter from James Bayly, who writes can doe noe good to leeward, as long as the Dutch Companys shipps says lasteth, all the men slaves goeing on board him for the same. It's the same here with us, now the sheets are gonn, wee stand still, and much inquires alsoe for says and perpetuanoes. Send us alsoe some more markt iron barrs.
I must desire you Gentlemen to supply us also with two lusty man Ardra slaves. Those few wee have here are imployed in makeing mortar and swish, and others burning of lime, soe that wee want a couple to fetch wood. When the Castle is finished and all worke done (haveing now abundance to doe) shall be retturned you againe, for if wee imploy other other slaves wee are in danger of looseing them. The gunners stores as per his note desire the same, and the tarr you mention never came to hand. If any balks, deale boards, pray send us, haveing great occasion for them, more especially for the prisons doores, which are not over secure, and alsoe slitt deale for to fitt a new nine hand canoe. I have according to your orders put the Searjant you sent downe in his office. You have not informed mee his pay. I wrote you last about the soldiers pay and other matters, which desire an answer. The Dutch Company shipp hath lost 20 negroes and one white man of the small pox.
PS. I am sorry to heare of the death of Agent Bradley and alsoe Mr Bucknells att Succondee."
1418,2,778,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,23/10/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 18th instant with six chest of sheets and an barrell of tarr came safe to hand. This accompanys a two hand canoe bound to Annamaboe. The letters to the Deans copeman have sent him, as alsoe that of [= to] James Bayly, whom I expect here every moment. When arrived, shall follow what you have directed. I am sorry you have noe gunners stores, especially carriages for the gunns, a thing harde to be got out of shipping, alsoe whole deale and slitt deale. As soone as possible desire a supply of bricks to to compleat the arching of eighteen gunn ports, verry nececessary to be donn, for want of the same our worke is behind hand. The markt iron barrs, corne, and rum, with those balks you mention, send us alsoe. I am sorry the Ffrances is not yett in hearing, I doubt much his safety."

1421,2,781,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,04/11/1687,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys the Alligottor Sloop with forty negroe slaves, vitz 18 men, 22 woemen. The goods sent by her have received. The bricks are not a quantity enough, so desire a greater quantity. James Bayley left this place about four days agoe, with sixteen men, fourteen weomen, besides what others he had on board makes up fifty six. The carriages of the gunns the dimentions shall informe you by Mr Price, who departs two days hence. The great gunn on board the Adventure Sloop send us, wee want him. The sheets sent are all disposed, so want more. If any goods arrived as wrote you formerly send us alsoe, with the iron wedges and iron worke wrote you for. You will receive per the bearer William Fishers things, the inventory and what is due to him shall ffollow by Mr Price."
1422,2,782,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,07/11/1687,Fort,RAC,"I wrote you last by the Alligatorr Sloop, then advised you the needfull. This accompanies Mr Thomas Price, who comes up to offer his service to you, tending to his further employ. By him goes my October accompt with its ballance, being 5oz 0a 4ta, also the inventory of William Ffishers, with an attestation for goods wanting in the two bales of phota longees, per the 17 hand canoe. As for carriages for the guns, and other materialls wanting, the bearer can informe you."
1423,2,783,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,12/11/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours by the Ann Sloop came safe to my hand. Being late have not as yet taken any thing out of her, but thought fitt to answer yours by Monsieur de La Palma. To what you mention concerning the charges in my last accompt, I can assure you, there is nothing brought to accompt, but what was necessary, and hath duly been paid, as may be maid appear; as also those slaves in sallary which you are displeased at, I know of none but what have been allowed the same since my taking charge. If you are pleased to peruse my former accompts you will find the same, and to be without them is a thing impossible. In answer to those that we sent up to you in both the sloops, I acknowledge none but those that went in the Alligator, for those sixteen men, fourteen women were those that were put ashore by James Bayly, and so returned him againe, but a slave may be well to day and sick tomorrow, they are subject to mortallity as well as whites. However I mind what you advise, so shall follow. The Dutch Company shipp is gon from Alampo, with 504 Negroes. The remayns of her cargo were all put ashore here, being sheets, says, and fine sletias. It hath been a great hinderance to those says you sent last, the Blacks esteeming theirs better than ours. I find you do not approve off our arching the batlements, I shall give you a satisfactory accompt by next for my so doing. In the interim, excuse my ill writing, being in hast."
1424,2,784,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,21/11/1687,Fort,RAC,"This retturnes the Ann Sloop, per whome you will receive twelve Negroe slaves, vizt six men and six woemen, with one weoman more which I put on board for a canky woeman, in all thirteen. I put all necessarys sufficient for their passage up. I wrote you last by Monseiur Delapalmo per him [sic] in answer of what you wrote me by the bearer, per whom I received the bricks and sheets, which are all disposed. Per next supply us with more, as also some green welch plaines, noe other colours. The gun carriages and things belonging to them Mr Bradshaw will give you a full accompt. According to your order have sent you six iron barrs for to worke the severall necessaryes ffollowing, nailes, hooks, and hinges for the windows and doores, with some staples, and what other iron work is wanting for the use of the great guns. I could wish you could supply us with some plank to put under them, it would be a great preservation of the flankers, and saving of lyme and timber. Wee stand much in need also of boards, to make new prison doors, which are all very bad."
1425,2,785,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,26/11/1687,Fort,RAC,"I wrote you last by the Ann Sloop, which departed hence the 21st instant with twelve Negroe slaves, which I thought sufficient. This goes by a fishermans canoe, which I thought fitt to acquaint you thereof, also to informe you that wee want some green Welch plains, halfe barrels and quarter barrels of powder, no other sort, wee having wholes enough, which I can not sell. By the Sloop I wrote you the needfull, so referring you till her arrivall."
1426,2,786,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,03/12/1687,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys my November accompt with the ballance, being 5mk 3o 7a 8ta. I have not elce to write you, having wrote you the needfull before. In my last, informed you of our wanting halfes and quarter barrells of powder, green Welch plaines and sheets, to be sent if possible at first oppertunity. As to other goods, informed you formerly suppose are not as yett arrived with you, soe must waite with patience. By the Ann Sloope, according to your orders, sent you six iron barrs to worke out in the severall necessaryes informed you, not forgetting iron wedges; those sent before are all splitt to peeces, quite out of service.
You informed me that I should pay Sarjeant Peter Baldwer 8a 412<math id=""actrade-9780197262528-math-40"" display=""inline"">

1427,2,787,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,09/12/1687,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 7th instant came safe to hand, being glad to understand that certaine ships are arrived you, hope with goods proper for this place. You have the perticulars before you, to be more sure have underneath mentioned them againe. I shall observe what you write tending in procuring of Negroes, but you know the Blacks will have what they list, elce will goe to other places, however shall doe for the best. I take notice of what you write concerning the French men. Wee are soe unprovided in our forces that Wee are in greate necessity of those materialls I wrote for the greate guns, which you write you cannot furnish us, soe what to say I know not, referr to patience. I returne you many thanks for your kind invitation at Christmas and begg your excuse for this time, having a greate deale to doe to the Fort which I would faine see finisht. When done, shall come and pay my respects. Besides Mr Bloome is not as yett verst in the way of comerceing with the natives at [sic] this place requires, soe that it is impossible for me to stir. I wrote you last concerning the Serjeants pay, as yett noe answere, pray informe per next. Soe wishing you all a merry Christmas with a New Yeare.
Goods in demand at Accra, vizt nicconees broad, pautkaes white, sheets, sayes, blew and green perpetuanoes, horne hafted knives, green Welch plaines, halfes and quarter barrells of powder, broad striped sattins, and red corrall, these goods wee want much."
1428,2,788,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,12/12/1687,Fort,RAC,"According to your orders have sent you up Mr John Bloome, in the five hand canoe. The goods sent per the sloope, Mr James Bayly, have not as yett landed them, being just now arrived. Per him shall acquaint you the needfull, who shall be dispatched as soone as possible with what Negroe slaves wee have, being but few in number, having not bought any this month, now are growne very scarce. As to the French men of warr you mention, are not as yett arrived these parts, understand are all at Amersa. Here is none but a Brandenburg and Captain Wyborns tender. By this time I suppose you have an accompt of him [= Wyborn's tender] by his boate, which he sent up to you from the Divills hill, he having missed Cabo Corsoe.
I must advise you that if you thinke convenient from this place, I can furnish you with oystersells farr better than those you have from Amersa, one but of these will goe as farr as two of others. I have now ready 50 butts, shall provide more as you advise your answere as to this point."
1429,2,789,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,15/12/1687,Fort,RAC,"This accompanyes the Adventure Sloope with twelve Negroes, vizt six men, six weomen slaves. I am sorry I must informe you of a sad accident. Eight lusty men Negro slaves are run away, which I am in hopes to gett againe, understanding w[h]ere they are sheltered, Ahenisha having promised to see them returned. My misfortune hapened in the manner ffollowing. Having greate occasion for lime for the repairing of the Castle, I ordered the Serjeant to send the Bumboys and slaves in long irons to goe and cutt wood for the burning of the same. The Serjeant did, but not with that discretion as he ought to have done, sends ten of the lustiest men in said irons with but two Bomboys. The slaves when they came to the plase assigned them and found their advantage, they seized the said Bumboyes, and wounded one of them in the back, and by chance of 10 Negroes that went out 2 came back againe, one of them being also wounded, which I send you per the bearer. Slaves now are growne very scarse. What comes the country people will have what they list, and without I comply, you cant expect noe slaves. The goods that came per this conveniency I received. The bailes of pautkaes I opened before Mr Bayly, thirty six of them are much damaged, occasioned by the rubbing of the said bailes. The sheets you sent are all disposed, soe wee want more, a greater quantity, as also broad niccanees. I wrote you last concerning oyster shells and Serjeants pay. Noe more at present, only wishing you all a merry Christmas."
1430,2,790,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,17/12/1687,Fort,RAC,"I wrote you the needfull per the Adventure sloope. Then advised you of our want of more sheets. Those you sent last are all disposed, also almost all the blew perpetuanoes, to that desire a further supply, and broad niccanees (if any). Wee are in extreame want of those carriages for the guns I advised per the Ann Sloope and iron worke for the same, also to send us the great gun out of the Adventure Sloope.
This accompanyes Captain Quow, who desired the liberty to come up at the buriall of one of his wives. I begg leave he may stay a weeke or two. Hear [= here] is the Mary. Captain Burdis is gone for Alampo. Captain James is very sick aboard, has not been on shoare by reason of his indisposition. Send us more markt iron barrs. Being in hast."
1431,2,791,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,20/12/1687,Fort,RAC,"I wrote you last by a two hand canoe bound to your parts, then informing you our wanting more sheets, blew perpetuanoes, says and markt iron barrs. This serves to acquaint you of the same, to send us a greate quantity as soone as possible, not forgetting iron wedges and a couple of axes. Slaves are scarse, what comes they will have what they list. Having not elce to enlarge. Just now came to hand yours by Mr Kyte, shall follow what you have directed."
1432,2,792,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,02/01/1688,Fort,RAC,"This returnes the canoe which brought yours of the 26th past, in which you advised of a letter you received from Mr Fensman concerning the French treating with Ahenisah, to obaine Christiansburg Fort into their possesion, the same sent you via De Mina under cover of the Dutch Generall, and not having any from me affords you some jealousie, as well from the Dutch as from the French. I had informed you at that time, but thought it better and safer way to make the thing knowne to Ahenisah, that the said Fort was ours in pawne, and in equity could not dispose of it, to accomplish their [i.e. the French] desire. Waiteing his answere, in the interim arrived yours, which was much to the same purpose, I also imeadiately acquainted him of it. He pretends that he never knew before that wee had any right to it, and since it is soe, that wee desired the Castle into our custody, wee should have it before any other nation, paying the 40 bendyes, as the French had promised, due to him for the Danes, which they dayly refuse to disburse. I told him, as you directed, what was owing from them, they ought to make good, that after wee had possession of it wee would satisfie him punctually, upon which this day he sent his son to the Danes, to tell them that if they would not make immeadiately due payment he would take Christianbsurg Fort, and deliver it the English per fforce. This morning to make an end of the busness, Mr Fensman paid 20 bendyes in gold, and 20 ditto in goods, soe then now the French are put by of their designe. As to the Dutch encroaching into this affaire, I am fully satisfied to the contrary. The letter Mr Fensman wrote them I saw, which is to the same purpose he wrote you. I delivered yours to him. Inclosed is his answere, and what he did was his ignorance.
Wee want more sheets, niccannees broad (if any). I am sorry you have noe blew perpetuanoes. I desire you to send me some paper, quills, or wax."
1433,2,793,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,07/01/1688,Fort,RAC,"Just now came an express from Ahenisah, who notwithstanding having received his due from the Danes is resolved to turn them out of Christiansburg Fort for the dayly abuses they give his people, is soe much incensed against them (for the same) that he will beare it noe longer, and resolved to deliver it to the English, in case wee should refuse then to the French. This came to me just now and withall desired me imeadiately to come up to him, and that he himselfe would give me possession. I could not goe by reason of leaving the Factory, but have sent my guner to dive into it. His [ = Ahenisah's] intention is to come downe to Labardee. He is very angry and furious insomuch that what the Danes gave him, he would not
keep it, but in a collerick manner hath sent it back to them. What to say in this case know not, but crave your answere imeadiately. Now receive yours of the 6th instant per Captain Quow. Have noe time to answeare, neither to send you my December accompts, although ready. Shall send you when I have an answere from my guner. I have sent Ahenisah two peeces of sayes as for an encouragement."
1434,2,794,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,09/01/1688,Fort,RAC,"This accompanies an Arda slave, an old servant to the Company, who hath lost his left hand, occasioned by the fireing of a gun at the salutation of the Castle by a Dutch Company shipp, as I judge bound for Alampo, not spunging the same before he gave it his charge againe, which is a thing I wonder at, a fellow who hath given his attendance to the guner, who is now, as advised you, at Quamboe, with Ahenisah, as yett have noe answere, was forced to make use of the said Arda slave to officiate the same, having noe Whites that understood any thing of that matter, his hand being in such a condition that by good fortune Captain Cowley and his Doctor being here, his Doctor advised it should be cutt of, which he did. Having noe body to ffollow the cure, I thought it more convenient to send him up to you, where some meanes may be used.
My last advised you that Ahenisah would not accept of the Danes payment. Since have advisd him to receive the same, which he hath done, and after to use his pleasure, which I shall advise you shortly. Being in hast."
1435,2,795,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,18/01/1688,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys my December accompt with his ballance, being 13 mk 6 oz 5a 4 ta. It would have been with you sooner, the difference betwixt Ahenisah and the Danes put by my intent, [he] is still soe much incenced against them that he is fully resolved to turne them out of their habitation shortly, the same to be delivered the English, the French to goe reside at Taisha. I have endeavored to hinder their settlement in these leward parts, Ahenisah will heare nothing of it but hath promised me faithfully he will not suffer them to buyld a Fort, only a house, for that reason has ordered them the abovesaid place, where there is noe stones to come at.
You are saying that you beleive Mr Fensman is tampering with the Dutch, whereby to inable him to satisfie us. I am well satisfied to the contrary, and can assure you none will have possession but us. When the thing comes to the point shall advise you. As to any pretence of injury done him I know of none, neither shall there any be offered by us, but what shall be acted to his displeasure is through his means, for the King says for [sic] the severall abuses the Danes have done his people, is the thing insenced [him] against them, and fully resolved to remove them from Christiansburg Fort where they now reside, the same to be delivered in the hands [of the English] as aforesaid, but in case of their refusall then to the French. At that time when I made the thing knowne to Ahenisah, that it was properly ours, the same instant the French were drawing up the Articles of Agreement, which was put by, with a promise that none should have it but us. The same woards Ahenisah sent downe by our guner, who is now returned from him.
In my last I forgott to acquaint you that the shipp Mary was liked to have been consumed by ffire in Accra Roade, it hapned in the manner ffollowing. Captain James, Comander of the said shipp, being ashoare with me, the Cheife Mate aboard tyes a cracker at a monkyes tale [= tail]. The said monkey being frighted with the same, runs up in the maine topp and [w]raps himselfe in the said saile, with the said cracker, setts the maine topsaile afire, burnt all the same part of the yard and said rigging. The sparkles of the ffire that came from the said topp burnt the arning [= awning] on the quarter deck. By Gods mercy it proved calme that day, having no sea brease, elce the said shipp had certainely been lost. News was brought the Captain ashoare, in another maner then it was acted aboard, informing him that the said monkey should take the match, as usually it is on the quarter deck, run up in the topp with the same, sett the saile afire as aforesaid. Doe beleeve Captain James knowes noe better to this day. I was informed of the truth how the thing was acted by the Cheife Mate on board, by the Master of Captain Wybournes vessell privately, who was on board the Mary then and gave his assistance in putting the said fire out.
I am sorry you have none of those goods I wrote for. Wee want the iron worke for the guns, not forgetting a couple of hatche[t]s, to curt wood, a few deale boards, to ffix a five hand canoe and seaven hand ditto, which, being in greate want, I have bought from Mumford. You wrote me about burning of lyme, it is impossible to doe it here, but if you want any oystershells you had best advise in due time, that I may gett them ready against oppertunity shall present. These sort of shells will doe you better service then those you fetch from Amersa. Just now arrived Captain Thompsons canoe from Arda with letters from [= for] you. She hath been 12 days from Whyddah, the people are tired. Tomorrow she shall proceed for your parts. She left Mr Carter there, the Mary, Captain Cowley, and Captain Wybourne. Thompson is dead that lived there."
1436,2,796,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,25/01/1688,Fort,RAC,"This goes by an oppertunity of a canoe bound to Agga, is to informe you that wee [want] some powder, in halfe barrells (if not any, then whole will doe), and a few boysados, and also to desire you to send downe a sloope, or other conveiniency, to discharge me of 30 Negroes, being most men. I am sorry you have noe sheets, says or blew perpetuanoes, those goods are much in demand, as also broad niccanees. You may also send a few iron barrs markt.
I suppose that you have not heard that Ahenisah has routed all Alampo people, on the other side of the River V[u]lter. Wee are in want of the iron workt and materialls for the guns. I must informe you that heare is sundry letters passes between Doctor Woolber, chyrurgeon at Annamaboe, and Mr Nicholas Fensmen, Cheife of the Danes. Those letters sent here under cover of my neigbor (and to me) makes me thinke there is something more then ordinary. Besides am informed (by the bye) that the said Woolber writes all transactions done to windward, more especially [by] his Cheife at Annamaboe, who he makes a laughing stock."
1437,2,797,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,05/02/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours by the Ann Sloope and powder have received. I am sorry you have not the goods wrote for. I perceive you are against selling sheets at 33 per bendy, which was ever allowed, and thinke it a greate unjustice to pay that which I duely pay (an odd sheete for custome), the Dutch the same, and charges of the Factory you also mention is what was ever expended and brought to accompt. The coales you write for I have none, soe must waite with patience for the iron worke. Monsieur Du Cass and Monsieur Chevalier D'Amon are here. I could hartily wish their ridence, am never without their company. Ahenisah[s] sonn Bubbee is on board of them, I suppose with an intention to place them at Tisha. I expect him ashoare every moment to know his proceedings, in my next shall give you a more satisfactory accompt."
1438,2,798,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,14/02/1688,Fort,RAC,"This is by a canoe bound to Morea serves onely to advise you the Ann Sloope departed hence two dayes agoe, with 36 Negroes, vizt 24 men, 12 weomen slaves, being as many as she could conveniently carry. You advised me to buy corne, I have endeavoured, here comes downe noe more that [= than] what supplys the Negroes occasions. This I thought fitt to advise you in time. As to coales I have none. The French ships are both fallen as low as Labardee, having 7 men on shoare there. Although they are at a distance yett I am still dayly perplexed with their company, having much rongued [= wronged] my selfe with overmuch drinking with them, hath caused my old distemper, a violent tenasmus. I have the assistance of there Doctor. The Captain of the small ship with two more is gone to Ahenisah two days agoe, not as yet returned; what proceedings they have made I know not as yett but when I am informed of the certaine truth, shall punctually advise."
1439,2,799,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,19/02/1688,Fort,RAC,"By the bearer you will receive twenty foure men, twelve women amounting in all to 36 Negroes. I will write you more at large, by spedier oppertunityes."
1440,2,800,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,20/02/1688,Fort,RAC,"This accompanies my January accompt with its ballance, being m3 0 12a 6ta. It would have been with you sooner, had not my late indisposition prevented me, which I hope you will excuse. The Ffrench ships are both gon for Ardra, frustrated of their designe, and without setlement. Ahenesah and they could come to noe agreement, demanding of them 500 bendyes for liberty of habitation. Is also still much incensed against the Danes, and they very timerous of him, not daring to stirr out of their Castle, which is continually kept shutt. Captain Waggoner is here, he tells me you were saying you would send letters by him, if so desire you would dispatch them here as soon as possible, [he] designing for Europe 5 days hence at furthest, his resolution being altered of going to windward againe. Here is also arrived Mr Veraus [= Everaus], with Mr Adrians to succeed him, formerly chief of Cormentine. They brought downe a fresh supply of of all sorts of goods. Here is no trade but for sheets, says, blew perpetuanoes, and broad nicconees. I have according to your order used all means to procure corne, here comes no more than what supplyes the Negroes present occasion."
1441,2,801,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,01/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours by the 17 hand canoe of the 25th past came safe to hand, with the goods therein mentioned. Observe its contents, which shall indeavour to follow it in all perticulars. Must desire a further supply of powder, haveing but nine barrells left of them, three being much damaged. The sheets you sent are very few, desire a greater quantity, with broad nicconees. The powder send with all speed, in quarter or halfe barrells if possible. Slaves are very scarce. What comes goes to the Dutch, he haveing the liberty of sattisfieing the negroes in goods they desire. Wee are much necessitated for want of the great gunn which is in the sloop, and the iron worke formerly wrote for, with a few deale boards.
[PS] Pray send us also some boysadoes."
1442,2,802,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,04/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"This accompanyes my Ffebruary accompt with its ballance, being five markes, one ounce, ten angles and eight taccooes. I wrote you in my last for powder, which wee stand much in need of, having but five barrells left, whereof three are unvendable. Send us alsoe more sheets, broad niccannees, a few boysadoes. According to your order am endeavouring to procure what slaves presents, heare is but few that offers. As to corne I cannot procure any. Ahenisah is making all provicons he can to fight the Anguinas. This day sent an express for 12 barrells of powder, 1 had not to supply him. He is dayly watching to paniar Mr Fensman, who lives like a prisoner, not daring to stirr out of out of Christansburgh ffort, which is dayly kept shutt from morning untill night. Pray send us some writing paper and quills, and some cartridge paper, wee stand much in need of.
PS. By reason the weather proves very unlikely, I have stoped the gold from proceeding by this canoe, soe referr untill the oppertunity of a sloope."
1443,2,803,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,15/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 10th instant came safe to hand by Bradshaw, by whom I received the boysadoes and powder. By this conveniency you will receive no slaves, having only by me to supply Captain Buttrams occasions, they are now very scarce. The Olampo people being most part gon from their habitation, by means of Ahenesah, who is now preparing for to warr the Anguinas, nothing at present vends here but ammunition. The powder you send went of at its landing, if you can afford a larger supply it will do well, as also sheets."
1444,2,804,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,20/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours received yesterday. The shipp you mention did not arrive me until this morning. As soon as he saluted the Castle and ankored, he sent his Lieutenant and Scrivand ashore, to know whether Monsieur Du Cas left any letters with me, both which persons I knew in Agent Greenhills time. They are designed for slaves, as you advise, and the shipp of the same force of guns (with 60 men, no more), if possible to windward of Whydah, if not to proceed further. They pretend their not stay[ing] to windward was thinking to have meet Monsieur Du Cas here, for whom they have certaine letters and orders, which they will dispatch downe by a canoe, if they find incouragement here, if not they will be the bearer themselves. They lye at the Deans roade. This is what I learne of them at present and beleive are upon no bad designe. You write I must spare Captain Buttram some corne from this place, then if so I must decease from buying any slaves, having but 60 chests of corne left, and 30 odd slaves in the Castle, and to procure any here it is a thing impossible, Ahenesah will let none come downe, now shortly is going against Anguyna, neither will he suffer any to buy any other goods than ammunition. Of those perpetuanoes you sent, I have not disposed of one. Slaves also are very scarce. I wrote you by the sloope, some days agoe, that I sent no Negroes, having then no more than what you ordered for Captain Buttram. Pray send us some more phota's and powder if possible. The French man has been but 8 weeks from Europe."
1445,2,805,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,29/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours by the Dragon, Captain Francis Buttram, came safe to hand. According to your order have loaden on board him ninteen slaves, vizt twelve men, seaven women, amounting in all with what came from you to forty, as per inclosed bill of loading doth mention, twenty eight men, twelve weomen Negroes. The other two bills shall be sent as advised, and all other perticulars you mentioned officiated according to your directions. This canoe is sent to you expressly to informe you that Ahenisah is willing to comply with your price for powder, and desires if possible to spare him eighty barrells and four chests of snaphanses. Lett them be very good, matching the sample which now I send you, both long and short. I have mony ready for what I write you. Send us also some longees, though here is no trade but for ammunition. The Dutch has a great trade for the same. Ahenisah intends to march out within this twenty days, so would desire you to supply us as soone as possible. The ballancee of February and March accompts shall be forwarded by Mr Price. The powder you sent last Ahenisah complaines was none of the best, desire what you now sent may be good and dispatch it downe speedily."
1446,2,806,William Clifton,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,29/03/1688,Fort,RAC,"Haveing this opertunity I take the liberty to acquaint you of my arrivall and to give my hearty [thanks] for all your favors, which by my dilligence I shall endeavor to requite. Mr Whiting received mee very kindly and I doubt not but that we shall live very quietly, which I will endeavor to my utmost, of which pray be assured."
1447,2,807,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,04/04/1688,Fort,RAC,"I wrote you last, by way of express, for a fresh supply of powder, as yet have no answer. This goes by a small canoe bound to Cormantyne and is to signifie the same, and also to informe you that Mr Thomas Price is lame in his foot and not very well in health. Our canoes here are so leaky that wee have not wherewithall to accompany him up, except wee had deale boards to fix a new seaven hand and five hand. The multiplicity of turnadoes will not permitt him to venture in a small one. All your orders are accomplisht, in all particulars. I have thought fitting to send you by this conveniency one of the inventoryes, with one of my accompts. The next shall proceed, with its ballance, per first good oppertunity. Here is no trade but for ammunition. Slaves are very scarce. What comes goes to the Dutch, they giving a greater rate to supply one of their shipps, now at Alampo, with 200 Negroes. The rest 300 are now ready for her at the Mina, to make up the complement of 500. You need not take care to supply me with corne. I have endeavoured to supply myself from hence at la 6ta per chest, which will save a great deale of charges."
1448,2,808,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,11/04/1688,Fort,RAC,"I wrote you last by way of Cormantyne, since having none from you in answer, have mett with an other conveniency by way of Morea, is to informe you that the goods per the Dolphin Pinke, Captain Barratt Comander, came safe to hand. Also have supplyed him with two slaves, vizt a man and a women, to compleate the number of twenty Negroes as per inclosed bill of lading, one of which [bills] I dispatcht away per the said shipp to the Royall Companys Factors at Nevis, the other two shall proceed per Mr Price, who is detained here for want of a canoe, having none here fitt to accompany him up, unless wee had boards to fix a new seaven hand and a five hand, so that he is in expectation of your supplying him from windward. The charges being the same I wrote you last, you need not take care to supply me with corne, having procured 300 chests from hence at 1 a 6ta, not knowing whether the same oppertunity might present hereafter. I shall decease buying any more, untill your further orders.
Note what you write concerning supplying Captain Lomax with twenty Negroe slaves. I advised you that the Dutch draws all to them, by giving greater prizes, and what goods demanded, to dispatch away their shipp now at Alampo with 200 Negroes. The rest 300 is ready for her at the Mina, to compleate her complement of 500. Trade is very dull by reason of the warrs betwixt Ahenisah and Anguyna, which will begin very suddenly, hope then slaves will prove more plenty."
1449,2,809,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,16/04/1688,Fort,RAC,"I wrote you last the needfull, by way of Morea. This only serves to accompany an Arda canoe which arrived here this morning, also to informe you that Ahenesah marcht out on Saturday last with his army towards Anguyna, and lyes, as wee understand, betwixt Winnebah and this place, there expecting the Accron and the Fanteeners to treat with them for to help him in his designes. By reason of the same, no trade stirring. Neither gold nor slaves, nor any thing of provitions comes downe. Mr Price would have been with you per this canoe, but [my] being so pestered prevented his voyage. Is as yet in expectation of you supplying him with a conveniency from windward. Being in hast."
1450,2,810,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,22/04/1688,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 15th instant, with the deale boards and nailes, came safe to hand. The bearer has been detained something longer, by reason, according to your orders, have made the needfull enquiry about the quantity of corne you mention, which had I knowne your minde sooner, you would have been supplyed by this time. There is great quantityes at Aquamboe, but Ahenesah being gon from from thence to Winnebah with his army, with an intent, as advised you before, so that these people he has left behind him are only old men, women and children, who are afrayd to come downe, for fear of being panyard by the Anguynas. That litle as comes downe I buy, but to give you a certaine time to procure such a number as you advise, it is impossible for me to advise you, although I have a promise, from one of Ahenesah's Cabushiers, whom he left behind to order his affaires at home, (but tis onely his bare word). As I find how many chests are brought in in a week, I shall know how long time it will be before I can answer your expectation, which I shall not miss any oppertunity of acquainting you. I am sick of a feavour. Mr Price will be with you in a day or two."
1451,2,811,Mark Bedford Whiting,"James Fort, Accra",,Cape Coast Castle,23/04/1688,Fort,RAC,"My last to you was yesterday. Then wrote you the needfull, since which my feaver is so augmented that I am very ill and weake. Not knowing what may insue, therefore have thought fitt to stopp Mr Prices voyage for three or four dayes longer."
1452,2,812,John Carter,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,19/09/1785,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys Captain Henry Wood in the George Sloop, who I perceive was not ordered here, but by necessity of the badness of his rudder come to an anchor to have some iron work made for the safe gaurd thereof, but he that was ordered to call here, which was Mr Obery, was so well fitted to serve the Company that either he had nothing or could or would not spare us any thing, soe that if the Company ffactoryes be in never soe much distress, they are not to supply or assist us, by reason of breach of orders. If they had belong to any other nation or place elce I might I beleive a gott something out of them. It hath been a custome in former times and I think alwaies till now, and am sure tis alwaies expedient that when a vessell of the Companys is orderd for the Madearahs for wine, to France for brandy, or to Barbadoes for rum, that soon affter the arrivall of such liquors all the ffactoryes use'd to be supplyd with a stock according to their expence, some a butt some more, at the Companys price. Now that I beleive and am inform'd that your Honour is alwayes in action, and therfore your head taken up with many other of the Companys concernes and troublesome bussiness; but I am almost certaine that their is some other heads about you that should be ease to you, are more taken up with pot, boul [= bowl] or glass concernes than anything of the Companys business, and if they can but swill their gutts, will care for none elce, therefore tis my advice when next His Excellency as they call it knights them againe it may be Sir Tymothy Dolittle, Sir Roger Doe Nothing, Sir Andrew Love Nobody, and soe forth, and with this addition, (but drink). Had they been Orambarrowes [sic: =?], I would have excused it. Here for our necessary expense have been forced to give two slaves an ancor for brandy, and canot have enough [even] so, and I think tis reason that these before mentioned knights should pay for this extravagant charge, it being not the Company fault but theirs, for not mentioning such a expedient to your Honour.
O fine brave councellors, you know that the ffactory was burnt and great part of the Companys goods, and noe ship hath been here since that had a sufficient cargo to leave any remaynes; and that I am at great charge in building, and twill be a ffine creditt for the Company, that I must be fforc'd to borrow goods to supply our wants of the Ffrench ffactory or worse of Captain Wyburne, which I must doe if I canot perswade Mr Obery or Mr Wood to put some of their cargo ashore, which I am affraid they will not, it being a breach of orders, because I am not a Boneen or Bit Negroe &ca., though without orders I adventure to supply the Company ships with any necessaryes or assistance that I can. I remember before I came out of England and since it was the generall discourse of Comanders that they could not be supply'd with any thing from the Companys factors, but from Captain Wyburne, which was true enough, but now it is quite contrary, I want no supply for ships but have allready, but I want some from them. Captain Wilcox and Captain Mingham dyed here, the ffirst the 28th of March, the other the 2d August 1685. Captain Lowder and Captain Rickard had great sickness here, particularly Captain Lowder and lay a long time here from the 22 April to the 26 July, Negroes then being very scarse, by reason of some pallaver up in the cuntrey, but now are very plentifull againe, for the ffirst day I went up to the kings town to mark Negroes for Captain Mingham I mark'd 59 slaves, 51 men and 8 women, but Captain Lowder and Captain Rickards went both well away, but shorte of their complement of Negroes considerably by reason of short cargoes.
By reason of the death of John Mingham here is bad news that the doctor with Gabrill Cloise, Captain Woods mate, is run away with the ship and 170 Negroes of the Company without signing bills of loading. The doctor, who commands, saith they designe to be honest, and deliver the Companys Negroes at the Companys ffactors at Jamaico, but whether they will or not I canot say, but I fear they are and will be rouges, if they can conveniently. Affter the death of the commander I advised them to goe up to Cabo Corso, as you may se by this inclosed paper, which I sent to them by Mr Wortley, who read it aboard and [they] seemed to be all well sattisfied. In order thereunto [I] put Negroes on board and was making all the dispatch I could my selfe, when Mr Obrey came down and ashore, for 2 or 3 days could not gett a canoe of, in which time they had seduced Charles Langly and got him aboard and confind him, and then with resolution the ships company declared they would keep him and proceed on their voyage to the West India according to charter party, but affter some time Charles Langly got away from them on board the Jacob Pink againe, where he continues. Then the doctor declared himselfe able, and said he could carry the ship himselfe to Jamaica, and desired his bills of loading to sign, which I writ and sent aboard, but before he had signed them Captain Wood came to an anchor and came ashore to gett his iron work done for his rudder, and the same affternone being the 15th September his mate Gabriell Cloyse went aboard and 10 the clock that night they weighed and went away without signing. Captain Wood ordered if they offered to sayle to ffire at them, and accordingly that they did 2 guns with shott, and Doctor Thomas Byre, who bares the command of the Jonas, fired 1 gun with shott at them againe and went away.
The winner hath liberty to laugh, the loosser to speak, the agreived to complayn, therefore I hope you will not be angrey at my just complaint, since I am much agreived.
[PS] The Company surely thinks I have a great stock by me, or elce they would not mention in their charter partyes as if their ffactors here might have 3 or 400 Negroes ready to put on board every ship, it being worded after this manner, that if our factors at Ardra shall have your complement of negroes reddy to put on board, then you shall deliver him your cargoe ashore, and it can not be possible, that I can purchase soe many slaves, without goods, and you will perceive by the inclosed account that I had not much left last June, and unless your Honour contrive some conveniency I canot possible gett a letter carried up more than once a year. Therefore I ought to have a sufficient supply of all things, by [= but] all ships that comes here are so pillaged at Cabo Corso that they bring nothing with them. Captain Lowder complayned of the coast [= cost] for selling his brandy at 1 a per gallon, but here would not spare any for 2a per gallon nor 4a per [gallon], and Captain Rickard would have bought brandy here if it were to be sold. I am very angrey with the severall swill gutts that your Honour hath about you that have drunk up all the ships stock and stores. For above twelve months time, noe ship hath brought brandy, sugar, wine and all complayn it went away at Cabo Corso. If you please to send Captain Wood down here with sutiable goods, whose ship will be able to carry up slaves and cloth and turne up along shore in 3 weeks time in all probability, especially between this and the month March, being the best time of the year, and I beleive her voyage may turne to as good account as where she can be sent. I had not given any consent to come to Ardra but the Company promised me a packet vessell to be constantly sent between Cabo Corso and this place, and although she be not fitt for it by reason of the defects of Captain Bendalls judgement, that is noe sure arguement that I shall have none, but ley here to starve or be fforced to shift for myselfe.
If I could have a vessell down here, and goods and advice beforehand, I could have slaves and cloths ready to put on board without staying her longer than takeing them in."
1453,2,813,John Carter,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,28/12/1785,Fort,RAC,"I have received many letters from you, all tending to the same purpose, of assistance to be given to every person, which I assuredly doe, by reason tis my duty to assist all persons in the Companyes servis. I wish others would doe the like, then I might have had some assistance from Cabo Corso Castle many times before this. Your judgements must be very weak, if you cannot disserne that every ships Ardra cargoe is to short to purchase his slaves and therefore can leave noe remaynes, or elce you must imagine I am like the camelion to live by the air. How can you imagine that since the ffire and charges of building, and the length of time, but I must want a supply, that you write in all your late letters, that I should send word if I want any thing, when Mr Winder knows (if his greatness hath not lifted him above his reason) that we cannot send up by canoes but once a year, and for that reason I did not come out of England with my ffingers in my mouth, but the smack sent with me for an advice boate, to doe nothing but pass from Cabo Corso to Whiddah and from Whiddah to Cabo Corso, but with thanks to the Gentelmen at

Cabo Corso, niether she nor any other small vessell, notwithstanding there was enough at Cabo Corso that somtimes were not better imploy'd, and might have been spared to have been sent directly down here, yet now it is almost two years since the smack came down last. Indeed some of your small vessells have called here as they were goeing to the Boneen, or other places to leward, but with such convenent orders that if we were burning, starving, dying noe assistance to be had of them, unless I would have gone to the Boneen and be a Boneen negroe, which I offered to be here, and have paid them as well. Tis a wonder to me that this ffactory being of so principall concernment to the Company, shiping of twice as many negroes as all the Coast besides, and that a small vessell hath not been sent down to see in what condition. Tis well known that the Company ordered one for that purpose. I am much beholding to you as well as the Company for consignment however. I will not be wanting on my part to serve my masters. The less freindship I find, the less I am in debt."
1454,2,814,John Carter,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,01/03/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yours by the 4 hand canoe were all received and they were speedy in their passage, but they would not returne in [so] small a canoe but stay'd for mine and Quashee, that Captain Low hired at Annamaboe, which now goes in company together. I likewise received all yours, I suppose, by severall ships; but could not answer them reddily by reason the ships did not return to Cabo Corso, for their has been no opertunity that I could here of or procure butt I have writ up since the 10th of March last twelve months past, though I have endeavour'd and profferd good encouragement, yet could I not perswade any canoemen to goe up, haveing been well supply'd and furnish'd with necessaryes, [and a] canoe for that purpose, and within two months I hired 30 canoemen, that our own ships brought down, to goe up, and on a suddain for noe reason that I know the most of them ran away, and disperced them selves amongst the Mine canoes. Therefore unless you can here [= hire] and oblige a gang of canoe men to come down and returne imediately, it is allmost impossible to perswade them to goe up at any other time than about the hermitan time, and this I beleive is not unknown to Mr Winder.
Notwithstanding you seem to admire in severall of your letters that you here

not from me, but indeed [I] have the gratist cause of admiration, first that the Company at my request and desire should buy a small vessell and send her out on purpose and purely for an advice boat from Cabo Corso to this place and to pass and repass, as occasion required and time would permitt, for the better settlement and government of this factory, but since the time I came here niether shee nor any other vessell have sent, though I have been inform'd by severall, that somtimes one vessell was designed to be sent down and other times another, [so] that I did still live in hopes. Now there is three reasons for such a vessell to be sent, first because the Company did order it; secondly because the destruction by fire did request it; thirdly because you did not here from us in soe long time. Twas requested a vessell should have been sent to se in what condition we were in, I mean the factory was in, which might very well be thought to be bad enough after such distraction [sic] by fire and no house to put our heads in but an interloper. Before I came out of England I told the Company we could send advice home with more certainty at some times of the year than to Cabo Corso, therefore desired the said vessell and they granted it.
The last letter that Mr Winder wrot to Cabo Corso to Agent Greenhill I saw when I was there, wherein he advised the Agent that 500 iron bars was proper to be sent down in a cargo, and since that time very few ships have brought out any and then but few in a cargo, which must of necessity make them a commodity. Notwithstanding all this Mr Winder hath advised those ships that had any to dispose of them before they came here. The last he so advised was Mr Elwes, who by reason of that advice sold all his bars to windward, and did not bring one here, as if purposely he [= Winder] designed to doe us all the ingury he can, which I admire att. I doe admire that the Affrican Merchant, the Company[s] one [= own] ship comeing to the Company[s] own factory, should be stint'd to a short cargo and with a great quantity of large bouges, soe much behinde merchantable, that it was 10 slave loss to her cargo in slaves, and I admire the said ships cargo was not consign'd to me, the reason for it would be as wellcome to me as a mark of gold. I am shure you must allow my expences here to be greater than any mans on the Coast, and (excepting the Agent) my sallery and security greater than any persons

than on the Coast, as [I] imagaine, but for these and other favours from you Gentlemen at Cabo Corso I thank you for, as sending down liquors for factoryes expences, and a convenient supply of goods, and the great conveniency of the advice boate. The last letter I sent you by the canoe was the 10th of March last, and that and the former gave you an account that I wanted goods, and you have sent me none since but a little in Captain Lowder.
I have no goods of the Companyes, but am forc'd to make use of the estate of deceas'd persons and my own to maintain the factory, therefore canot make up my account till I am supplyd. I hope shall not be distress'd like Deans to pawn the factory, therefore I request you will be please to order down by a speedy conveyance, and [sic] a large stock of goods, that I may be furnished to purchase a quantity of Negroes reddy against any ships arrivall; and the goods I desire are, vizt 1000 iron barrs; 20 barrells bougees; 100 long cloths; 100 white bafts; 100 allejars; 100 pintadoes, white ground; 600 pautkeis; 6 pieces of scarlett cloth; 2 pieces redd cloth; 40 red perpetuanoes; currall [= coral], if any; good rangoes, if any; lemmons past, white and purple, as big as pease; large christall; christoll stripd white; sletias, if any. If the George sloope be arrived at Cabo Corso, as I hope she may, I request your Honour will please to order her down, with what goods you please to send downe, and if you can furnish her with 6 or 8 oars for rowing, I will [put] 20 or 30 stout slaves one [= on] board, who will quickly be entstruckt'd to row, which may be a great help to her comeing up. If soe accomplished I would not in the least doubt of getting up in her in 14 or 20 days time, and and I long to se Cabo Corso, therefore hope there will be none soe unkind as to putt a stop, or delay any means, that may tend to soe reasonable happiness. Gentlemen I came out of England in good equipage as to security sallery and great promises from the Company, with a small vessell, called a smack, which was brought and sent out purposely for my use, as Cheife of this factory, well knowing the necessity of such an expedient at this place, now depriv'd of the conveniency of the own [= one] and my expectation being wholly frustrated in the performance of the other, pray doe not mock at my misfortunes, because I am not soe happy as to be at Cabo Corso, where some have had the advantage of rising to greater preferment than they came out for.
You will doe me a great favour if you will give me your sentement what you think the Company designd when they sent out a vessell and call'd her the advice boat or packett vessell for Whiddah. Captain Bridges is now arrivd the 4th March, and in your letter by him you tell me of severall Mine canoes come up, which I beleive to be true, but they doe nott goe of from hence but from Pickaninee Popo,  [so] that I am not acquainted with their departure, but if I were, I should not have write by them by reason I have at the same time been sending up my own canoe, which now is above 3 months past and so long delayd by reason of the roguishness of the canoemen, that I had spoake to and hired, a list of their names and places here send inclosed. I have at all times of the year indeavour'd to gett canoe men and profer'd them any cano they would take, and 7 and 8 cloths a man to goe up, but could not prevaile till now [with] those canoemen that comes up, and all the reason I can gather is that the Comanders are put to hire canoemen themselves, and by that means the canomen think themselves noe waies relayted to the Company; but when the Commanders discharges them think themselves abused by me, I suppose, because they have not the canoe given them, though at the same time I offer them a canoe if they will goe, but they will be sole masters thereof, for the canomen generall[y] importune the Comander to give them thee canoe when the ship is slaved, which the Commanders for the most part grant upon their good behaviour, which is but seldom. Now by reasons they gett not the canoe I suppose they impute it to my fault, of all which I pray informe your selfe of Mr Wortley and Unguah, who comes up by this canoe.
It may be you may think I am passionate, but I am sattisfied I have just reason to complaine, but to conclude I hope you will by first conveyance be pleas'd to answer my request as far as the Castle affords, and if the George sloop doe not arrive time enough, then by some other convenient vessell, that she may returne up with account of what state we are in.
I am in great want of white men, haveing only my selfe, Mr Wortley and Mr Smith, and here should be 6 at least. If you please to send any down lett them be good men that will not dey [= die] with laziness. I here Samuell Chambers was comeing, I think he may doe well for own [= one]; since the writeing I have an ill carrecter of Samuell Chambers. What I cant think of to write Mr Wortley will give your Honour to understand. What goods will be sent down, if any is not packt up I desire they may be put up in sheet chests, and will pay the warehouse keeper for them if they are at the accustomed price, which was halfe an angle per chest, then if their be 40 or 50 chests I shall gladly pay for them.
Captain Woodfine is above halfe slaved and doubt not but he will be compleated in less than ten dayes more. The Orange Tree is arriv'd and I hope will be dispatcht in a month or 5 weeks time at farthest, but he also hath a shorte cargo. I should be glad to se Mr Winders computement of the cargo of these two ships that are the Company[s] own, for I can not understand how he makes it outt.
I want to se Cabo Corso my selfe to discourse fully of mine own business,

which I hope shall accomplish some small time. In the intrim refer you to Mr Wortley and to your own serious consideration of what I have write.
PS. Since now you may perceive I cannot send up but once a year, if you have not the conveniency of sending down a small vessell please to order down canomen with positive comands to return, that you may have a better account of affaires here.
Captain Thomas Browse and Captain Henry Ounsteed dyed here."
1455,2,815,John Carter,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,03/05/1686,Fort,RAC,"Herewith send you bills of loading from the severall ships departed from hence since you received any. Likewise the unwellcome news of the death of my honours namesake, late Commander of the Mary, who dyed the 12th Aprill affter about 7 dayes sickness on board, and was brought ashore and buryed the 16th, and the 17th at night the Mary and the Orange Tree sayld. Here goes up now three great canoes, all the Companyes except the canoe that Captain Carter brought down, which he gave to his canoemen. The graplin and graplin roap are all mine, which I requ[e]st may be sent down again, and begg your Honours will be pleased to order the smith to put three flukes more to one of them which hath but 2 now. By a Dutch ship that passed by here, I here that Captain Thomas Woodfine and Captain Buttler is arriv'd at Cabo Corso. I hope they will not come down both together. The Ffrench hath brought a great quantity of iron barrs, therefore advise the ship not to bring to many, but if the quantity before mentioned for the factory I shall have the longer time to put them of, and they will not damnifie. I beleive here is 7 years store of musquetts, therefore if these ships have any or powder to change it or sell it to windward. I hear Mr Winder is gon home, I doubt not but things will be better regulated now as to this place. I think he hath done much hurte for this place by his advise."
1456,2,816,John Carter,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,08/05/1686,Fort,RAC,"Since my laste to you by the 3 canoes that went away I have seen the disposall of all the [iron] bars the French had, which in the last ship were but 800 and in the other 1600, and all are gon and find [they] still are good, therefore to contradict my last advise think it convenient that Captain Woodfine or the ship that shall come down here bring a reasonable quantity of iron barrs with them, besides what you please to order me, but no guns nor powder for a great while. Slaves are plentiful, therefore advise the ships to hasten down. I question not if Captain Woodfine were here he would be slaved in 10 or 12 dayes time if weather would permit to bring his goods ashore, which is all, being in hast, the cano men staying."
1457,2,817,John Carter,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,07/06/1686,Fort,RAC,"It is now three weeks past since a Dut[c]h ship came by here and told us that Captain Thomas Woodfine was at Annamaboe to take in corne, and that in 3 or 4 dayes would be down, since which we have expected him every day, and indeed will be very wellcome, for here is a great many slaves in the cuntrey reddy for him, that could his good[s] be gott a shore he might have his slaves in 10 days at ffarthest. Since my last to you, I have had a violent fitt of sickness, but thank God I am pretty well recoverd. I wonder I here no news from Mr Wortley, whether he be liveing or dead, or whether he arrivd at Cabo Corso or not, tis now three months past since he went. Since the departure of our last ship[s] the Mary and Orange Tree, here hath fallen abundance of raine [so] that the river hath risen 4 or 5 foot heither [ = higher] than ever I saw them and float'd [= flooded] the dry ground about a mile in breadth, and as yet are not quite down, but we can use canoes to carry goods over the river, if Captain Wood[fine] comes that shall be noe great hindrance to his dispatch. Iron barrs proves better than I thought they would, considering the quantity hath been brought [by] the French 2 ships, 2400, and Captain Woodfine and Captain Bridges, 870, and yet they goe currant at 15 for a slave. If Captain Woodfine should happy to come down without any, he shall not want my assistance if I have any sent down, which I suppose I shall. This comes per the Mine cano that came down with Mounsieur Lefrea. I have given them some brandy to be carefull of the delivery of this letter. I hope you injoy your health better there than I doe here."
1458,2,818,John Carter,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,11/11/1686,Fort,RAC,"Just now the Dutch sloope comes up into the road bound up to the Mina. I supose I have just tyme to satisfie you that if the Affrican Pink, Captain Nanter, comes downe here without bouges itt will bee troublesome to procure her slaves, butt it shall bee done to the best of my endeavour. If you please to send her, the goods most proper withoutt bouges are as followeth: rangoes, good red, as many as you canne; currell, aboutt 400 lb; brasse neptunes, large; long cloth; sallempores; large white baftes, a great many, 100 slaves; broad white ground pintadoes, 200 peeces;
pottkeys, 800 or 900 peeces; paper sletias, a few; striped Hollands, if any; yellow and white beads, if larger then a pea, the bigger the better. If these goods bee wanting, or if nott, twill be convenient to putt some good goods that will sell well for gold, and the gold will bee as good as bouges and purchase slaves att a more reasonable rate, and all men too, both with the whites and blacks, and this Ile make good halfe her quantite of slaves and more in good men, may bee had at 6 pease per head. The canoe now will follow very speedelye, which I could nott perswade to goe before. Bad newes flyes a pace, therefore suppose you have heard of Captain Thomas Woodfines death beefore the ship departed hence. Captaine Branfeild sailed 14 dayes past, this day is gone Captain Poston and Captain Daile, all well. All my people dead butt Mr Wortley and my selfe. In hast."
1459,2,819,John Carter,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,22/11/1686,Fort,RAC,"I wrote you very lately by the Dutch sloope, which was out of sight of land before my cano could gett on board him, [so] that I had noe time to coppie the letter, but think the substance was the same I shall now confirme, being in answer to your last concerning the accommodating the Affrican Pinck with men slaves without bougees, which may be easily be accomplished in the same manner I before mentioned. Affter the major part of his Arda cargo is proposed in suitable goods, haveing not bouges, put a convenient quantity of sallable goods that will purchase gold as she is corning and comeing down, and the produce of those goods will accomplish good men slaves, haveing already discoursed the point here with the king and the whiteman, and the gold will be brought ashore with much less charge and loss then bouges by 4 or 5 slaves in the quantity of booges such a ship requires. If the Pinck should not come down this advise will be good for any other ship that comes from England, if they come with short quantityes of bouges as now they doe, they cannot doe amis in disposeing of any goods unless these most proper goods I now shall mention: rangoes, long cloths, bafts, currall, pintadoes broad, pautkeis. Any other goods they may venture to dispose of for gold, and the gold will doe better then the goods [omission?] quantity of goods and produce in gold. I have here inclosed sent up my last years account, I could not make it up at the halfe years end as accustomary by reason I had not goods to ballance before that came in Captain Woodfine, and now you may see what was remayning some months past and at Christmas. Unless a supply comes down I shall bee ashamed to make up the halfe years account. Since this account have put
10 slaves aboard Walker
15 slaves aboard Brandfill
and severall other small parcells, besides factorys expence and building. Therefore I intreat your Honour and the Gen[t]lemen of the Councill will consider and send down a sufficient supply, for every ship comes short cargoed, and rake [?= take] what they can from me. I have some times 12, 14 or 20 white men a shore, all maintained at the factory and out of my store. Pray amoungst goods for me send more scarlett and red perpetuanoes, but they are not proper in a ships cargo by reason the king is unreasendable [= unreasonable] in the demands of such goods, and tis not the king nor Cabusheers that buy them.
I have been so extreamly abussed by the Company that I am almost ashamed to think how I have written to you but much more to them, though I have just grounds to complayn by reason my reputation is abused and myself slighted and every thing quite contrary to what was promised me in England. I gave 1000 security, and am allowed also double sallery, and that I shall not be trusted with halfe soe much value as my security amounts to is verry hard, besides halfe a thousand inconveniences and tenn times the hazard of my life as any where on the Coast. Wittnese loss of a great many goods, Commanders and all our people, and although it hath pleased Almighty God to spare my life yett I have very often a privatt whisper in my ears that I am threatened to be destroyd, one time by poyson and another time otherwise, which makes me look about me and call all my witts together and almighty God to protect me. One time I travell with a g[u]ard and well armed and another time with an antidote in my pockett, and alwaies discourse the point to the king and Cabushers, but they deny any such intention and seem to be verry true and loveing, God knows their hearts. I doubt not but by the providentiall hand of God to whether all.
I thank God am pretty well in health at present, and now to oblige the king and Capusheers am building a small house at the kings town.
I shall [= send] here inclosed a list of the dead and living. A proper Arda cargo is bougees; currall; rangoes; long cloths and sallempores; bafts; white pintados; allejars; pautkeis; brass neptunes; iron barrs; paper sletias, if good; any fine white luinen; beads, purple, white, lemon culler, green, all round and as bigg almost as a horse beane.
[PS] Here inclosed also send the severall bills for the shipp[s] have been here since my last.
There is the value of a bendy of gold I payed to Say and Ned, two of Captain Thomass Woodfines canomen, which I intreat you will to pay into your own hands for me.
Here was an accident happened on a Cormanteen man named Quacco, an antiant inhabitant here, who was murthered by a Mind [= Mine] man named Andaoma, who stabd the said Quacco severall times with a knife [so] that he dyed two or 3 howers affter. The said mallafactor made his escape up to Poppo but was seiz'd there and brought down here. He confesed the ffact and said that another Mind man named Wooradoe sent him to Quacco to receive a debt, being the value of a slave, and the said Wooradoo bid said Andaoma kill Quacco if he did not pay him, which he did, and was by the king and all the white men and all other the blacks here ajudg'd worthy of death. Accordingly his head was cut off in presence of Captain Poston, Mr Soomes, myself and severall others, also the Cabushers of the cuntrey. This attestation the freinds of Quacco desires me to write, by reason Quaccos brother now lives with the Generall of the Mind, as they tell me. Also Griffin is related to him also.
[PPS] I could not possible perswade the canomen to come up soon after the departure of the Sarah Bondaventure, nither indeed was it then weather. You may be assured what ever the canomen say or pretend, I never did soe nor will hinder their goeing but alwaies contrary posted them away with what speede I can, for I could send every month if possible, if it were a marke of gold a year out of my own pockett for the conveniency.
[PPPS, in margin] Pray order all ships that comes down not to trade at any of the places between the River Volto and this place, for it doth but encourage a parcell of runaway rouges that harbour there at Kitto. They destroyed Captain Payne and 7 of his people and endeavourd the boat also, and at Popo they joined with the slaves on board the Charlton sloope and rum [= run] here ashore, killd the Commander and all they could and took all the gold and slaves.
I hear you have a great many doctors on this coast and that doctor Walber is there. I should be highly obliged if your Honour would be pleased to spare him to come down here, with a man or two with him."
1460,2,820,John Carter,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,06/12/1686,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday the boy returnd from Popo which carryed my letter of the 22d of November, and he tells me the cannoes are not gone, at which I am much troubled, for they might have been at Cabo Corso 6 or 8 dayes agone had they went of from hence, but I could nott perswade them, but they promised me not to stay above 2 or 3 daies at farthest; and all there pretences is victualling cheap, there corne being more plenty there then here; but I am certain they spend more in lying there, then there whole provitions for there voyage would come to here. I pray you will be pleased to castise them, and for the future order them otherwise.
I have now no canoes left, being all sent up and broke to peices, therefore advise that noe commander come unfurnished.
I want a dozen good servisable musquetts and a cupple of good blunderbusses for the use of the ffactory for defence if occasion.
If our canoes are gon of from Papo before this getts up there it will goe by a Mine cano."
1461,2,821,John Carter,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,20/12/1686,Fort,RAC,"This goes with the George Sloop, Richard Hobs comander, by whom I have sent 10 brave young Negroes men slaves on account of the Royall Affrican Company of England and according to your order. But for cloaths I have none, neither have I any goods to purchase any. I did send a letter and account &ca almost a month past by two canoes, who went up the river to Popo to goe off there, and they promised me not to stay above 2 or 3 days before they would put to sea. But now I hear they stayed above 3 weeks, and that by reason of 2 Mine canoomen that came with them. I request you will order itt that noe Mine canooman may be suffered to come with ours, ffor they rule all ours, and I fancie are sent on purpose to play the rogue with us. They soe abused the Braffo that came down in Captain Dailes that he was fforced to enter himself and goe home with the shipp for quitenesse sake. They cut him in 2 or 3 places at 2 severall times ffor being vigilant to serve his master better than they, and all the rest of the canoomen sided with the Mine canooman, and I have always observed itt that 1 or 2 Mine canoomen shall rule all ours, which I wonder att, and I pray beleive that I always send as speedily as I can and never retarded a canoe since I have been here, but on the contrary proffer great encouragement and assistance if they would returne speedily. Ffor the future please to order them to goe directly of from this place, and beleive what I write is the reall truth, and much more to the same purpose and worse, but shall desist, only they are rogues. I wrote you in my last (that went by the 2 canoos, the 11 hand and the 7 hand) wherein I requested some more goods down, which I hope will come by next conveyance. I have since my last account put on board




Captain Nehemiah Walker
10 slaves


Captain Andrew Branfill
15 slaves


and now in the George Sloop
10 slaves



________



35 slaves




These, with the expenses of the Factory being halfe a year more at Christmas, will I thinke signify a great want of another supply of goods, which leave to your consideration."
1462,2,822,John Carter,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,06/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"There hath been no opportunity that I could find or make since I came here, but I have wrote to Cabo Corso, and I have always by gifts and promises and threats endeavoured to perswade or force the canoomen to returne speedily, and of late in particular Say and them that came in Captain Thomas Woodfine, but by no means would they goe till the hermitan. Now whatever excuse they or any other make or say to the contrary are lyes, and I desire you to believe the certain truth. When Say with the rest of the canoomen that went last up departed from hence, I made them promise and swear that they would not stay above 2 or 3 days at Popo, but notwithstanding they stayed above 3 weekes, and all the reason I could hear was because one Mind canooman that was amongst them would not goe any sooner and then when he did goe it was to serve the Dutch, for the Dutch Chiefe at Offrah paniard a man that stole their flagg and sent him up to Popo to goe for the Mine, and the whitemen finding no Minde canoe there forced our canoomen to take him in and carry him to their Generall, which they readily obeyed without order or knowledge from me, and I believe the fear of displeasing the Generall of the Mine made them post away with the Negroe, so soon as they tooke him in. They said they had no room for any Negroes here by reason they had 4 shipp canoomen to goe up in their two canoes. All which I leave to your examination why the Cabo Corso canoomen should stand in fear of the Dutch and be always governed by the Mine canoomen. If there be but one Mine canooman amongst 11 or 15 I have always observed that he shall govern the rest.
Captain Nanter arrived here the 26 December and hath 230 slaves on board from hence, and all the rest are in the Factory with 40 more if occasion served. His cargoe falls short and the more short by reason 6 barrels of his booges proved bigg, whereby was 6 slaves and more lost I thinke. To help him a little what slaves he has are very good and about 4 men to one woman, which will be welcome at Barbados. God send him well there and his Negroes in as good plight as they goe aboard, and I am sure they are worth 21 sterling per head round, I am so confident in the goodnesse. In my letters by canoes and by the George Sloope have requested some goods down, ffor I shall be ashamed to make up this last halfe years account. Per the canoes did send up a 12 months account, since which is now halfe a years expence charge and 40 slaves, and now more put on board the shipp here, and I suppose it will sound best in England that this Factory, where more slaves is shipt of then ffrom any one place in the world, should be maintained by the Royall Company, it being theirs; ffor now am sure I have but a bare ffactory, and I thinke it great pity it should be so empty, for I believe tis the largest factory of accommodation both for the Companys servants and slaves on the Coast of Guyney, I mean of a house, and withal more convenient and secure. I can entertaine 5 or 6 ships cargoes, 6 or 800 slaves &ca, and secure all from thieves and fire in all probability, and the Factory is at the same expence as if all the shipps were consigned to the Factory. You write to know how Captain Walker went away, and I answer very well from hence, and I put two slaves aboard him for the Companys account. I hope he may be well arrived in Jamaica afore this.
Likewise the goods I received safely by Captain Thomas Woodfine, and I request the favour you will not charge me with neglect when tis as impossible for me to doe more than I have done in that particular, I mean oftener sending advise, as tis for me to travell to England by land from this place, unless you can order the canoomen art a better rate or had not cutt the leggs the Company gave me when I came out. My grief is sufficient, there needs no aggravation, and thank God for a good heart. I sent by Captain Hobbs 10 brave young men slaves according to your orders, but no cloths without goods. The goods I desire are booges: I suppose you have none, therefore iron bars; long cloaths; white baffties; pintadoes; allejars; scarlett cloath; broad blew cloath; read perpetuanoes; beads, purple, yellow, white ground, also bigg as rounsefull [= rouncival] pease &ca. This comes by I think a very honest man named Annamah living at Annamaboe, I have promis'd you will be kind to him if he makes haste.
[PS] Just now is going by a great Dutch ship."
1463,2,823,John Carter,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,11/01/1687,Fort,RAC,"I had forgot to write an answer about Sir Benjamin Bathurst till yesterday dispatching Captain Nanter your letter came to hand, therefore send this up to Popo after the canoe that if they be not gone, this may satisfy you. By the Mary had letters of creditt from the Company (it being my request) that what estate should be left in my hands of any deceased partyes (having not a convenient specia here to send home) might charge a bill on the Company for the value and give the Company creditt for the like value. Therefore did by the man of war the Orange Tree and the Mary send Sir Benjamin the accounts with a bill on the Company for payment of the money, which was 23 12s 6d after all debts and legacies paid, which I doubt not will be paid when demanded.
Here inclosed have sent one of Captain Nanters bills of lading for 261 Negroe slaves, all choyce Negroes qualified as in the bills of lading, who now is under sayle this morning almost out of sight, God send him a speedy passage. I have [written] largely already, therefore shall not trouble you with more.
[PS] Yesterday we gave ourselves the honour of drinking yours and your ladyes health, and likewise the Gentlemens of the Councill, with guns, the dispatch being sufficient to bare itt, may itt succeed so well to the end. We want some more shipps down, slaves being plenty, please to order them not to stay by the way, and send canoes and canoomen but more particularly canoes, for we had much adoo to patch up canoes to slave the African Pink.
The Dutch hath done a very honorable thing for their countrey. (As I wrote you) our canoes carried up a Negroe of Offrrah that cut their fflagg downe at the sand, which I suppose he intended to steale and carry away, but being sent up to the Generall, I suppose by request of the Chief here, cut off his head, and sent thee great ship that was bound to Angola purposely down here with the head of the offender, and the said shipp came down with his fflagg at maine top, and as we heard him fire many guns, but what else is don I have not heard but suppose they bring it a shore guarded, and what else may seeme to terrify the blacks and keep them in awe and fear to offend againe in such or the like cases, as I hear more of it worth noating shall by the next opportunity informe you of it."
1464,2,824,John Carter,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,16/03/1687,Fort,RAC,"My last was by a canoman of Annamabo named Annomah, who promised to depart from Popo in 2 or 3 dayes at farthest. He seemed to be a mighty honest fellow, but now I here he is not yett gone, and the reason he did not goe [was] the Mind [= Mine] people perswaded him his cano was to little, and therefore stay till they went. I have [sent] up for the letter by reason one of Captain Nanters bills of loading is [blank]. Sometimes the canomen will not go till such a time, and sometimes they will goe from hence and stay a month or two at Poppo, which is a great vexation to me and have been ever since I came here, and your letters have been like Jobs comforters. I give you this relation that you may not think any negligence in mee.
It was debated in England by the Company whether I, as being then ordered Cheife for this place, should have a dependance from Cabo Corso Castle or not, and twas concluded I should. The reasons given me, that in case of want of any supply I could have spedier recours to Cabo Corso than to England, both by the advice boat was sent with me and the often returning of canoes, which was sattisfactory reason.
But now I perceive I shall have no supplyes, not such as may maintain Factory expence. Where the fault lyeth, I know not I am sure tis not in me. If the Company hath given orders to the contrary, tis but just I should know of it. For all the loss of lives, for all the unnecessessary expence, if any, tis occasiond by the Company, for I did not move the Company to come here, only to spend their mony; but it was otherwise proposed to me, and for that reason the Company required a double security of a private Factor, and allowed me double the sallery, with a promis of advance.
I am at the same expence, as if all the ships were consigned to my selfe, except the brandy for expending in buying of slaves, and that often lyeth parte upon mee too. Gentlemen, by the inclosed account you may perceive what quantity of goods remayn in the Factory, and that I have just cause to complayne; and if you will not please to send me no more I will doe my best endeavour to maintain the honour of the Royall Companys Factory here with what goods I have of my one [= own] and other peoples in my hands till I depart hence, which I hope in God may not be long, my three years being past considerable. I will ask only God almighty's blessing for a fair opertunity and his good providence to protect me safe from this fatall and unfortunate place of Ardra. Now Captain Briston [= Bristow] is arrived but himselfe and Doctor very ill, but hope they may recover. They came ashore ill and went directly up to the Kings Town, and lay one night, but was ill very bad, after that they went both on board againe.
I perceive by the strangness of Commanders two of the lastest when they first came here, that I have some strang[e] ill report spread of me, which hath caused me to make a little inquiery, and I am informed that Say should tell some of the Councill of Cabo Corso goeing up to the Mine or at sometime that Captain Thomas Woodfine and I had a falling out and that he went sick aboard; such a thing might have been and I not to blame, but on the contrary we had no falling out as I remember, and he went very well on board and was so two dayes, if not more, before he sickened, and truely till the day he dyed I did not think him otherwise sick than with vexing at thee miscarridges of the cano kickatevoing almost every day, and drownding severall slaves, for we were told that every morning he stood on the quarter deck with his prospective [= perspective] glass freeting and vexing himselfe that the slaves could not be gott on board, for if it had pleased God the sea would have permitted he had had all his slaves on board and reddy to sayle by the time he first fell sick. I told him at his comeing first ashore that if please God weather permitted he should have his slaves in 10 or 12 dayes at farthest. He was but one or two nights ashore in all and he was so much my freind that he had been 200 if occasion had required. His welfare and health was so esteemed by me that I would have hazard my health and life to have preserved his.
Gentlemen, beleive me to be so much a Christian that I abhor the thoughts of doeing or suffering any injury to be done by to my freind. It is more then I would have done to the worst enimy I have.
If any such words have been utterd I beleive my man Unguah, who is kindred to Say, hath been the occasion, by reason I will not have him come down againe, hath wrought this forregery. I doe beleive formerly when our house was green, being now [= new] built, it might be a little unwholsome, but now as it is I am confident tis as wholesome as any house in the cuntrey, and as convenient and as moderate drinking.



Captain Walker went well away

Captain Branfill, the same

Captain Poston the same

Captain Somes the same

Captain Hobs the same

Mr Hereford the same

Captain Nanter the same

Captain Gilbert the same

Captain Hosea the same

Captain Crookshanks the same
Captain Daile I suppose never well. These went all well away, God be praysed, and lay all their time at our house, except Crookshanks lay 2 nights at the Kings towne. I cannot gain say or argue against the providence of almighty God, but thank God my contience is clear from willfull ingury to any man in the world, and as Agent Bradly use to say, if any man wishes or endeavours any injury to any man liveing, may the same misfortune happen to himselfe.
[PS] I am troubled I am continually constrained to write such epistles not tending to business.
Here inclosed comes my last account to Christmas last, and if I have no more goods shall be trobled to write no more accouts, so shall be eased of that troble.
Also comes here 3 bills of loading from Captain Gilbert, Captain Hosea and Captain Crooskshanks.
I have all along furnished the canomen with brandy and tobacco and palm oyle, and most commonly cables and anchors, and never had one returned againe. That graplin you sent by Captain Thomas Woodfine, Mr Attwell wrote me word he sent it by Say and one for themselves to, but they keept both. These canomen now I furnish with brandy, tobacco, palm oyle, wood and some other little necessaryes, as stockfish, beef, pease &ca.
If you send the said Say of [= off] a slave you will doe a Christian act and justice to the deceased Captain Woodfine, for his canoman were all strangers here but Say, and Captain Woodfines whole dependance was on his abillity and care, but after Captain Woodfine went on board he [= Say] never would stirr off in the cano but stand ashore and se the cano kickativoo, and when Mr Attwell, who was there for he went alwaies to the waterside, saw the miscarridges and scolded at Say for not goeing off, Say laughed at him. Then Attwell told me and I threttened him and designed to have fully acquainted Thomas Woodfine and likewise write to you, but he took little notice off itt.
He is so great a rouge that if you doe not send him off, I will if he comes here while I am here.
I have strove much to perswade these cano men to goe off hence and now I se their store of flower all is not above a sheet chest full, which they have cheaper at Popo by about 112<math id=""actrade-9780197262528-math-41"" display=""inline"">

</math> [lbs] bouges or 2 lb at most, and that they should goe and go there a month to save that is strange to me.
It trobles me that you should have so little Christianity as to think me guilty of the least thought of such villaney. I never gott but one ring, that was at one Commanders buriall, I think my namesake, but have lost, I think, by all, especially by Thomas Woodfine. Had he lived it had been 20 short in my way, but I am not so mersenary as to vallue that equall to the life and enjoyment of my freind which was honest Thomas Woodfine, whose death I now lament and all that have dyed at this place. I conclude with this scripture phraise, the Lord doe so and more to one [= me] if I have done or know of any such injury done to any person since I came to Whiddah, neither doe I beleive any such thing have been done unless twere to Doctor Gates, Edward Hill and my selfe when we were at warrs with these people.
[PPS] March the 23d 1686/7. Captain Bristow is dead, but I hope the doctor may recoverr. We that live tis almost in missary, alwaies one distemper or another, that we deserve more pitty than such aspersions as is thrown upon us. Some at Cabo Corso have known me before, and I am sure I was never malletious and I hope
never shall, and now at this instant could I meet with an oppertunity I should be mighty willing and joyfull to serve any of you at Cabo Corso Castle, though you will not send me any goods.
I have I think fully sattisfied you according to the truth of my heart and begg the favour of you that if any such aspertions be spread abroad to put a period to them and doe them justice, and the God of justice reward you is the prayers of your afflicted servant, but I thank God honest as to men in the face of the sunn I can declare and so prosper.
[PPPS] Between these two dates have the canomen stayd to gett flower from Popo. I think twere well if you would please to order them to bring down flower with them.
These canomen can inform you when that Annomah of Annamabo come up, that you may gett the letter from him wherein Captain Nanters bill of loading."
1465,2,825,John Carter,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,10/05/1687,Fort,RAC,"Since my last to you by Occammy I have been at Litle Poppo, and the towne where the canoos used to depart from is called Attome, being a few houses (or rather beehives only larger) standing on the sand by the sea side. There I saw Annomah the canooman, which gave me my letters againe which I have now sent. At this towne of Attome I with Mounsieur Couerden the French Chiefe, who went with me, were received by Mounsieur John Poeselwitt, ffactor for the Branderburgh, who hath dispatcht two of their shipps from thence but will no more I suppose. Mr Poeselwitt in respect to us put up his flagg, intending to make us as welcome as he could, and that day we went to see Offerry Grandy, the king of Accraa, who recides about halfe a myle ffrom thence, and whyle we were there the blacks at the said towne tooke down Mr Poeselwitts fflagg and put up a Dutch fflagg, at which affront to our ffriend we returned immediately from the town and pulled down the Dutch fflagg, intending the Branderburgs fflagg up againe, but soon after another Dutch fflagg was up, noe Dutch men ever reciding there, onely
by now perceive them all Mine people, or at least the rulers. While we were arguing the reason with the Captain of the towne, Dutch fflaggs were put up at severall houses to the number of six. We had no pretence to the place, but immediately tooke our things and departed with our canoes to Offeryes, the king, and I lay their that night. The next day went to Sofferyes or Offery Occammyes, that is about 2 or 3 myles more windward, we generally call him Sofferry Pickaninnee, who is the Generall of the Accraes and lives in much more grandeiur than the king, having allways a good strength of soldiers at his command, and the river comes up to his croom, having 5 times the houses thatt is att the towne of Attome, and lives in the midway betweene the sea and the river, and the sea is about a quarter of a myle. He proffered me, if I would send the canoes to take their departure at his place, he will hall over the canoes to the sea and furnish them with all necessaryes for their voyage and always speed them away. He is a person much afore the king for wisdome, valour &ca, very solid and very honest by all report. I thought him a fitt person to secure, and have now sent a canoe to fetch him down to take a fetish to serve the Royall Company only, and shall give him a Companyes fflagg and a letter to any of the Companyes ships that shall have an occasion to stop there, and they shall apply themselves to him and not to the Mine people. They always abuse the English, twas these Attome people that got all the Charletoon sloops gold, or else we had gott some of that againe. If I can secure this Saffery Pickaninny, he is more than all the people of those parts and can do as he pleases. He shews a respect to the king of Accraa, but the king is nothing without him and they are as brothers. The rest I leave the canoomen to informe. Just after I had wrote this I was told that the Generall of the Mine had sent the said Soffery Pickaninnee a letter about 3 weeks afore, and that the letter was sent by Soffery to the Chief at Offrah, who invited Soffery down to him, the truth of which I have now sent up my boy Cuffee to know, and whether he will be true to our Company. If soe I will ingage him as firm as I can, for we stand in need of him (I now perceive) on the account of our canoomen, ffor if the Dutch gett him, there
is no passage out of the river but by this man and the Attome people; and the pride and insolency of the Dutch is not pleasant, and the Mine blacks take after the Dutch, they have all along stopped our canoes and our canoomen will nott or dare not complaine.
I herewith send 5 bills of lading of the last shipps that went away, all having quick dispatch, some 14 days, 15 and the longest 20 days.
The succeeding Comander of the Lucitania, notwithstanding I furnished him with a canoe to slave him, by reason his canoe was too long and not so ready to goe of here, at his going away sold his canoe to the interloper without speaking the least word to me of selling itt.
When I heard of it I told him twas unkind not to offer me the refusall, since I had lent him a canoe to slave his shipp gratis, so at last he sold her to me, and now the canoomen having no canoo fitting to carry them up I lent them this 9 hand canoe to carry them up, and request your honour will please to order her downe againe by the 1st conveyance, she being mighty convenient for the river here. Quavoo hath promised me to take care of her but I cannot depend on that. Here is few canoomen here and no canoes to depend upon. We have now no goods in the Factory of the Companyes, however I will not be wanting to dis[c]harge my duty to them.
If it be possible that the canooman Say hath spoken words to that high degree of mischiefe, I request so much Christian justice (if heathenism doth not predominate at Cabo Corso Castle above Christianity, for ought I can hear great creditt is given to the single report or whisper of a heathen rascall) I request the said Say may be punished according to his desarts and sent off or down here. The villany is to hard for me to bear, that such report shall be forged and I cannot come to give better satisfaction. How many times have I requested a vessel down here to come up and cannot be granted, and I will not be a boy to come up in a canoe. God bless all people from such hard fate."
1466,2,826,John Carter,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,29/08/1687,Fort,RAC,"This goes by a Dutch small shipp, which is come downe purely for their packett or papers, and soe to retturne, by reason noe canoe can come up at this time, and I beleive twill be more than a month before I shall perswade any of them to goe. By them shall send all bills of loading &ca. The Maynard with the Captain and
Agent, and Captain Thompson and the George Sloope all were here and went well away, but the Agent was gon before the sloop came downe here, but Captain Thompson and the sloope sayled together the 6th of August and the Maynard the
28th July before. Captain Thompson had don noe buisiness before the Maynard came downe by reason of loytring by the way. The Agent was but two days after him and in 8 dayes had his departure. Captain Thompson had gonn sooner but his canoe was broake, and I have none here, therefore pray order all shipps to bring canoes, and please to send my nine hand canoe downe, that I sent [var. lend] the canoemen up in.

The shipp Hannah, Captain Cowley, arrived here in this roade the 13th of January last past and is not yet dispatched, by reason few or noe good slaves to be obtained, after any rate whatsoever, so choose rather to keep her here at my charge than to let her go away to my discredditt with bad and unfitting slaves to proceed a voyage, which if would have undertaken might have been gon ere now, and hope now within a week will happen, and then shall send the charter party. The shipp Mary parted from hence the 4th of this instant with Mr John Carter, who left me possession of an ill contrived and rambling ruinated Factory, without any effects of the Companys elce. I see by yours that the shipp Elizabeth, Edmund Batherne Comander, is arrived on the Coast, which am glad to see. The Brandenburgh shipp called the City of Berlin, Jan Reyne successour of Simon de Leon, was taken at Grand Popoa the 19th of October last, by a Dutch man of warr named the Golden Greyhound, Ffredrick Ffredriekson Comander, and will be a very good prize to him. The shipp the Tempest, a French man of warr, Monsieur Du Cas Comander, is come to take in slaves here, and arrived the 13th currant, and the same day passed by a
small Dutch shipp, bound for the Benin, and the next day, the 14th of this instant, passed by the advice yaght for Ofrah, per whom this comes.

These few lines is to sertifie your Worship affter that we parted from Cabo Corso we met with very strong current. We lay'd 4 dayes at the Cape Trees Punctas, the currant running strong. We broak our small bower, our bouy being sunck, their was noe hopes of getting our anchors, and Mr Pearce and I thought it convenient to stand of the shoare and wee stud so far to the southward as 1d 53m northward, and we fell to windward of Cotterue and we stoped at every place. Here is six sayle of Dutch interlopers, and them that I deal with all I make them goe out of my way. We have lost our carpenter, he deceased the 7th day of December. We had but small trade to windward of Cape Apelonia, but we have taken aboute six markes of gold; but we have scrubed our ship to goe to windward."

We turned up along shoar as high as Dickecove but took no mony, and finding it not possible by reason of the strong current to turne aboute the Cape, we stood to sea, and fell into windward of Cotterue. The first place of trade was Cap[e] Lahoe, where I bought about eleaven hundred weight of elephants teeth; from thence traded down along shoar, at Bassam, Ashenee, and other places, but found gold to be scarse and goods at very low rates. We have been here this six days and have taken in all six markes of gold. There is noe place of trade between this and Cape
Lahoe but are ffirnished with Dutch interlopers, here being noe less than three at present, besides a Ffrench sloope. Within a few dayes we design to sayle againe to windward as high as Bassam, hopeing we shall meet with a better trade at our next comeing down. The principle goods which sell here at present are carpetts, sheets, iron, pewter and knives. I shall lett slip noe opertunity to acquaint your Worship and Councell of our proceedings, and for the Companys intrest, noe endeavour shall be wanting of [Richard Pearse].

As soon as the blacks brought us ashoar, they carried me and three more into the woods, where we remained three dayes before we understood what became of the rest of our men, then had we liberty to goe see them at the twone [= towne], who greviously complain'd of their heard usage, ours being rather worse then theirs for we had nothing but corne and water for our ffood, and the cold earth for our lodging. Thus we continued nine dayes, hopeing to hear from your Worship, but haveing noe news, we were in a manner hopeless, the blacks threatening us every day, if noe ransome come speedily, to send us up into the cuntrey, and that we should neaver se salt water more. Then we desired to know of their demands, who at first askt four mark of gold, but at last came to six bendy's for us eight, whose names are under written; then by much intreaty, I came to this place to se if the Cheife would disburst soe much mony to ransom us, but he sent a bla[c]k to make a palaver with them, who brought it to five bendy's, charges included, and paid the goods to the value thereof yesterday, soe we remayne here ingaged for the same, which we humbly beseech your Worship to send with an order for our comeing to Cabo Corso, for which we shall ever be bound to pray.

[The men were eventually redeemed through the good offices of the Dutch, and taken to Mina, and from there to Cape Coast on 21 Feb. 1686 (nos 980, 9824). The James had meanwhile been taken by its Dutch crew to the Mina, where the WIC recognised it as the property of the RAC, but eventually agreed to purchase it from them rather than to restore it (nos 97880).

The same day departed from thence, haveing the wind favourable for us, we arrived the 22d of May at Cape Appalonia about 4 a clock in the affternoon and their meet with a ship that put out noe coulers. I histed out my cano and send my mate aboard of him to inquire what she was and whether [= whither] she was bound and what ship that was at anchor to windward of them. My mate comeing on board againe and told me that it was the ship as Captain Woodfine meet to windward, and had 10 guns and 40 hands and was bound up the Grain Coast, and as he belong to the Mine, and in the morning he would se what ship that was to windward. Sunday the 23d in the morning we waied and stood in for the shoare for conveniency of the canoes comeing aboard, and about 8 a clock he sayld to windward and about 11 a clock he was up with the other ship, and he waied also and they stood of tell one a clock and then they both boare away upon us. We being afraid of them, by reason my mate told me he was bound for the Grain Coast, I waied and made the best of my way from them, but the biggest hold us way. About 6 a clock at night one fyred two guns, but the other keept company with us tell 9 a clock the same night, then we lost sight of them and at 11 a clock we anchored of Axim and rod all the night ffollowing, and the next day we waied and bore as low as the Brandiburg forte, and their we lay for a trade, and the next day being Tuesday Captain Slade was taken very ill in all his bones and I would a came to Cabo Corso but he would [not?]. I askd the reason and he told me as Mr Whiteing had a great deal of anger in comeing down in Captain Levandelo, therefore he would not goe down, and a Satterday at 12 a clock at night he dyed, and a Sunday the 30th May I bury'd him in the Brandyburg forte. I would a sent a cano down, but here is none to be had. He had received about 5 marks of gold before he dyed and he had taken none since, which I doe judge he gave your Worship an account of by Captain Pickard before he died. I have received almost 7 ounces for the Royall Company, which I shall give your Worship a just and true account of every dayes proceedings and saile of the goods.

[In late June 1686 Wood was apparently at or near Sekondi, since the RAC factor there transmitted a letter to him, but he then started towards Cape Coast Castle (no.39). In the following month, he was back on a further voyage to the west, as follows.]"

I have sent the cano to acquaint your Worship of it. Mr Hereford has sent your Worship a great ffish by Amo. We here Mr Cross is not well, and we hant had any trade as yett."

I have also sent down Robert Dingwell, not being well and had a desire to come to Cabo Corso. Mr Innes has spared me one of his hands, which is a Portugues, so as I am not at all the weaker by him."

We have sent down per Mr Innes two mark, four ounces of gold, and we have received since one mark, five ounces or thereabouts, which we doe intend to putt ashore at Succondee, by reason we dont think it safe to send per Mr Chambers by reason he goes in a two hand cano and puts on shoare at Comenda."

We are endeavering to gett to Dickecove to corn and water, then to make the best of our way to windward in hopes to meet with a better trade there than here.

We have sent your Worship per Captain Brandfeild ten ounces of gold, which we hope your Worship have received. We want no other goods. I desire your Worship would be pleased to send per the cano 30 or 40 ffathom of good rope to make bouy rope, for our cables are very bad and I am affraid we shall loose our anchor. Our boatswain being very sick desired to goe to Cabo Corso, and we have put him on board of Captain Dail.

Mr Henry Wood, master of the George Sloope, came down before our departure, and the said Mr Obrey made him his executor, which the said Wood ought to make good all things are wanting, as your Worship will finde per inclosed. Likewise the said Woods vessell was forced to goe into the said river with us, where we were forced to stay with him 3 or 4 dayes, because his ruther [= rudder] was loose, and we were forced to take him in and out of the said river for fear of ffurther danger should happen to his vessell. This day haveing understood that a Dutch ship being aloft at the Boneen town, and understanding that one of that ships men that was taken per Captain Levandelos ship to be on board the said ship, and that one of our men on board us, then belonging to the said Levandelo, was on board his ship at that time when she was taken, and he fearing that the said Dutch man should do an ingury to him at his arrivall at the Boneen, have discharged him and put him on board Mr Wood, and have received from Mr Wood Richard Jones in his roome."

[Bailey presumably now delivered these slaves to Cape Coast, before embarking on a voyage to westwards. On 23 Dec. 1686 he was at Cape Apollonia (no.923), and then proceeded back eastwards, as follows.]"

I endeavourd and stopt at all places of trade downward. I have not taken above three ounces all the way down besides mony for the rangoes I have sold them. All the blacks are all at warrs from Cape Appilonia to Cape Tres Pointas, inland people, and them by the waterside have not mony to lay out. By the badness of weather and a strong currant we broak our cable and lose our anchor two leaugues to windward of Cape Appilonia. He came in before us a French man of 12 guns and 70 men.
[Later in January, Bailey went back to Cape Coast, calling at Komenda to collect the factory's gold (no.219). In February he was again to the west of Sekondi, but was reported to have failed to get as far as Cape Apollonia (no.71).]"

The people at Apilonia being all routed and two dayes before we came away were returnd againe, they came on board of us but had not any mony. I seing they had no mony, wayed and came down and stoped at all places of trade. No canos came on board of us, all being at warrs. I have not taken two ounces in my voyage. I spoak with two shipps that did inform me they found no trade at Ashenee. I stoped at Taccarado and went to Succondee to se if Mr Bucknell wanted any goods. He haveing no occasion for any, I came down to Commenda where I found a Dutch interloper with French coullers. Not any canoes hath bin on board of us as yett.
[Bailey returned from Komenda to Cape Coast on 8 March 1687 (no.233). Later in the same month he was at Mumford (no.885), and then at Accra, from where he returned to Cape Coast (no.74950).] In April 1687 he was back east, at Anomabu, apparently delivering oystershells (no.516).

I did to Captain Gould, whom I thought to have been at Accraa and to whom I was ordered by you to make my applications, but I was deceived in that likewise and received his letter back again from Mr Price, as likewise another from you wherein you ordered me to advise Mr Whiting what quantity of slaves I have procured, which I did in the formenconed letter, since which time I have procured twelve which makes in all fifty, and thanks be to God all in good health. One of our canoe men I have left ashore at Alampo sick of the small pox and am forced to hire another in his roome, but when shall gett up with you know not, the breeze continuing much out and leeward currants, cannot gett off. I have been 10 dayes from Alampo and have not gott three leagues of ground, and corn, wood and water spends apace. My canoe goes for more corn now, and by chance with much adoe and some cost have gott some water here, else should not have had a drop to drink. My wood is allmost gone, and of that I can gett none. I could have gott more slaves had I had sayes, red and green perpetuanoes, most redd, and good long clothes, for the bale I had from Gould was new packt and likewise turned [?=torn], as all my men can testifye, and so bad that they would not meddle with them till abated upon every piece. In your letter you order me to leave the slaves at Accra and there to take in what goods and corn I shall want, with which you have ordered Mr Whiting to supply me with, and with those goods to receive and purchase gold and slaves, but whither I must go down again or where I must do it you do not order me; I shall as soone as gett up make my applicaon to Mr Whiting, and if he has any furder orders from you to me I shall readily observe them, but if in the mean time you shall think it requisite to order him to send downe his canoes for the slaves then I shall want besides the goods that he has by him, sayes and knives, provided I am to go down. I hope I shall gett up before your answer, I shall strive to do it.

I should have gott more slaves had not the canoemen played the rouge and runn away from mee. I stayed for them three dayes butt had no sight of them, although had verry fair weather to come of. Two of them are now come up heare with a story that the canoe is broake all to peices upon a rocke as came alonge shoare, the other stayes att Alampoe, soe that if you order mee downe againe I shall want a canoe and another canoeman, for he is so great a rouge, tis he that hath caused all this, the very Alampoe people complaines of him. I hope they will send him up, for since I cam[e] here there cam[e] a two hand canoe from thence with two slaves, which I have stopt upon his heade and will keep them till you order the contrary if they doe not retturne him. Its hee that I was forced to hire a man in his rome for a month, pretending hee was sicke of small pox, which att my retturne I found to be nothing, soe I shall expect your orders what I shall doe with him if he comes. I received your letter at Alampoe, and received from Captain Gould two tonn of
watter caske. Likewise he putt on board mee one of the gunns that was for Accra, which he would not stay to putt ashoare there. How I shall gett him out I know not, for my tackling will not hold to doe itt.

If they doe continue buying of powder our cano shall come up very speedyly.
As for corn there is none to be gott here, but if noe trade presents if your Worship thinks convenient, there is corn plenty at Mumford for to supply Mr Whiteing with, but in the intrim I desire your Worships further orders.
I have four men and two women slaves, and two marks and a halfe of gold, which I did not think convenient to send by the great cano without your Worships order.

The occasion was because their was no order for itt in the letter that I received by the cano for itt. I desire your Worships pardon for this misdeamenor, and I shall be more dilligent by such opertunities hereaffter.
All the people hath deserted Barracoe, being afraid of Ahenesah, and some of them are gon to Accra and some of them are here at Mumford, about makeing a pallaver with the Accrong Cabushers to settle at Wineabee. Their pallavers will be a Tewsday. Here is slaves plenty here but I want some good sayes, these I have are worm eaten, therefore I desire your Worship to send a cano for these slaves I have and to send me down a cases [sic] of sayes and some whole and halfe cases of spirrits and the prizes of them. I have seaventeen men and two woemen slaves and two marks, four ounces of gold.
Mr Bayly would have bought some corn here but they ask him three angles per chest, but he wayed and went to Accra. They proffered corn to me for one angle six taccoes per chest but they would have broad tapseiles, but I proferred one angle six taccoes if they would take it in sayes.

I was proffered 4 angles a case for the spirritts but I will hold them a day or two more higher to se if I can get more, but if not I will sell them for four.
I have sent by William Stephens two markes and five ounces of gold, and eighteen men and one woman. I have agreed with the Cabosheirs for corn at one angle six taccoes per chest and they will bring it to the watterside as fast as they can."

One of our canomen is panyard for lying with a Cabushers wife in Fanteen. If nothing of consequence happen within six or seaven dayes I will make the best of my way up to Cabo Corso."

I desire your worship to send downe some sayes, sheets, broad and narrow tapseiles, paper brawles, course sletias, knives, ankors of rum, cases of spirits with all the expedition you possible can, for I loste the taking of four ounces of gold today for want of sheets and knives.

I have sent by Henry Stephens, two markes one ounce five angles of gold, one man two weomen slaves, and tenn chests of corne, and two chests of Bryan Ingalls and two pillowes and one carpitte. For money I saw none he had, for he is indebted to mee for one ankor of rum, four angles in gold, and five angles for parte of provitions I brought from Caboe Corsoe down whith mee.

Wee are in hope of having a trade with them, as Mr Hugh Hilling gives me an account, but the sea at present runs very high [so] that very few canoes comes off, and by bad fortune that evening our own was oversett, and halfe her side staved out, and is at present ashore with the canoe men. Mr Hugh Hilling tells me it was only their fault, but wee are in hopes of mending her againe. This goes by the great canoe which came from Mr Bayly. Wee furnished them with a cask of water, and would have boyled some corn for the slaves, but the canoe men being in hast would not stay. They make here a great inquiry for says, sheets, and rumme, which wee are very ill stored with, but will do our indeavours to the utmost of our powers."

The first place wee touched att was Mumford, where wee continued about seaven or eight days, but there was so little to be don that wee thought it not worth the while staying any longer, for in the first place their mony is very bad, and most of it cra cra, and those goods they had occasion for wee could not supply them with, by reason they are so extreame broken that they would not looke on them, and most places wee have been at since, all their inquire is for says, perpetuanoes, nicconees, sheets, and longees. Indeed wee have a great many of them on board, but the worme have damnified most of them, but some wee made a shift to putt off, and if the rest had been good wee should have disposed of the major part of them. The people that lived formerly at Barracoe are building a new towne, which is called Shree, its about three leagues to the eastward of Barracoe, and they are at present so unsetled that there is very little to be don with them, so [we] are plying to windward as fast as wee can, designe once more to touch at Mumford, and there shall lye till further orders from you, which wee hope will be by the returne of this canoe.

One of them we have been in fight with at Cape Mountsaradoe, and put him to the worst of it, soe much that he ran away from us. His consorte is a Dutch man that he has taken upon the coast, and maned with his own men. They chast us so far of, that the ffirst land we could come in with was Lague. I beleive the pyrates are gone to windward againe, for he finding we could wrong his consort, he would not venture upon us, but in the night we lost him. I expect him down every hower. I wish we had but a consorte, then he would not come near us, for he will not meddle with us by himselfe, and if I had but another ship in company, I would not question but to take his consort or both of them. If he comes down we must be fforst to come into the shoar, as near as we can to the Castle. Maddam Nurse and all your children was very well when I came out of England.

I have been with all the Capuishers in both towns, and they say they have anuff but not at the former prizes.

I make bold to send you by this canoe two cases of says, and desire you to dispose of them either for money or send them to Accraa, or where else you thinke convenient most for the Company interest and owners, for gold or slaves. I hear you have none in the Castle nor ffactoryes, nor the Dutch, so they cannot be any prejudice, and Captain Towers told me he had but one damaged piece left.

I have since my departure from you been very sick for 4 or five days, [so] that at one time I thought to returne to you againe.
Gentlemen, you thinke what you please of my being to windward, and neglecting the Companyes intrest, but I will assure you that I have fulfilled every hour of time, butt with little winds and leeward currants, can gett no ffurther. On the 4th instant at 10 at night, wee saw a ship to sea and made towards her. When wee came neare her wee fired severall gunns at her, she likewise at us. Wee chased her all night of att sea till the next morning breaking day and about six came up with him, whom wee found to be a Brendenburgh, who giveing us no more accompt then Captain Towers, only that the pyrate doth not intend to come downe, heareing wee are here, he expecting another of his consorts. When wee first gave chase to the shipp wee was off of Butterue, and in the morning when wee left him wee was abreast the Mina 7 leagues off, and that day with a fresh sea brees gott up to Taccarado, but now have such stronger leeward currants, and little winds, that makes me feare that I shall not be able with soe heavy a sayler to gett up to Ashine in your days appointed per order. Gentlemen, according to your orders I will fullfill to the utmost of my power, but soe many dayes being expended and wee no
further, doe much doubt to fullfill your desire, unless the pyrate will be soe kind to come downe to us, wee being not able to gett up to him unless better winds and currants help us. Wee have now a very strong currant running to eastward. Wee indeavored last night in a small turnadoe, and likewise this morning, but lost ground, and do not know how long wee may be a gettin about the breakers, this place and Cape Tres Pointus being very troublesome [to] soe great a shipp as ours is unless favored as aforementioned.

I am very sorry that I had not the honor to carry home the Companys gold. Since Captain Du Cas and I parted soe lovingly at Amersa, sending by me downe to their Factor one hogshead of wine, twenty anchors of brandy, and two baggs of bread, which I have since delivered to the person left alive, which was Doctor before the Chiefe dyed. Gentlemen I am sorry your computation of my Arda cargoe will prove soe short by at least 30 Negroes, which will be a loss both to the owners and my selfe. I doe wonder where this mistake can be, for at that allowance that Mr White gave me, wee shall want forty slaves, but I hope I shall purchase our complement into 30. I shall take all the care I can in the purchaseing of of slaves. As for Mr Carter he has not above one hundred Negroes ready. Slaves indeed are pretty plenty, which makes me hope my stay here to be short. I have from Mr Carter all the assistance that he can doe for me, he designing to goe home with us.

Yesterday wee came from Ashinee, and there wee left a French man of 36 peeces of ordinance, which lyes there to settle their Factory.

For my part I desire none of his company, for I still beleive him to be a rouge. Wee are as well provided as I can, and hope shall doe indifferently well with him. I have put no corne on board this day, by reason of him, but doe intend tomorrow to venture if he rides fast, or if you please to spare me some men for the time he lyes here.

The two last days I gott but four one day and two the other, soe if they would give me them for nothing, it not be worth my while to spend my time at that rate, nor have I any other trade, they put me off from day to day. I gott Ayre the chief negroe at Succondee to goe to them, which put me to some small charge, who told them how well you would take it and resent it if they furnished me with corne and give me a quick dispatch, but all to noe purpose, and give them what goods they please amd almost att what rates they please. Wee have lately mett with two very bad turnadoes, lost my boates and cut my cables. My boates I gott againe with some charge, I lost one ancor. I wish I had not come this voyage, I have no chapemen, Black merchants nor Factors that comes to cheapen my goods, I cannot sell them at any rates. I intend to lye here this weeke, that is about seaven days, and If I can have noe encouragement in that time Ile come downe to Cabo Corsoe and deliver my remaynes according to the Companys orders. In the meantime I have sent you my boate with some wooden ware. Discharge her and send her mee back with a line or two if you Please how to govern my self, which will be very exceptable. Suffer my boat not to stay ashoare but send her back with what speed you can, and if you you want them Ile send you more of those goods. I hope you will lett mee have watter out of the tank for my good frind Mr Bradleys sake, who is dead and gonn.
[PS] You will receive by this boate 50 trucks, 25 beads [= beds], 35 quoines, 25 axell trees.

1610,2,970,John Bridges,Between Taccarrado and Sekondi,Guinea Friggatt,Cape Coast Castle,24/03/1688,Transatlantic Voyage,RAC,"These may humbly certifie you that I have sent you downe in my boat all the Royall Companys letters, with your owne, and thirteen passengers. I hope you will be pleased to give me a dispatch for the same with a receipt. Gentlemen I have no other news to give you but that I have been on the Coast between Cape Mount and this place ever since the 23th of February, and have found but miserable trading, for I have taken but very little money, no teeth, and about 5000 weight mallagetta. Gentlemen I desire that by my boat you would be pleased to send me up the prizes of goods of all sorts, that I may be the better governed in what I sell for the future, if any.

Gentlemen, I have at present the Great Fatera in on board, which I presume hath left the day for want of courage, or elce by a bribe. The Yong Fatera hath beaten the Cuferas. Therefore I know not what more to advise you off at present, but that the King hath fought very well all yesterday, and since wee have had no perfect advise. Gentlemen by the first oppertunity pray give me an order from under your hands, in what manner I shall act, and in case that from the Mina there should come a demand for the people, let me have your pleasure, and untill I have an order from you I will not part with the least hair of a mans head, as long as life and shipp shall favour me and those that are with me.
Just now I had a Mine ships boate on board, of 30 or 40 gunns, but demanded nothing of me, but made all sayle he could for the Mina.
Gentlemen I received your letter by Charles Towgood, wherein I expected some order from you, but had none, only about the powder, which if Mr Elwes desired it is at your service. By my boate I have sent the Great Fatera, with five of my owne men. At his arrivall pray send her back with speed, and fill up my boats crew, and as many more of your men as you shall thinke fitt."

I am glad to heare of your good healths but sorry it should be my hard happ to arive to so dull a trade. I begg your advise in the disposall of my cargoe, as likewise if it may not be to your prejudice leve to com lower down for sinc[e] the warr hath
occasioned the withdrawing the Factory from Comenda I hope it may not be prejudiciall to the Companys intrest. I have liberty from the Company to purchase my corne anywhere on the Coast. Pray give me your advise and assistance, for I leave my self wholy to be managed as you in patience shall thinke fitt."
1613,2,973,Edwyn Steed & Stephen Gascoigne,Barbados,,Cape Coast Castle,12/05/1686,West Indies ,RAC,"Your severall letters by sundrey ships comes to our hands, vizt yours of the 4th August by Captain Hobs we received the 28th January; 15 of October per Captain Masters the 23d January; of 19th October per the Goodfellowship, Captain Robson, the second March; of 19th November by Captain Nanter, the 23d Aprill; of primo December, by Captain Gold the 20th March; of the 9 December by Captain Crookshanks, the 30th March. Captain Hobs and Captain Nanter being both very heavy dull sailors, had long and tedious passage, and which was worse, both ships happen'd to be much vissit'd with the small pox, which with the fflux, the usuall distemper of a long voyage, carrid of nigh ninty of the Negroes per
Captain Hobs, and nigh half of those of Captain Nanter. The few that were left in both ships were most of them in low condition, so yeilded but a low price. Those per Captain Hobbs, by you stild good Gold Coast Negroes, we here found not to be so, but of severall nations and languages, as Alampo, the worst of Negroes, Papas and some of unknown parts, and few right Gold Coast Negroes amongst them, which are here presently now discern'd by every planter or inhabitant of this island from any other sort of Negroes. The generallity of people here haveing of late years sufficiently paid for such their knowledge are no longer to be deceiv'd theirin. We also observe you send some old Negroes, gray headed, and some very small chilldren, nither of which will here scarce yeild the freight to be paid for or what their passage amounts to. It were better to lett you know, that the like may be avoyd'd for the future. According to your desire we have here assist'd and furnished Captain Hobs with all nessessarys request'd for his return to you. The ship hath cost a great deal more mony and took up much longer time to reffit than could be immagind, amounts to 343: 10s: 11d sterling as per the inclosed account, which is 9: 4s for eight barrels of beeff which the ships company are to make good to you. Thereby you will se all that hath been furnish'd here and what wages paid the Master and men and accordingly you may accompt for them there. We wish the ships future good servis may repay the great cost on her. By the inclos'd bill of loading and invoyce you will see we have ship'd the rum and sugar desir'd per yours of the 19th December, which we hope will arrive you in safty and to a good markett. All possible care hath been taken in the goodness of the caske, which we hope will prevent leakage and any the least then abouts [sic]. The like care shall be taken in what is to goe on Captain Nanter, who is now fitting and may be ready to take in goods in 15 or twenty day[s]. We have orderd the rum cask to be made less than those now sent on Captain Hobbs, and had you mention'd the size you would have them of they should have been so made. We could gett but two hogsheads of white sugar ready for Captain Hobbs, the other two hogshead are very good Musco[vado] sugar, which we are told will sell well with you. What will send per Captain Nanter shall be all white as you write for."
1614,2,974,Edwyn Steed & Stephen Gascoigne,Barbados,,Cape Coast Castle,01/07/1686,West Indies ,RAC,"The foregoing is a copy of our last sent per Captain Hobbs. This serves cheifly to
accompany the Affrican Marchant, Captain George Nanter Comander, who has spent much time and expended much mony in refitting his ship, the perticulars of all which you will find in his inclosed and account of his disburstments, of the justice of which you will be better able to judge then wee, especially in what relates to the seamens wages, and his expences and disburstments at Princes, of which we know nothing but as he informes us, and therefore could take noe other measures in furnishing him with monys but as he demanded it. We hope the ship will doe the Company considerable servis, and so answer the cost has been expended on her. What allowance the Captain is to have for the victualling his ship here we know not, not being privy to what contract you have made with him about it, and therefore must refer that also to your consideration, and adjustment.
According to your desires we have shipt the sugar and rum you write for on the Company account, as appears per the inclos'd invoyce and bill of loading, all which we hope will come safe and in good condition to you, being excellent good in their kinds and as well put in good caskes as is possible to be done, which we hope will encourage you to write to the Company to order considerable supplyes of rum to be sent you from this place, we being told per them that has had large experience of it, that it sells to the natives as redily and for as much as brandy, which if it doe must be of great proffit to the Company to make use of it rather then brandy, since it cost not much above a third part of what brandy stands them. In all the convenience we shall have by it, is to advance the Company intrest, and to help make returns to them, it being now very difficult to make large and good returns, from hence to England. Yours of the twentieth of Ffebruary per the Orangtree, and of the ffirst of March per the Mary are now with us, those two ships arriveing here the twenty ninth past, haveing had great mortallity among their negroes, each ship haveing lost about one hundred of what they took in. The rest have had the flux and are in very poor and mean condition, the small pox also being very much on board the Mary, which will hinder their sales, and we fear make them come out at very low rates, if we can sell them at all, this island haveing for eighteen months last past paid very dear for pocky Negroes, import'd here by an interloper, in the loss of many thousand slaves, besides abundance of our white people, to the great weakening and impoverish of our island, soe that we are in great streight what we shall doe with the Marys Negroes, and indeed them per the Orangetree are so poor and bad that nobody rares [sic: = dares?] to goe on board to buy any. We therefore earnestly recomend it to you for the future, as one of the greatest services can be done the Company, that you will send us as many good
Gold Coast and Cormanteen Negroes as possible can be gott, those comeing alwaies in good condition, also well accepted here, but we pray you by noe means to send Allampoes, for they are so bad and so well known here that, let them come in what condition they will, they will scarce sell at any price.
Wee observe what you write concerning Mr Bayly and Mr Standleys imbeazleing goods on board the prizes taken per Captain Bridges, and would be glad we could return any thing from them for the Company, but Bayly is dead, and Standly utterly denies that ever it was in his power to imbezle anything, for that he was never imployd but in one ship, that had noe goods on board but a little iron and red wood, which he deliverd at Cabo Corso as he receiv'd it, and dares averr that Agent Nurse nor any of the Councill ever chargd him with any such misdemeanor, and seams to be much surpris'd to meet with this account and carrecter of himselfe here. We have not further to add but referr matters of news to Mr Elwaies, who is an intelligent man and to whome we have given liberty to take on board such reffreshments of wynes and other things as Agent Nurse orderd him to procure for him, and we have also permitted some tokens to be put on board the ship, which some people have sent to their relations on the Coast for refreshment, which are not much, besides what are sent to Mr Carter for houshold stuff, house keeping and refreshment."
1615,2,975,Edwyn Steed,Barbados,,Cape Coast Castle,06/04/1687,West Indies ,RAC,"Your severall letters per Captain Wood, Captain Poston, Captain Butram and Captain Nanter are now come to my hands, which I take this oppertunity to acquaint you off, having no other means of sending to you but returne of the Coast Ffriggatt, Captain Wood, whose Negroes came in pretty good condition, and yielded [a] price suitable, as they will always doe, that come from your parts, that is to say, from the Gold Coast, if they be well sorted, young and come in a healthy condition, as Captain Butrams also did, which were sold here in a litle time, and at a very high price, but Captain Poston and Captain Nanter had not that good luck, for besides the mortality that was among them, they came so full of the small pox that wee could find no custom for them, even at the lowest rate, so that many of Nanters remayne yet unsold, and it has spread that disease exceedingly in the country to the great damage and discouragement of all future sales of sick and pocky Negroes.
Your not giving me any encouragement to returne Captain Nanter to you, and
the Company thinking the last repairing of her was very costly, though the greatest part of the money was for seamens wages, which must have been paid if she had not been sent to you, I shall therefore follow their orders about that shipp, in disposing of her here the best I can, for I find she will cost more money to fitt her for another Guinea voyage than did last time, and though the Coast Friggatt has cost now in repayres about one hundred and fifty pounds, besides other insidents and wages due, amounting to in the whole three hundred, twenty and four pounds, ten shilling and six pence, halfpenny, as per the inclosed accompt appears, yet I hope, God sending her safe to you, her service will pay her charge with good proffitt to the Company. By her I send you invoyce and bill of loading for fifty two puncheons, twelve hogsheads and twenty four tierces of rumm, and though it exceeds what you writt for in quantity, yet considering the freight cost nothing, and that every one that comes thence assures me it is a very proffitable comodity for the Company on all the Coast, and being now very good, and at a moderate price, though growing very deare, I was willing to take this oppertunuty of shewing my diligence and care in the Companyes service, and I hope they and you will account it so in this particular. Captain Wood carried himself very well in this voyage, and I hope at his returne to you, will deserve the continuance of your favour to him, and if you see no objection against him, I conceive if you returne the the shipp with slaves he may be fitly trusted with that charge, if you find any error in his accompts, as to seamens wages or otherwise, you will be better able rectifie it, by your books, than I could here, though I hope there is no error in it, though I have by me the papers you sent me thereto relating.
I have spoke to Captain Nanter about the error that happened in your accompts with him to your damage, upwards of two ounces of gold. He seems to know nothing of it, but he says he will overlooke his accompts and give me further answer therein, but I will certainly make stoppage of so much money for you, whether he owns the truth or not, till the Agent Generall may call here in his way home, or that I have further advise from yourselves. Wee have litle news here, only all country comoditys sell very low in England, and by that means the people here are very backward in paying what they owe the Company. All things are very peaceable in Europe, no warrs being there like to be but between the Emperor and the Turk."
1616,2,976,Nicholas Sweerts,Elmina,,Cape Coast Castle,04/02/1686,Fort,WIC,"I cannot by any means leave giveing you advice that their is a Ffrench pyrott up to windward, mounted with 28 or 30 gunns, and 18 or 20 pattererors.

The Captain of her [i.e the English ship] is made Captain on that vessell which they have taken from us, and the rest of the men [of the English ship], they have left ashoar to windward. Their is two black boyes come here along with her, which belongs to Cabo Corso soe as they say, but I cannot tell you the true relation at present of anything."
1617,2,977,Nicholas Sweerts,Elmina,,Cape Coast Castle,04/02/1686,Fort,WIC,"Yours per Mr Wight and Mr Hassell I have received, and have informed them of all the ships that were taken by this last pyrate, for as much as I know, and that there is a vessell belonging to the Royall Company taken and delivered to our men, which were there aboard of our vessell which they have taken. Ile no more but referr to the report done to the above said gentlemen."
1618,2,978,Nicholas Sweerts,Elmina,,Cape Coast Castle,05/02/1686,Fort,WIC,"This day our Councill being here, we have generally agreed that the English vessell which hath been plundered, belonging to the Royall Company, should be redrest to your Worship, and dispose of it to your Worship[s] one [= own] pleasure, but my design is, if you be minded to part with her, to sell her to me, and lett me know the least price, and shall see to agree with you, if you will not to[o] dear valleye her, and will either give you in exchange on accompt a brave shallop or else pay all in gold, soe as your Worship pleases.

doe not judge her to be worth soe much, for she lacks a great deale before she be ffinished."

Last night amounst the men which came from Axim, which by the reason of the hard usage of the pyrate where put ashore, there was two English men belonging to the James, which per these I am sending to you. I am advised there is seaven more amoungst the Negroes, but they will not release them, without they have a present, and it lyes not in my power to take them per fforce, being they are at the other side of the river, but if you are pleased to give me order what charges you will be at, shall take care to release them, and lett them be sent to you. Amoungst the Dutch men here last night, there is one which had a little mony left, which hath paid the charges of coming heither [which] amounts to 2a12<math id=""actrade-9780197262528-math-46"" display=""inline"">

As soon as they shall be arrived here shall send them down to you. Here which are coming to you 4 seamen are willing to serve the Royall Company, but doe desire you to lett them goe directly for London, being they have nothing at all left them but on their backs, and then a long voyage will be more tedious for them. If you have 6 iron guns to spaire which will carry 3 pound shott, pray lett me know the price, I shall send some body down to look on them."

Whether their is any more their I canot tell, but our ffactor at Axim will inquire, and if their are any more their shall be redeemed as soon as possible.

Thers noe news but that all is at peace in Europe, but in France the persecution of the Protestans, and our vessell hath toucht at severall places to windward but saw noe vessell, niether heard of the pyrot."

So I have this day purpously sent a negroe to the king of Comendo, that he will not by any means give liberty to the French to establish themselves their; if now by fare means he will not, my intention is to liten [= lighten] our ffactory and se what I can doe per force. This John Cabess I have a long time minded to punish him for his rogery but have not yet had any occasion.

Our vessell which arriv'd here out of Europe hath met with a vessell up to windward Cape Palm; suppos'd it to be an English Company vessell but can't certainly tell, being he did not speak to them and was afraid to trust them, being he did not certainly know that she was."

I have done not on the account he is in servis of the Royall Company as you now rite, but can show you to the contrary that he is not in your Company's servis, with your own hand in a letter of the 20th of March [16]86. Yet nevertheless his roggerys done to our Company deserves to be severly punish'd. For the freindship and good correspondence betwixt us, will not be soe hard as otherwise I would have been, yet will not leave such villians unpunish'd.

To which I answer that I ame altogether ignorant of itt, butt the same was doon by my boat, which went away in the middle of the night weel arm'd to board my pinnace and bring her aboard my ship, so that I doe not know that any under your worships command were in the least concerned, and being my pinnace was off great importance to me I doubt not but that I should have repaired the loss one way or another, but now am resolved to take my payment off the slaves.
Yesterday my drummer run away to Cormantin, being indebted two hundred gilders att home and aboard ship, occasioned by that the General off the Mine was pleased to invite him to the Companyes service, as your worship will see by the inclosed coppie off the letter writen by the Generall of the Mine to the foresaid drummer.

The 14/24 I hope to have had some further news from your worship, or from our Comess att Succondee, butt the 15/25 I received advice from Axim that the 10/20 an English Companys ship named the St John under the comand of Captain John Rocet, was come into Axim road, which Rocet said that hee was taken by a Ffrench pyrate of 24 gunns and 100 men about the red cliffes, who tooke away all his goods, gunns, necessarys, as also broake up the ship in severall pleaces, soe that according to what Mynheer Verdyke writes, shee [is] very neer unfitt for goeing to sea. The canomen that brought mee the aforesaid letter say that they know nothing of any English shipp neer Axim butt of a little pyrate, who had taken two of their comrads (that went aboard in a canoe) and carried them away with them.
The same day wee received advice from our Comess at Succondee, whoe confirmes the same that the two Succondee canomen reported upon the 13/23.
In all this doubt tis my oppinion that the same little ship which Mynheer Verdyke said was English Companys ship, is the same little pyrate which took away the negroes from Succondee and Axim, soe much the more, because upon the 25th instant shee went from Succondee, and past by Commenda and this place, almost out of sight in the sea, and likewise yesterday in the evening our people of Cormanteen se a ship passing by at sea, which by appearance is the same shipp.
If in case your worship hath any shipp which is called the St John, whereof the Captains name is John Rocet, then will my supposition be false, and that which is written by our Comess Mynheer Verdyke true, which I humbly desire your worship will be pleased to lett mee know, for my further information. I knew no better but that your worship was informed of every thing thus farr, especially because your worships ship departed yesterday night for Comenda."
1636,2,996,Nicholas Sweerts,Elmina,,Cape Coast Castle,16/03/1688,Fort,WIC,"Wee cannot beleive that the unknown French ship is a pyrate, because on Tuesday and Wednesday last he was at Comenda, and likewise hard by our fly boat, but did not hurt, and which is more wee have advise from Axim that there passed by a French Companyes shipp, (appointed to Whiddah, for slaves) called the Glorious, Captain Barritt, mounted with twenty gunns and forty five men. Wee do beleeive and maintain that this is the same shipp, but that the said Captain Barritt did want sugar &ca. Wee could not neglect to send your Worshipps the inclosed, wherein wee have ordered the Chiefe Merchant Everaurs to do all things requisite for protecting the Royall Company of Englands ships, in case she comes within reach of the gunns at Cormantyn, notwithstanding without that the aforesaid Chief Merchant would have knowne his duty. In case your Worships know any further news, it will be very acceptable to let me hear of it, as also the continuation of your Worships good and acceptable correspondence. I recommend you to God."
1637,2,997,Nikolay Fensman,Christiansborg,,Cape Coast Castle,13/08/1687,Fort,Danish African Company,"Heretofore never haveing the good fortune nor occasion to honor my self by writing to you, I wish you health happiness, and prosperity, and that it please Almighty God to preserve you many years.
Seeing by our Royall Commissionate Danish West India Affrican Company I am now ordred to be second person and likewise Councellor next to the Generall Hans Luke, as alsoe Captain Thomas Towers by the aforesaid high and much esteemed Company is made of the Councell with us, who has orders to take pellicular notice in every thing, and utterly to disowne and slight all former disorders and misunderstanding, to the end all things may be brought in good order, I doubt not but by the first the Ffort Ffredrickburgh will come under his Royall Majestie of Denmarks protection, and wee have it in our possession, whereupon I desired Captain Thomas Towers, when sailed from hence, that he would enquire of you concerning what is past, because our Royall Company and I am in the darke about it, chiefly of the Ffort Christianburgh, in order our present place of residence, there being money layde out upon it by those who proceeded you, which neither the Royall Company of Denmarke nor I have seen any instructions for, but only hearde discourse about it, and on the contrary Generall Hans Luke, which I askt him, who would not acknowledge noe such thing to me.
Now haveing lately received some letters from Captain Thomas Towers, by which I am informed that those who proceeded you had deposited seaven markes of gold a[tt] the request of the Generall Hans Luke upon that Ffort Christiansburg, in orderd the Generall Hans Luke did impart the buisiness and shewed me the obligation, by which it appeares that nott only the ffortt Christiansburgh but all the ammunition in it, and which is more twenty good men and twenty good weomen slaves belonging to our Royall Company or [sic: = are?] impignorate, for six marks, one ounce, nine angles and six taccoees in gold, and that upon such slite conditions, which maks me much admire that he should put in pledge to other nations such ffortresses and slaves belonging to the Royall Majestie of Denmarke, and should know noe better how to maintain kings ffortresses intrusted to him, which if his Majestie was informed of, would be highly displeased, wherefore I wish from my heart upon the Generalls accompt that soe soone as possible his buisiness concerning the ffort Christiansburgh may be accomodated, that noe further differences may happen betwixt the Royall Affrican Company of Denmark and the Generall Hans Luke, which as I have understood by Captain Thomas Towers letters, you are verry well inclined that the buisiness should be accomodated, and that you had delayed for my comeing, which I likewise wish heartily to have the honor to kiss your hands. Seeing my health and buisiness will not allowe it, I intreat you would be pleased to excuse me, and seeing wee expect letters dayly from home, and waite Captain Towers dayly to come here before he goes home, wee will advise togather what is best to be donn, doubting not a friendly accomodation."
1638,2,998,Nikolay Fensman,Christiansborg,,Cape Coast Castle,08/10/1687,Fort,Danish African Company,"I doubt not but that you have received my letter dated the 23d August by address of Mr Mark Bedford Whiting, your chief ffactor at Accraa, but had noe answer. Now I understand by Captain Thomas Towers that latly he hath spoken to you about your pretended right to Christiansburgh for some marks of gold, which your predecessors, at the desire of of the deceased Hans Luke, had layd out on the aforesaid ffortt, which our Royall Company never gave him order to put in pledge their fforts belonging to the Crowne of Denmarke to other nations, far less to deliver the ffort Ffredrickburgh in possession of your predicessors because it was put in pledge, but on the contrary to defend the same to the utmost, and observe the said Royall Companys intrest in all things. Our Royall Company did not know in the least Christiansburgh was impledged, but of the ffort Ffredrickburg, whereof, I hope, our Royall Company will have possession soe soone as possible, which for three years by your predecessor, you and the aforesaid Hans Luke hath been keept very close, and though I have served our Royall Company sixteen or seaventeen months in this method neither your predecessor nor you did acquaint me with it, nor did the Heer Hans Luke give any answer to the Royall Company for his past fault, out of what absolutely pressing neecessity or perswasion he had don such a thing, but to his advantage, death prevented any further. I understand likewise by Captain Thomas Towers that you desire to have the money layd out by your preede[ce]ssor, at the desire of the Hans Luke (he being dead), to be paidd with intrest, allthough I find noe intrest specified in the contract, but according to my commission from our Royall Company to succeed Hans Luke in command, I am ordred to maintaine their Royall ffortresses to the uttermost and to observe their intrest soe far as I can, wherefore I order Captain Thomas Towers, as alsoe chief mate Tyaerd Tyerkers, soe soone as they are at Cabo Corso, to speak once more to you about the money layd out by your prede[ce]ssors on the ffort Christiansburgh, chiefly that you will be pleased to dispense with the payment of the money upon the ffort Christiansburgh till such time as our Royall Company be informed of it, and give me order how to act in the affaire, soe long as it's in our possession, but in case you doe not approve of my request, and that I must be put out by you, and you desire me to pay the money layd out by force, as the Generall Henry Nurse upon the 16th day of July, being come to anchor in Accraa Roade, made mee pay perforce five ounces of gold before he would lett me goe out of Captain Goulds shipp, upon the accompt of Hans Luke, which he had noe reason to have of me but but of the aforesaid Hans Luke, with or without intrest, soe I say I neither can nor will pay the money, but desire some instructions to bear me harmles, and likwise to know the aforesaid sum of money, a month before, upon the which accompt I doe give Captain Thomas Thowers and Tyaerd Tyerkens his chief mate to treat with you about the ffortt Christiansburgh in or soe belonging to his Royall Majestie of Denmarke, and what shall be don by them shall be approved of and acknowledged, and on their assignation to pay the sum agreed on, soe that you by authority order, and full power, duely deliver up all acts, obligations and instructions may be disanuled and made of noe effect, likewise the restitution of 20 good men and 20 good weomen slaves, belonging to our Royall Company of Denmarke, which your prede[ce]ssors had as a pledge in keeping at the ffort Ffredrickburgh."
1639,3,1,Christopher Clarkson,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,15/08/1792,Fort,RAC,"I have already informed that when I cam[e] to Dickies Cove I found that all the people were fled, and that with the slaves and canoemen gott 2 guns ashore, a 3d I planted in the canoe for our better security if we should have been repulsed. After I had gott the flag hoysted I fired 2 guns to keep of [= off] our enimies and encouradge our friends. Understanding by one of Captain Dickies boys who came to me in a small canoe that he was fled to Ockadous, I sent to him a little of brandy and desired to see him, upon which he sent me 2 more of his boyes [blank space in original] Wellcome. The next day he sent his brother and kinsman to give me a fatich [= fetish] to be true to him and not to lett the Adoomes take him away, which I took, binding his kinsman in the same that Captain Dickie and all his people should willingly assist in bringing of ston[e]s and other necissaries for building of the Fort, in which I find them very willing, asking no more then [= than] a dram for their dayes work, which 4 flasks will not performe, our camp consisting of 12 Cabbosheers and about 80 fighting men (our slaves women, children & boyes which know not the use of armes excepted), being all in camp on the hill where our Fort must stand. Yesterday Captain Dickie layed some gold under the foundation stone and killed a fatt sheep, which I could [not?] performe, haveing the ground to [blank] our tents to make the foundation to digg. Workmen and lyme, bricks and deall boards will be [what] most I shall want, hopeing to gett most of the timber neer the [blank], for which I desire Bass Johns assistance, and the sauiers [= sawyers] and smith, the stone being very hard. Provision as yett is very scarce only [i.e. except] corne, of which as yett we have enough. Captain Dickie expects a cloth or something for a dashee. I dispatched the canoe the 13th day to fetch the slaves, pray hast[e] them as much as you can. The Cabbosheers expect all to have cloths of blue Welsh plaines, and I am forcied [= forced] to speak them fairr. This is all at present only my love to you, Mr Edwards and the rest of your men."
1640,3,2,Christopher Clarkson,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,26/09/1792,Fort,RAC,"I have most humbly made bold to give your Worships to understand that on the 22th instant I received a letter from Mr Johnson, Factor at Succondee, as also on the 27th [sic = 24th?], which speciefyed as followeth, vizt that I protected the Adoomes enemies, not nominating any persones but one Neddee, one of the Cheif[s] of this place, which as I understand is for the promotion of the English interest and much respected by Captain Dickie and the rest of the Cabbosheers. [blank] of the said letters, and understanding the Buttre men or Asherves [= Ashreve's] party haveing the day before ingadged the Adoomes, and the said Captain Neddee being privat[e]ly departed hence and at Butteroe, I sent the rest of his familly to him, for which reasone the rest of the Cabbosheers would have gone and resided at Ocada, beleiveing that Captain Dickie and I had dealt unjustly with them, but after were reconcealed [= reconciled] again and Captain Dickie with 9 more of the Chief[s] took a fetich to be true to the English, and noewise to ingadge against the Adooms without [being] molested by them first. I also took the same still to protect them as long as they keept their fetich and all were well satisfied. I should have had the guns mounted upon the flancker by this time were it not for exces[s]ive rains we have had here. I have been verry ill disposed in body, and were it not for one man, a soldier belonging to Mr Johnson at Succondee, who hath used his endeavour much, I might have been in my grave. His name is William Morrell, and [I] most humbly desires your Worships would grant me he may remaine here with me, here being not one upon occasion can drese [= dress] or look after a man, and we are daily not without some small desasters or others. I have sent to Succondee some maulls and crows to be mended at Cabo Corso, but I have not had them since."
1641,3,3,Christopher Clarkson,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,01/10/1792,Fort,RAC,"According to your Worships command I have indeavoured to the utmost of my power in getting the canoes your Worshipps required, but found them not fitting for service, being all old but new burnt and fitted up, and so amongst them all I have found and bought one large 7 hand canoe new and am promised by a Black man that makes them to be fitted with the rest specifyed in your letter in three or 4 dayes. I am much troubled at the unfortunat[e] death of Mr Gregory, and wish your Worships more prosperous dayes then he did."
1642,3,4,Christopher Clarkson,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,10/10/1792,Fort,RAC,"I have most humbly made bold to present to your Worships these to lett your Worships understand I have been at great expence for your service and want many bricks, with lime and deall boards for the covereing of the flancker. The smith I have sent again [i.e. back], being no wayes fitt for service, and desire of your Worshipps to send by the first oppertunity George Walker. So haveing gave your Worshipps a full accompt in my last I conclude.
[PS] I once more make bold to desire of your Worshipps more guns for encouragment of the natives."
1643,3,5,Christopher Clarkson,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,12/10/1792,Fort,RAC,"I have most humbly made bold to give your Worshipps to understand that Capt. Jeffryes is safe arrived here, and have from him received what your Worships sent by him, but thought I should by him had more guns and liquors for the people which dayly work aboute carrying of stones &ca for the building of the Fort, which dayly relie upon me, by which reasone I am much out of pockett for the Company int[e]rest and humbly desires your Worshipps to take it into consideration. I am informed there is two interlopers belonging to the Dutch to windward. I most humbly desire your Worshipps to satisfie Leiut. Freeman what I owe him and I shall be [re]sponsable again to you."
1644,3,6,Christopher Clarkson,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,17/10/1792,Fort,RAC,"I have most humbly made bold to give your Worshipps to understand the gunns are mounted upon the flanker and do with all possibility proceed but am much detar[d]ed [= retarded] by the weather and the people being much unwilling to work, they finding not the encouradgment they expected, though I have delivered liquors of my own, by which I am much out of pockett. The slaves desire your Worshipps would be pleased to grant them there [= their] pay every two months, they finding it hard to gett provitions at this place. I have here inclosed sent what their pay comes to in 4 months, and desire you will be pleased to order Mr Johnsone for the payment of the same. I am creditably informed the Dutch Copeman at Butteroe hath profered to the Adoomes 50 bendys to procure the place [i.e. Dixcove] for them, which I humbly desire may be taken into consideration. Here is nothing done but by meer [= mere] compulsion by the natives, and severalls have deserted the place. If your Worshipps will be pleased to furnish me with more gunns and amunition I shall for the Company intrest expose my life to verry great hazards."
1645,3,7,Christopher Clarkson,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,25/10/1792,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 17th ditto I have received, which gives me to understand how
rouguisly [= roguishly] and ungreatfuly [= ungratefully] this people have dealt
with me, contrary to my desearts [= deserts], and doubt not but Ha[n]sico and Quo can and will give you to know better, so I hope I shall have no occasione to writte in my own vindication for what I have done. Being not ambitious to be starved, I must [= most] humbly desire your Worshipps to send a Factor hither the first conveniency, which will much ease me of my great trouble and expence which I am daily at here in the Companys interest and all canot give satisfaction, and thereby shall be out of danger of incouring [= incurring] your displeasure, which is not my desire. I have lent Captain Hasico 12 angles out of your Worshipps gold. I once more desire you to take these into consideration, which will satisfie me."
1646,3,8,Christopher Clarkson,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,28/10/1792,Fort,RAC,"I have most humble [= humbly] made bold to give your Worshipps to understand that the people of this place have already brocken [= broaken] their fetich taken befor[e] Hanscico and Quo by refusing to bring stons &ca. They also denie me the men I formerly had to keep watch, I being forcied to appoint two slaves for sentorys [= sentries] and we white men take our da[i]ly watch 3 hours to bring the night about, only John Pimm excepted, who not only denies it but also his work, telling me to my face I have no power to command him. I most humbly desire of your Worshipps to determine the case between us, for I have not power to restraine him from his palme wine and keeping our eniemys company. I had with your leaves raither [= rather] want his company then he persist in his erorrs [= errors], I desire your worshipps would be pleased to lett the slaves have their pay, for it is deficult [= difficult] here to gett canky. I can allow but 2 heads of corne a month for myself and the rest. I have no more then half one barrell powder left to defend your interest if occasione should happen. The Dutch slaves are here very insolent in stopeing [= stopping] your letters and comeing in pretence to drinck and dance in the town and after to pretend to bind and carry away as prisoner the natives of this place, all which I once more desire your Worships to consider, and I shall in duty bound in all things follow your commands."

The sloop wants much repaireing, which we desire may be done, we haveing verry good weather here, and desires you would be pleased to send by Coffee the things undemominated as soon as possible may be. We have sent down Allampo in the roome of Coffee. I should have also sent John Pimm but that without knowledge he is gone and hath inticed with him two of the sloop men, and were informed [they] have made a great many lyes, as to say we have 2 whitemen in the Adoomes camp which are comeing to ingadge the natives in these parts, by which reasone the people are afrayed [= afraid] to come & depart from hence. Upon this accompt [= account] we have this day sent some of the Companys slaves to bring them back. We desire some powder with match by the 1st conveniency, which will much oblidge us.

Jeffryes desires yett that he may show his ingenouity and by him in the sloope come down. I receive [= perceive] in your Worshipps information to me the Generall of the Mina hath gave you to understand ourslaves with the Dickies Cove people hath abused their slaves, which is altogither faboulus [= fabulous]. I have also received from Mr Johnsone the same, and that the Generall of the Mina should say we send our servants (or Companys slaves) up and down the country to sell liquor and tobacco, which is altogither as fallse, for myself and people here I can swear and protest [neither] I nor any of our people sold never any liquors or tobacco here, nor in any part of the country, and accordingly have sent your Worshipps both from under my own hand and all, the which they and I are ready upon your demands to windicat [= vindicate] upon our corperall oaths that no such things hath been acted to the knouledge of any white man here, and as for the coppy of the inventory of the necissarys of the Castle, I gave one to Mr White and another to Mr Elwes, but for the originall of them it is in the till of my chest, my freind the gunner haveing the key of it [omission in text?] writte to Mr Johnson, so hopeing these may suffice and most humbly desire your Worshipps to asure yourselves here shall by me nor other men here nothing acted but what you shall have a just accompt by me.

I here [= hear] the Generall of Cape Trees Pintas hath sent two Cabbosheers to the Generall of the Adoomes to treat about a peace, but hear not where they are. We are very bad, noone being better then another, not one being able to help another, we haveing feavers and agues. Out of the 5 men we have not one able to fire a gun, neither can we gett provitions for money, being forceid to fast here sometimes 4 or 5 dayes togither to live without sustinance. I humbly desire your Worshipps to take these into consideration and if possible send a man fitt for service, and as for John Pimm he shall come down in the sloope.

So haveing nothing more of importance but returneing your Worshipps most humble thanks for your care of us."
1651,3,13,Christopher Clarkson,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,25/11/1792,Fort,RAC,"I thought it convenient to give your Worshipps to understand the news we have here [which] seems crediable [= credible] to us.

I should be verry glad if the Doctor could spare us a few unguents and implasters [= plasters] if occasione should hap[p]en, I haveing [n]one, which I question not but can make use of them upon occasion.

The Cabbosheers that drunck the fetich wants cloaths, Captain Hansico can sattisfie you how many they were that drunck. Capt. Jeffreys haveing the carpenter to fitt the sloop, which is the reasone that Mr Clarkson has not been ready to send per this canoe, which I have loaded with wood.

Two or 3 dayes agoe wrotte to Mr Johnsone to send the Black carpenter up which Capt. Jefferys had to fitt his sloope, I haveing no answer from him do presume that Capt. Jeffreys has carried him to Cabo Corsoe, if so desire you would be pleased to send him up, for want of whom the bricklayers will be forceid to lye [ms. 'buy'].

He mentioned in his letter to me that he will send him when he has done with him, and when that will be I don't know. The bricklayers can work no more upon the flanker till the carpenters work is done. Just now came into the road two Dutch interlopers."

Also received one piece reed [= red] cloth, which I desire to know what I must do with it, if for cloaths to the Cabbosheers please to advise how many must have and what you allow on each cloath. The canoes could not take in the coales, which please to send per first, with some tarras & powder, the latter which we have is damaged. Per the canoe comes William Morrell, for whom please to send me one man more, for you have had two in the room of these two you sent up before.

Lime received before is all used and we have two curten [ = curtain] walls with one flanker to point, for which if you have not sent a canoe to hand please to order some shells, which will be better then lime, for one cask makes 2 of lime. We are in great want of
maules, the iron barrs I received the smith tell me they will not make 3 that will be serviceable. There is att Cabo Corso Castle pieces of dreles [sic: = deals?] that would make good mauls if you would be pleased to send some. We have two men sick of a violent feaver, for which youll perceive per the inclosed accompt of canoe hire that I have charged 4 angles to Succondee for Doctor Hardine to lett them blood.

1660,3,22,Francis Smith,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,20/01/1793,Fort,RAC,"Here is at anchor in the road the Antilope, an interloper, Capt. Hogbeen Commander, who was formerly in the Companys service. He gives accompt of two Company shipps of force that were coming, which he says must be on the Coast by this. We have gott round with the Fort & only stay for the carpenters. We have two here, but the best is lame with the wormes, Quashe by name. If you'l be pleased to send Bastian for a month it will be a great forwarding in the building, for the rains are coming on. Pray dont fail in sending some lime & tarras, itt being to cover the roomes. In my last I gave you accompt of two men that were sick, since which all the rest are sick, soe att present here is not a man to say [is] well but the serveyour [= surveyor] & myself.
[PS] Per the canoe comes a white man who came out of the interloper. I dont think him a fitt man for this place, otherwise should have kept him till I had your further orders."
1661,3,23,Francis Smith,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,02/02/1793,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 20th and 23th past with 6 iron barrs and a cask of coales have received. In your first you mention that the sloope is at Amersa to load with shells for this place, per which conveyance you designe to send me goods for to defray the charge of canoe hier I been at, which I desire may be paid me in gold if it is but cra cra. If you send me goods they will lye and spoill, for [I have] not received a cra cra from the Blacks, since I hear they are soe poor that they would dayly pawne their childreen for money to buy themselves corne. As for the beams for the corne room its for want of carpenters we han't them ready to send down. In your last you mention that the white man sent doun [= down] affirms that the Company shipps are upon the Grain Coast, to whom I presume may no credite give to what he sayes. In the mean time if I hear any certainy of there arrivall to windward shall advise you expres[s]ly of it. Of [= on] the 21th past [I] went to Taccarado, where we may gett a considerable quantity of shells if you would but allow 3 or 4 old slaves to be there, for to gether [= gather] them and bring them to the waterside. The great Portugeeze that lay at the Brandenburghs Fort has played the rogue to windward with the Blacks, taking them with what they had on board under English coullers [= colours].
[PS] I gave the Cabbosheers the cloath, the whole piece of 19 yards. The coales you sent [received]. I have some corn at the Hill which I crave your favour that you'll be pleased to lett the sloope take in. I have bought a 11 hand & 7 hand canoes which shall send by the sloope."
1662,3,24,Francis Smith,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,07/02/1793,Fort,RAC,"This comes per the Company sloope the Swallow, Capt. Bradshaw Commander, to whome reffer you for advice of the Company shipps to the windward which he left at Axim. We haveing occasion for some coals and deall boards, have taken out of the said sloope 12 deall boards, with a small parsell [= parcel] of coales, for which haveing no orders crave your pardon.
[PS] The letter received of Franck have sent on board the ships. The carpenters work is very backward for want of one. Quashee is still lame. Mr Johnson has sent Thomas Wann but he keeps the slaves. Per the sloope comes the two canoes I advised you of before, for which gave 7 ownces."
1663,3,25,Francis Smith,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,16/02/1793,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 4th & 6th ditto have received, the 1st per the Alligator Sloope with 30 butts oystershells, 3 hogsheads tarras, 3 ditto coales, 2 whole barrles [= barrels] powder and eight quarter cask rum. Also by Capt. Jeffreys received 4o 12a 2ta gold, being what I disbursed for canoe hier on accompt of the Royall African Company. Your last mentioneing that I answer to mine of the 2d ditto, wherein I desire you may send me no goods, the Blacks being very poor, and had not seen any money since I came here, which I can safely sware [= swear], and all the people can justifie, as per the inclosed certificat, that I han't taken a cra cra, except two angles for a sheet chest. In complying with your first have put as much wood on board the sloope as Capt. Jeffreys could take in, with six beams for the corne roome, for which was forceid to take all the slaves from work, which has been a great hindrance to the building, considering the rains are so nigh at hand. Provisions being very hard to be gott, the souldiers desire you'll be pleased to order beef, bread, flower [= flour] and pease for them, and that their pay may be stopt for the same at pay day. If youll allow coals and Coffee we can make bricks to serve all the battlement. I have not paid the canoemen, which reffer till have your orders. They made 20 turns with a 7 hand canoe, each man demanding 2a per turne. Please to send some sheets and knives which if you please may pay them with.
[PS] Mr Johnson keeps the slaves, I don't know what occasion he has for them now the tank is finished. He also advised the Adoomes are marching this way, for which please to order 2 or 3 jarrs to keep water in. The slaves makes a great complaint, haveing received no pay this 18 weeks. Also received John Pimm carpenter & John Carter souldier. Please to send some looks [= locks] for the gates.

1664,3,26,Thomas Edwards,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,09/08/1793,Fort,RAC,"This accompanyes Mr Francis Smith, of whome conforme [ably] to your orders have received all the goods and stores contained in the fort of [sic] and factory of Dickeys Cove belonging to the Royall Affrican Company of England, as per inventory enclosed will appeare. As I was passing by Tackerado Roads the canoe was oversett and William Harding, who was going up to visit the sick of this place, is drowned, my 2 boys, 2 canoe men and a wench belonging to one of the slaves of this place, with all my necessarys of cloathing, & blessed be God I am delivered my selfe by the help of a two hand canoe that went along with me, though I am much bru[i]sed, which I hope will amend in time if soe be you will please to permitt any Doctor to come and looke after me. Being inable to enlarge shall conclude with my humble respects.
PS. The great canoe was saved by the canoe which took me up. She is a little splitt but may be mended. I render you my humble thanks for this your kindness of advancement to [me]."
1665,3,27,Thomas Edwards,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,22/08/1793,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday I received yours by William Marrall [= Morrell], whom you are pleased to order here to officiate as chirurgeon [= surgeon] for this & Succonde factory, for which I render you most humble & hearty thanks. I bless God I am pritty well recovered again. As to the canoe men I can impute nothing to there blame, for on a sudaine [= sudden] the sea did swell and broke ahead of the canoe, which filled her full of water, and the next did oversett her. Worke goes on as speedily as possible can be, and the Cabbosheers make the people bring stones when desired. Some of them complaine they have had no cloths and are dayly asking me for the same. There is wanting deale boards and tarras for covering the roofe and bricks for the battlements but above all oyster shells to make lyme for painting [= pointing] the walls before the latter raines come, which if not perfected will be great damage though never so great care be taken in covering it with thatch."
1666,3,28,John Rives,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,06/11/1793,Fort,RAC,"By this you will understand that I have sent you a letter which I received from the Copeman of Occady by his boy, and have sent it by this bearer. Here is three of the souldiers very sick and desire very much to goe downe to Cabo Corsoe Castle."
1667,3,29,Thomas Pilkington,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,24/11/1793,Fort,RAC,"This to convey my thanks to you for the favour of advanceing mee, it shall bee my utmost endeavour to deserve it. Mr Layton will informe you in what a condition wee found this fort, and the severe turnado [= tornado] wee had last night makes it to stand more in neede of a surveyor then to have the slaves recalled, but being it was your possitive order I have obeyed, and by the returne of these canoes you will receive them. There is sev[er]all palavers between them and the beggarly Natives, I am not able by this to give you a particular accompt, both Mr Layton and myselfe still in the dark. As to Morrells business it will bee very hard to beleive the Blacks reports altogether against a white man. Herewith goe Mr Edwards concernes, which to Mr Laytons & my amazement and mine [sic] falls short of our expectations, considering the inventory taken on the 9th August differing soe much from that of ours. Where the fault lyes I am not able to determine. If I can finde out anything hereafter that will bee for the advantage of the deceased ['s] remaines shall advise you. I have made use of some things of his, which according to Mr Layton and Doctor Hamiltons valluation amount to one ounce one angle, which I will returne to Cabo Corso as soon as setled, the particulars are expressed in the inclosed note, which I leave to your censure. I find by all hands that the white men have had no pay since their arrivall here. What they are respectively indebted to Mr Smith or Mr Edwards their owne books or accompts must make out. Your orders as to this or all other things shall bee punctually observed. If I can but get victualls I shall not doubt my health, but I am afraid of starveing if my friend to leeward will not afford mee a little helpe of provisions, this place and all about being not worth a herring or two penny chickens. If Mr Salmon can spare any eatables, shall bee extreamly obliged, for it is a great discouragment to a young factor to bee under such hungry circumstances. Here are severall complaints against one of the Royall Companyes slaves called Abraham in soe much that Captain Dickie threatens to leave the towne if hee stays. I look upon it as onely a fetch to have him sent downe, because they are indebted to him, and hee is the only person that knows what is owing to others. I should have given you a larger accompt was I not disordered by the raine that almost drowned mee in my bed last night, and therefore makes bold to referr you to Mr Laytons relation.
[PS] I understand Mr Morrell is indebted to Mr Edwards for halfe a say which hee pretends was given him. Your Worships perhaps may find out the truth."
1668,3,30,Thomas Pilkington,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,25/11/1793,Fort,RAC,"Mine of yesterdays date per Mr Layton I confirme, and hope the contents were satysfactory, wee haveing done to the utmost of our power in order thereto. What slaves are here, I have set to work to point the walls of this Fort, which work I presume will not bee long in hand. I hope it will in a short tyme suit with your pleasure to remitt mee what slaves fitting for work you can spare, that the battlements may bee raised and the work of the spur &c halfe finished may bee compleated. I hold it needness [= needless] to acquaint you with our want of boards &c., my predicessors haveing soe often renewed their advices to that purpose, and I hope when supplyes comes from England Wynnebah will not altogether put our nose out of joynt, for I live in hopes one day to see all the Royall Companyes trouble and charge here retaliated. I am bold to give you fresh assurances, I will leave noe stone unturned. Since Mr Layton's departure [I] had a very hott pallaver with the Cabbosheers about the customes, I alleadged I knew of none nor would admitt of any thing till I had advised your Worships. I perceive Mr Edwards paid none, and therefore it is you and onley you that can determine the justice of their demands, which are to the vallue of six pease. Here was three or four ablelike men slaves, which may come at ozl 8a per head, but they demanding sheets onely for them, but I haveing noe orders from you nor any quantity, and by my observation it not being customary to part with soe currant comodity everywhere, I declining any dealing till I had your orders, which both in this and whatever else will conduce to the advantage of the Royall Company shall be punctually observed.
PS. Pray bee pleased to lett mee have your orders, if any Companyes shipps are heard of to windward, [whether] I may not send their pacquett [= packet] downe to you without adviseing you of such their arrivall first. If it is your pleasure I medle with any slaves, bee pleased to lett me have some irons, here being none."
1669,3,31,Thomas Pilkington,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,02/12/1793,Fort,RAC,"Before yours of the 30th ultimo came to hands I had strictly examined all things under my charge and found some things omitted which are particularized in the inclosed note. I suppose your Worshipps are mistaken as to the number of slaves sent downe from here, you mentioning but four and twenty, whereas Mr Laytons note, a coppia whereof I have, takes notice of the names of five and twenty, for I assure you I have but ten remaineing here, whose names you have in the above mentioned inclosed, soe that by examining both together it will bee found who is wanting, if any. I presume it will bee convenient that I have one of the inventoryes returned to mee, in order to make the due additions. Your pleasure shall bee observed. As [to] your order, I shall forward the building here to the utmost. I have made some progresse already and shall continue doeing. The Cabbosheers are satisfyed with your reply as to customes, but Captain Dickie presses mee to begg a stick of you for him. I know not but it may bee deserved in a little tyme, since the report is very fresh here that their enemyes the Dedoomes [= Adoomes] have received a notable overthrow, and consequently may bee thereby inclined to peace, the effects of which few are ignorant of. I shall observe your orders as to slaves but am affraid nothing or very little but sheets will go downe. What the white men are indebted to Mr Edwards estate you will find in the forementioned note. What of his remainder here herewith is sent down, and if can finde out any thing to the vallue of a taccoe anywayes belonging to him shall advise & returne it you. Mr Edwards great canoe will not swim without mending, I will goe about it on Munday. The 3d one goes downe herewith, as also his slaves and pawnes particularized in the aforesaid paper. I have noted the price of goods in conformity in my booke, and observe the white mens sallary per month. Desire your order against next pay day, that I may sett things to rights with them, which I cannot doe without I have an accompt what hath really been paid them already by other hands.
Stores omitted in the inventory, vizt 1 great shott, 1 old spung [= sponge], 1 coller [= collar] bandileers [= bandoleer], 2 crows, 1 maule, 1 pick-ax[e], a parcell old iron about 28 lb, 1 roll of sheete lead, eight men, 2 women slaves."
1670,3,32,Thomas Pilkington,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,16/12/1793,Fort,RAC,"When your of the 11th instant came to hand I was scarce able to read it, being taken on Sunday last with a violent feaver, and what is more to my misfortune the Doctor would do his part, but it seems Cape Coast cannot finde remedyes. I hope I shall doe well againe, since this is the first time I could sitt up to writte. Worthy Sirs, I must tell you the too excessive raines creates all our sickness here, wee haveing not a dry hole to put our heads. What hath been done hitherto to this fort is no better then a cheat, and if you are not pleased to send us up some good quantity of lyme and plaster, wee must sitt still and lett this worke m[o]ulder away as oft as each shower raines. When the great canoe brings any lyme &ca bee pleased to lett Mr Edwards panyard woman Maria bee returned, here being a very fine slave kept here to be exchanged for her.
[PS] Herewith comes the female slave you wrote for. I hope you will pardon that I doe not answer all particulars."
1671,3,33,Charles Hamilton,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,21/12/1793,Fort,RAC,"This canoe comes to acquaint you that Mr Pilkington is againe relapsed into his fever, which I am affraid will carry him off. Hee doth already sometymes stammer, othertymes speak nonsense, his fever is very great. If Doctor Hayes could possibly send him up a cordiall aulep [ = julep] and some conserve made sharpe with spirit of vitriol it [ms. 'vitriolist'] would doe him a greate deale of kindness. The canoemen I have sent are those pawned to Mr Edwards. I had sent yesterday, but every hour [of the] day am confined to my pillow with a violent feaver. Let the canoe bee dispatched back."
1672,3,34,Charles Hamilton,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,27/12/1793,Fort,RAC,"These come to acquaint you of the death of Mr Thomas Pilkingon my Chiefe, hee departed this life aboute eight of the clock last night, soe according to your order of the 20th instant have secured the Royall Companyes concernes, which I have accordingly done and with as much care as if my own. Mr Pilkington his estate was by himselfe at my desire put up in a trunk and chest, which soe soon as hee dyed, in sight of three of the whitemen, [I] seal'd up both. Yett there are severall little things forgott out, but they shall bee as sure as if they had not. Those things upon him, I had much ado to keepe from the man that shifted him. pretending custome, but untill ordered by you will secure them also.




Wee are all much out of order with intermitting fevers, but Thomas Plummer and John Bird almost spent with its long continuance, the last of which earnestly desires his removeall to Cabo Corsoe, as if perhapps change of aire might do him any kindness. If I can have Mr Pilkingtons bedding vallued here, it will doe mee a great kindnesse, for comeing soe suddenly from on board, [I] have been forced ever since to lye upon a bare cott. I have been at some small expenses since his sicknesse, laid out upon necessaries for the house, defraying some charges &ca, soe give it to your consideration as to my satisfaction. What money hee had was in 3 bulses and put [in] his trunk with other things."
1673,3,35,Thomas Buckeridge,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,03/01/1794,Fort,RAC,"These may advise my arrivall at Dickies Cove the 1st instant, where with Mr John Pinck I tooke an exact inventory of the goods, merchandizes, guns, stores, amunition &ca belong[ing] to the Royal Company in this Fort and Factory, which with copia are inclosed. I also to the utmost of my power have examined into the estate of the deceased Mr Thomas Pilkington, and dide find in his trunk (according to certificate of myselfe, ditto Pinck and Mr Charles Hamilton) mkl 2oz 3a 5ta, which again is therein deposited, with addition of 15a ta_ due to him from Thomas Alner, 15a lta from John Story, ozl 0a 6ta from Henry Casey, 4a from John Bird, 4a from Thomas Plummer, 7a paid by Doctor Hamilton, and 14a sent by myselfe for one pair of shoes, one silver spoon weighing oz3 and two small sheep vallued at 9a, which sums in totall doth amount unto mkl 6oz 15a_, being all I believe due to him in these parts, or that I can at present discover. Thomas Plummer and John Bird being extreamly ill and dubious of their recovery, I earnestly according to their desire entreate leave for sending them to Cabo Corso, and that I may bee supplyed with able men in their rooms, which wee shall much want, the remainder being sickly and capable of little service. I finde this place to bee ev[er]y day decaying for want of workmen and materialls to make a progresse therein. I shall doe my endeavour and hope your assistance will not bee wanting therein. As to the effects of Mr Thomas Edwards I must humbly referr you to my next, then hopeing to satisfie you in the particulars thereof. In the mean tyme must crave a supply of powder, haveing but one barrell, soe damnified it is good for little, also some Negroe irons, without which wee cannott secure any slaves in the Fort. You will receive by the returne of the canoe all the deceased concerns, with two men slaves bought by ditto for accompt of the Royall Company, who have this morneing broake a hoale [= hole] through the prison wall, had gone near to have made their escape, all which referr to your consideration.
PS. I have per 2 hand canoe sent a man slave to bee exchanged for a woman named Mago which was a pawne of Mr Edwards, desireing shee may come per ditto canoe.
[PPS] Since my writing hereof, the Cabbosheers desired mee to keepe one of the slaves abovementioned, that they may exchange him, whereupon have not sent them both ut supra advised.
Upon the arrivall of any shipping I desire to know whether I may forward their pacquett by a canoe to Cabo Corsoe."
1674,3,36,Thomas Buckeridge,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,09/01/1794,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 6th instant with the woman pawned to Mr Edwards and the inventoryes of Dickies Cove came to hand, the latter of which, being drawne conformable to order, you will receive per bearer. Neverthelesse I do verily beleive that the Company concernes (in my former) were not at all undervalued. I notice your pleasure concerning English shipps, and shall take care to gett the sticks for hand spikes in a readiness against arrivall of the Briganteene. Thomas Plummer mentioned in my last to bee very ill departed this life the 7th instant, leaveing 11a of gold, and a small bundell of old cloths, which have sent by the canoe, the money being inclosed. I hope you will not forgett to supply mee with some whitemen in roome of the deceased and John Bird, whome shall send downe by Capt. Bradshaw, the other three remaining being forced the greatest part of the day to keep their beds, soe that should there bee any occation I have not a man fitt for service in the fort. I have sent you the man slave which in my last I mentioned the Cabbosheers have a designe to exchange, and crave your orders for to purchase others, if they shall offer. As to the estate of Mr Edwards I have stopt from the whitemen for his accompt oz3 13a 2ta, with addition of 7a 2ta, a debt from myselfe, shall send you on order. I enquired of Mr Johnson concerneing a memorandum of debt at Succondee which Mr Edwards left with him, and hee told mee that Cape Coast Toms son liveing at Batteroe was indebted to him 12a. Taccabas brother did owe him something, but how much hee could not tell me, for that Mr Edwards on his comeing from Cabo Corsoe tooke the paper from him, and imployed Mr Rives therein. As to the former the Copeman of Butteroe hath panyard him for mee, whose money when I receive shall give you an accompt off, and for the two boys Kinney and Benney released by Mr Pilkington Captain Dickie (as himselfe and the Cabbosheers doe testify) did pay oz2 4a to ditto Pilkington for their releasement. Dickie also promises that that if he cannott gett the boy Will, which run away, to Succondee himselfe by fair meanes, he will paniar some of Occady people on his heade and bring them to mee for satisfaction. Hee hath importuned mee for a cane which Mr Pilkington promised you would send him. Alsoe the rest of the Cabbosheers doe expect dasshees for Christmas, wherefore I desire you will please to lett me know what customes or dashees these people are allowed, that I may governe myselfe accordingly. Per the Briganteene bee pleased to supply mee with some Guinea cloat[h]s and with powder on accompt of the Royall African Company. If ships arrive I desire to know whether I shall send downe the packett or not. In my last I committed an error in forgetting to send money for Mr Pilkingtons case, which I had taken to myselfe, and did disigne then to bee accomptable for itt. As for pewter I thought it had been putt in the canoe, but have since understood that his boy Jack carried away two plates and a spoon, soe that there is noe more then one small dish, 3 old plates, I tankard and spoone remaining, which being worth little, Mr Pilkington had them into the bargaine of other things hee bought of Mr Edward[s], wherefore for them and the case have sent inclosed 5a, being what they are worth. As for what goods you doe not finde disposed in his books, I cannot discover anything of them, wherefore with many thanks for your late favors, I shall conclude."
1675,3,37,Thomas Buckeridge,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,25/01/1794,Fort,RAC,"This serves to enclose 3 letters which iust [= just] now I received from the Commander of a Barbadoes interloper named the Supply, who came to an anchor (at Cape Mountserrado) in company with Capt. Shirley in the East India Merchant and Capt. Phillips in the Hanniball, a ship of 36 gunns, where hee left them cutting of new masts, the latter haveing fought a Frenchman of warr (near the Canaryes) of 48 gunns, by which hee received much damage, as also the other by bad weather. Capt. Richard Bradshaw in the Swallow Briganteene arrived here last night. In your last letter I am ordered to cutt a great quantity of timber, which by reason of our carpenters lameness, who hath not been able to stand upon his leggs these 10 dayes, as also two more of our slaves, I cannott effect, nevertheless shall send what I can gett ready, and I must needs say Mr Pilkington was very much overseen in chuseing out of 35 slaves which were here such sorry ones for to continue at this factory, two of them being boys and one old fellow of little or noe service, whereas considering the work wee have in hand to finish the fort, as also that of cutting tymber, wee ought to have able slaves, as also a greater number, with more workmen, otherwise I fear wee shall not finish our work before the raines, the floors of all our roomes being yett unlaid, our walls not pointed, our curtaine walls and ports upon our battlements not raised, as also them not tarrased. our hall not covered other then with thatch, besides a small tower (which it will be necessary for us to have) not built, as also severall doors and windows to make, all which shall referr to your consideration what tyme our carpenter and bricklayer with 3 or 4 slaves will bee a finishing, for which wee shall want a great quantity of deels [= deals], with nails, with hinges both for doors and windows; therefore if upon arrivall of the shipps you please to order them to put on shore such d[e]ales and other things as wee want, as also if you would please to spare us the surveyor for two or 3 weeks, with more slaves and workmen, it would mightily forward us, for indeed if the slaves which Mr Pilkington sent downe were here, they would not want imployment. Whereas you was advised by ditto that hee had furthered the building much, I must needs say it was not true, for there had not beene anything done therein a great while for want of lime and other necessaryes, which now wee have, wee shall want people."
1676,3,38,Thomas Buckeridge,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,06/02/1794,Fort,RAC,"This accompanyes one Peter James, who about 4 days since was discharged the Barbadoes interloper mentioned in my last, and being desirous for goeing for Cabo Corso hath procured his passage in a canoe bound from hence thither, by whom thought proper to advice my receiving from on board the Swallow Briganteene four barrells gunpowder, three hundred Guinea clouts, and forty butts oystershells, with some bricks for covering the Fort. Our carpenter is not yett in a condition to work, and I feare hee will continue soe for a while, wherefore unlesse he amends before the vessell goes from hence, cannot send him on board to ca[u]lk her. Our slaves being few in number, and them none the best, have had work enough, notwithstanding the assistance they have had from the Townes people, in bringing on shore the goods, shells and bricks abovementioned, and it is more then they can doe to bring wood and water to the Fort for our owne use, wood to burne our lyme with, water for mixing it, besides working it with swish, and makeing it fitt for use, alsoe a great deale of other worke, which they are every day about, wherefore unless you will please to send 6 lusty slaves more to abide here, I can make but very little progress towards finishing our Fort, much more be able to cutt the tymber & wood you expect, for I must needs say there is now almost as much occasion for the slaves you sent for from hence as ever, the country people beeing a rowsawing. and therefore not able to give us that encouragement, it being a great while since they have had anything given them more than a little liquor, which they doe not vallue, wherefore I desire you will please to furnish mee with a piece of red or blew [= blue] cloth that I may give to such as I finde deserveing and promoters of the Royall Companyes interest. I gave them the answer you wrott mee concerning their customes, with which they were not contented, saying it would be a great charge for them to goe for Cabo Corso, and that you might deferr finishing the Fort as long as you pleased, wherefore if it should bee your pleasure to lett mee know what you thought it necessary to allow them, I could make an agreement (on the Royal Company and your behalfe) injoyning them on such considerations to which services may bee advantageous to ditto Companys interest, and send you, which I beleive might bee very instrumentall in bringing a trade that may help to defray the charges of building This place will also require a linguist who may bee serviceable in procureing trade, which they of Occady and Butteroe are not without, wherefore am apt to beleive my endeavours to bring some here in little tyme will take effect, provided you will grant your assistance and some thing to send as a dashee to such great men in the country as wee must be beholding to for them. Francis Fitzgerald hath been here since Sunday was seaven night last, but could not hear any news of the shipping, 6 dayes haveing been continu'd soe foggy wee could not see a musquett shott from us. If I had not had the 5 hand canoe of Francks, and the old 7 hand canoe which was Mr Edwards, I should not have gott our things on shore from Capt. Bradshaw, for his men did absolutely refuse bringing them in their boate, neither will they take anything off therein, soe that whatever I send on board must goe of in canoes.
PS. If you should want any great canoes, I believe I may sometimes have an opportunity to purchase them, wherefore desire your order and that I may gett one for the use of this Factory. Our flagg is rotten, it will not hoyst the staff, wherefore desire another."
1677,3,39,Thomas Buckeridge,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,27/02/1794,Fort,RAC,"This accompanyes Capt. Richard Bradshaw in the Swallow Brigantine, by whome goes the surveyor and John Bird soldier, who through sickness is uncapable of serving the Company at this place, the former of which can give you an accompt of what will bee wanting to finish the building, to whose advice therein I shall referr you. By the vessell goes likewise 290 peices for handspikes, 6 slyding pieces, and aboute 9 7 hand canoa loads of firewood, being what I could procure with the small assistance I had, the Company slaves being imployed at home, that Mr Clarkson might give them some instruments and forward us something while hee was here, the canoemen you ordered to cutt wood haveing afterwards but litle time and then not willing to take the paines, the country being a rowsawing, and indeed unwilling to work any longer for a little liquor, unless the agreement aforementioned were concluded on, and I beleive to have a trade, encouragement must first bee given before wee can receive any. As for a linguister, I believe such a person will bee absolutely necessary, upon any palaver whereby the Company interest may bee concerned, [otherwise] my neighbor (who [i.e. the Dutch] have at all their factoryes such & more assistance) will gett the better of mee. You will receive also 50 fathoms 5 inch rope, 170 4 inch ditto, a parcell of blocks and eyes, some junck, an anvill, a pair of smiths bellowes with tooles & bricklayers ditto, some rigging of the sloopes, two sacques [= sacks], two anchors, I windlass. The sailes, haveing in Mr Edwards and Mr Pilkingtons tymes been layed in a place which was not light, they were soe rotten as not to hold the takeing up, where [= were] but as much as will cover my powder, wee have throwne away, as you may bee better satisfyed per bearer, per whome you will receive 4oz 4a 6ta, being the estate of Mr Thomas Edwards, according to myne of the 9th last instant, with addition of 4a for his canoe, being what or more then shee was worth, being now not fitt for any service, nobody dareing to venture in her soe farr as the road, wherefore hope you will please to allow another for Factory use. I have also sent 5 musquetts and 1 blunderbuss, which desire you will please to have mended, they being very much out of order, and not fitt for service. The fellow mentioned to bee in irons at Butteroe for 12a oweing to Mr Edwards, I have freed to Mr Johnson, who promises to bee accomptable to you for that money. Sirs, both the men you sent up last are violently ill of a fever, in soe much that I fear they will not live, and another of them is uncapable of service, wherefore I desire now you have a supply from Europe you will please to send mee 5 or 6 men more, which will bee as litle as well can bee kept in such a Fort as this, soe farr from magazine [= medicine] and sickly, also that you will please to send a man capable of lookeing after our gunns. and allow of him to bee a Serjeant, which will bee a great security and ease to mee, should I bee taken ill, and indeede this place will require them farr more then Annamaboe or soe much as Accra. Here is a man whose name is Thomas Alner. who hath served the Company eight yeares, being the eldest stander at the place, a civill person and capable of such preferment. One of the women slaves hath a very ill quality of runing away when there is any worke to doe for her to doe [sic], which in the former Chiefs tyme she hath practised, as also twice since my arrivall here, the last [time] shee was 15 dayes before I could hear of her, and at length was taken by some belonging to Mr Johnson at Succondee with 6a charge, wherefore desire another in her room, for shee is not at all a fitt woman for the place. I left a cott behinde mee, when I came from Cabo Corso, which I have had since my first comeing in this country, to which I had expended some money in fixing a bedsteade fitt for curtaines which I have now by mee, desireing you will please to send the same up here, [there] not being a cott fitt to lye upon in the fort, they being rotten and torne, soe that without I have one from Cabo Corso [I] shall bee forced to lye upon the ground."
1678,3,40,Thomas Buckeridge,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,16/03/1794,Fort,RAC,"The occasion hereof is to acquaint you that a little before day break this morneing the greatest part of our easternmost curtaine wall tumbled downe through the excessive raine which fell this night, which likewise soe much endamaged a flanker adjoyning thereto, that unless there be some speedy remedy the next showre [= shower] if not before it will undoubtedly be in the same condition, being already very much settled & crackd from top to bottom. Wherefore desire you would please to send some assistance by first oppertunity, otherwise the raine will very much endanger the whole building, the slaves wee have being not able to performe the fourth part of the worke, which had you supplyed me with when first desired our walls had before now been secured and this mischief prevented. The Castle hath been covered by the surveyour or my predecessor with none other then swish, except some lyme and tarrass that hath been wasted thereon, which notwithstanding [the rain] peirces through, soaks into our walls and cause them to fall, which covering wee are forced to throw off and place bricks in roome, part being already downe, and the rest above soe fast as the worke it occasions can be dispatched."
1679,3,41,Thomas Buckeridge,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,23/03/1794,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 19th instant, with Edward Littingston Serjeant, Richard Richardson & John Brittain bricklayers, likewise 9 men slaves, I received. Desireing you will please to advise what advance money is allowed the foremost, as alsoe what will be the others pay. I shall hasten the finishment of our breach as fast as I can, the flanker mentioned in my last being come downe, and shall endeavour (according to the little knowledge I have in such affairs) securing ourselves for the future from the like disasters. I suppose the surveyor has acquainted you with what will be required to finish the Fort as to the number of deals, bricks &ca, to which I shall add that if you please to spare 7 chaldron coals I beleive we can in this place make a sufficient quantity of the latter to serve our turne, of which we shall want a great quantity to raise the ports and curtaine walls round our battlements, alsoe to cover some parts of the Castle, which we cannot with our present number, and to finish the spurt [= spur], desiring you will be pleased to send us what shells you can, some whereof with little dificulty can procure from Tacaradoe if you please to allow charge of canoe hire, alsoe 12 paire of hinges for doores, 24 pair ditto for windows, some staples, bolts & nailes of all sorts. Sirs, I am continually baited by Captain Dickie & other Cabbosheers for his cane [ms. 'canoe'] and the agrement you promised to make with them, wherefore desire to know your pleasure therein per next. I have sent by the 13 hand canoe 46 knees according to order, and should yesterday have dispatched her had it not been for bad weather."
1680,3,42,Thomas Buckeridge,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,03/05/1794,Fort,RAC,"By this canoe goes one man slave on accompt of the Royall African Company of England, and is to desire you that you will please to spare mee 3 lb or 4 lb weight of beefe & send per returne thereof, provisions at this place as yett by reason of the late warrs and present rains being somewhat scarce, unless corne, of that here is plenty enough, should you have occasion, at la_ [var. la] per chest. The breach which was in our curtaine wall is made up. Alsoe our flanker is brought within four foot of its height, and would before now have been finished had not our bricklayers sickness and bad weather, which obliged us rather to secure what was standing than to work upon that which could take noe further harme, prevented us. Sirs, the brick[s] & lyme which came by the Briganteen are near expended, wherefore shall only presume to lett you know that we shall yett want a great quantity of each, wherefore supposing the surveyor hath particularized the same unto you I shall not further enlarge.
[PS] I desire you will please to send me two chests of sheets, some blue Welch plaines & English woollen carpetts on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England."
1681,3,43,Thomas Buckeridge,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,10/05/1794,Fort,RAC,"Since my last of the 3d instant our flanker, being raised to the height of its covering, tumbled downe againe, whether through the bricklayers ill carr[y]ing it up or through the excessive raines I knowe not, but notwithstanding they are both very idle & careless, giveing me very much trouble, I am apt to beleive it was occasioned by the latter, it being raised (sutable to the rest of our fort) with nothing but swish (except the coynes [= quoins] or corner stones that were layd in morter), which untill it be covered and well pointed will not endure any wett, soe that unless it be built with lyme we must lett it alone while [= until] the raines are over, and goe about some other worke. Neverthelesse thought fitt to advise, as alsoe that I have bought a 11 hand canoe for the Companys accompt, desireing to know what I shall doe with her, as alsoe whether you will please to have Quashee putt knees in her here or, when she goes for Cabo Corso, send them to be put in there. By this canoe you will receive a man slave for ditto accompt.
[PS] I desire you will please to give me leave to come for Cabo Corso the latter end of the next month in order to make up my accompts.
Yesterday in the afternoon passed by this place two Danes Company shipps.
I have correspondence with a great Cabbosheer to windward of Axim who will furnish me with great canoes, and promises in a little time to send traders, wherefore if you please to allow of something to be given him as a dashee, it will be much to his encouragement and I beleive beneficiall to the Companys interest."
1682,3,44,Thomas Buckeridge,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,20/05/1794,Fort,RAC,"This with the 11 hand canoe accompanying a pacquett which yesterday was sent from Cape Trespointas. I may advise my receiving yours of the 14th past taxing me with negligence, and that the falling downe of our flankers with other ill convenien[ce] doe ensue thereby, wherein I am very much wronged, as all our people can testifie, for nothing which lay in my power towards secureing and forwarding the Castle hath been omitted, and it hath been my particular care to cover our walls with thatch, which notwithstanding you blame me about, but since I am oblidged to defend my selfe in your good opinion. I shall declare nothing but what your reason will satisfy you to bee true, that our wall & flankers falling at first, as alsoe since my last great part of our spurrs & the flanker adjoyning, being well pointed & covered with tarras, hath happened through their ill raiseing with nothing but dirt, which will not bind, and in very great raines as are usuall here, continuing four or five dayes without cessation, growes naturally damp & slipery, whereby if one or two stones slide great parte if not the whole wall follows, whereas if that diligence you thinke wanting in mee had been used by others the Castle might have been built with strong mortar and made durable against all weather, by reason of a quantity of shells almost sufficient to have done this worke which I have lately found about 2 miles off, which will cost noe more bringing of them to hand per canoes then than what you pay at Amersa per butt, if you please to order it, which had they been used at first would have saved all this & a great deale more trouble which may happen, alsoe the Royall Company a great deale of money. As for the bricklayers whither they doe there worke as they ought to doe, I am not a competent judge, wherefore if anything happens amisse through their ignorance or willfullness it will not be my fault. I wrote of the 23d last instant that I could procure shells if you would allow the charges of a canoe hire, which you did not answer, wherefore shall make bold to add that if you intend to finish your Fort there most be both workmen and materialls, otherwise in one or two raine tymes more it will wholy come downe, unlesse you shall bestow as much worke thereon as being imediatley followed would in four or five months tyme finish it, and put a stop to any further trouble, in order to which if it shall be your pleasure I desire you will answer the contents of yours dated the 7th past soe soon as you can, sending us the iron worke wrote for, with deales, and if you can spare some bricks or coles, otherwise haveing time shall make what shift wee can, but in a little time shall be put to a stand for want of deales. John Storey comes by this conveyance, in whose roome desire another man, and that you will please to lett me come for Cape Coast next month, my left hand being lame, for which shall want the Doctors assistance."
1683,3,45,Thomas Buckeridge,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,15/06/1794,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 31st of May came to hand with all therein mentioned, saveing the contract I should make with the Cabbosheers that I did not receive, wherefore desire you to send it per returne of this canoe, and that thereby you will be pleased to furnish me with some money for bearing factory charges, haveing allready disbursed of my owne soe much as conveniently I can. I suppose before now you have been advised what hath happened at Succondee, and hope you will not pass over soe great an injury without satisfaction, which will expose the Royall Companyes concernes, alsoe the lives of their Factors and other servants, to the mercy of the Negroes, or worse of the Dutch, throughout this country. The English have yett friends enough in these parts to punish the insolency of their enemies if you encourage and protect them in time, otherwise thro fear they will be forced to stand for the other party, who allready threatens them. They all looke upon you, & one Cabbosheer of this towne, who hath been most usefull towards building of this Fort, and [whom] Ashrevy hath declared he will destroy, by reason he would not goe nor suffer his people to help him in this


warr, will be ready with upwards of 200 fire armes. Here are others who promise & will take fetishes to doe the like, soe that in a very short time you may have a farr more force than the Dutch, and indeed may have farr more people to take your part, if you will stand by them, than they. Therefore if you please to omitt other means, you may make use of this to be paid for what damage has been done, to serve our neighbours as they have served us, and for the future to secure our interest in this country. Mr Barter, who knows more hereof, can satisfie you further. I shall observe the contents of yours.
[PS] I have sent downe 3 unserviceable musketts, and the five we have remaining are much out of order, wherefore desire a supply of new ones and of the necessaries undermentioned:




vizt
carthriage [= cartridge] paper



twine



match



skinns for spunges



half a dozen rammer heads



a half houre glass



one or two worming irons



threed and scupper nailes



a lanthome [= lantern], with a ladle for minion gunns.




And if you would please to send a sufficient person for a gunner, also some ammunition, swords & collers of bandiliers. We have never a flagg. Please not to forgett more deale boards by first oppertunity."
1684,3,46,Thomas Buckeridge,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,21/06/1794,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 16th instant by George Clune with the stores therein mentioned, save a lanthome, and the contract came to hand, which upon perusall I finde not be authentick for this place, wherefore desire to know what present payment you are willing to make, there being upon conclusion of that agreement 10 perpetuanoes & 10 plaines, alsoe what ground rent you will allow Captain Dickie, and what dashees of liquor & goods you will pay to the Cabbosheers at danceing time and Christmas, which when I am satisfied in shall draw the contract as much to the advantage of the Companye as I can. There are one or two Cabbosheers of great power in the country adjoyning who are & will stand our friends, who I think fitting to comprehend in the agreement, and if you would please to send me something to give him a cloth, as alsoe allow 4 or 5 every year to be disposed on such as are deserving, it would doe very well and not turne to the Companyes loss in the end. Yesterday came a greate canoe with six souldiers, 166 lb beefe, three gallons sweet oyle, 6 ditto pease, and _ ane anchor [= anker] palme oyle, which doth extreemly encourage Dickies Cove people and all which take our parts. Ashrevy I understand hath both declared and taken a fetish he will come here, and on the contrary all the people under this Fort have taken fetishes and severall Cabbosheers of great force in the country that they will fight for the English to the last man, whome [= who] if they continue true, as I have all the assurances imaginable, we have twice the force of our enemies, and are able to drive Ashrevy out of this country, without doeing of which [we] must never expect trade or security here. The Brandenburghs have declared for us, panyard severall, and drove the rest our enemies friends out of their country, and have sent me word that upon any warr comeing here they will send both the Cape Trespointas and Occoda men to our assistance. I am very well satisfied the Dutch are the only and sole causers hereof, our enemy being freed by them, fighting under a flagg given by my neighbour Copeman, most of the men raized by him and the Generalls boy with the Companys stick, who [= the Dutch Copeman] hath been an actor through this tragedy, and againe the Companyes goods, the jaw bone of Mr Johnson, with some of the Company slaves, linguister & Captain of the towne are brought & keept in Butteroe Castle, which if you suffer to pass without satisfaction it will be an eternall shame for us. If you please to send some Cape Coast blacks to head these country people wee may make a des[c]ent into Butteroe Towne, which harbours all our enemies, and panyar Ashreveys wives and severall of his friends, whereby you may regaine Succondee and be paid for all damage, likewise secure our selves for the future without proceeding to fight with him,which if you please with such assistance shall be strong enough to doe. Sirs, in my last I wrote you for money to bear Factory expence, which upon my word I very much want and cannot make any shift without, haveing been forced to send what little I had to redeem some of our Cabbosheers children which lay in pawne for some moneys they owed the Dutch, who by reason of their takeing our parts threatened to send away their children if not imediately redeemed, which I have done, and hope I have thereby wholly brought over one Cabbosheer mentioned to promise assistance of 200 fire armes to our interest, haveing the same children for my security. Wee shall want some nailes & pitch, with some canvas to make baggs for carthadges.
[PS] I wrote you the 10th last instant and there[by] sent you a good man, whose receipt you have not advised of.
All blacks are madd to have your orders for fighting Ashrevy and gaining satisfaction, otherwise they say they shall be much ashamed. You may use this oppertunity of gaining Commenda. Herewith comes 14 granadoe shells."
1685,3,47,Thomas Buckeridge,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,25/06/1794,Fort,RAC,"In my last of the 21st past I wrote you severall matters requireing an answer, which haveing not yett received, this comes express therefore, alsoe to advise by report of some country people fled to Butteroe a great party of the Adooms are come downe into Ancosa country, which is less than a dayes journey from these parts, intending to make an attempt on Butteroe Castle in revenge of the injury hath been done to Succondee, which they say did belong to them. This hath putt my neighbour into a great fright, in soe much that he keeps at strict watch in his towne and expects a reinforcement of Mine Blacks tomorrow or next day. Now whether the brute [= bruit] of the Adooms be spread abroad purposely by the Dutch for a colourable pretence of raiseing men & gaining more of this country to take their part upon some new designe they may have, I know not. I have this day burnt a killne of 33 butts shells, charges whereof come to la per butt, with which I am againe setting to worke. If our breaches were rebuilt, our hall covered, our tower raised, alsoe our curtaine walls & ports about our battlements, with water, provision & ammunition, we are able to withstand all the Blacks in Guinea, which I hope may be compleated by Christmas if wee have but your furtherance therein. We want deale boards & nailes of all sorts with what last wrote for.
[PS] Just now came all the Cabbosheers of Dickies Cove croomes, and have taken fetishes to stand by the English.
Our Gunner had the chance to blow up his hand & face with powder the other day, which is yet something troublesome to him, wherefore desire the Doctor may send us some salves & unguents for wounds or sores if any mischance should happen. Edward Nowell on Saturday morning was surprized with a fitt, and spake not till this afternoon.


pitch
salves & unguents
shovells
nailes a good quantity
more bolts for windows and some great ones for doores
deale boards
stock locks & spring locks, alsoe padlocks
Richard [i.e. Richardson] the bricklayer hath 7 peeze owing him from Mr Clarkson, which he humbly desires you will please to receive & secure for him, being absent."
1686,3,48,Thomas Buckeridge,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,03/07/1794,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 27th last instant I received by return of my canoe and of the 29th by the 11 hand ditto, with the necessaries therein mentioned and 11 black souldiers. I am very glad you are resolved to punish Ashrevy for the villanies he hath committed, which being performed will turne very much both to your owne and the Royall Companyes honour and interest. I could wish you had wrote me to what vallue the dashees you order me to be given should amount to, for my government therein, nevertheless hope to give content on both sides. Had I been either to[o] rash or severe, soe ma[n]y Cabb[oshee]rs and of soe great power would not upon my single request have taken fetishes to defend my self and Companyes concernes to the last man. As you have been pleased to place me in an imploy of some trust and creditt my actions shall be correspondent thereto, and tho I may advise of the power I imagine you may gaine in this country to revenge the injury [which] have been done to us and for the future to bridle the insolency of our enemies, shall doe nothing therein without your positive order therefore, which to execute no danger shall affright me. as being the Companyes servant I hope you will not suffer me to be abused. Inclosed goes my accompts for six months from ultimo December 1693 to ultimo June 1694, ballance amounting to mk4 7oz 13a 10ta due to factory charges.
[PS] When the agreement is concluded shall send you a coppy thereof, alsoe duplicates of my accompts so soon as have time to write them.
When any great canoe comes this way please continually to send deale boards in her bottome while we have a sufficient number to worke with."
1687,3,49,Thomas Buckeridge,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,17/07/1794,Fort,RAC,"With this you will receive the contract [var. 'compact'] made with the people of Dickies Cove, which by reason of my illness hath been deferred soe long. My accompts I suppose you had per last. Ashrevy is againe come to Butteroe, where he hath been a considerable while, the women whereof have every night slipt [= slept] under the Castle walls, and the canoe men gone up the river, while within this day or two, for fear of our attempting to cutt them off, some of [the] Cabbosheers have offered themselves to serve you against any enemy whatsoever, and desire they may not be thought backwardly, when they are resolved to follow your orders, either in continueing at home or goeing to fight, and if you were pleased to cause them to attempt something against the Dutch interest it would be a means to make them stand more firmly to us. I beleive if you sent encouragement to Jappo, Ashrevys enemy, and procured what people you can to joine with him, you might soon have an army to retake Succondee and severely revenge the murther of Mr Johnson, which if you doe not doe and that Blacks perceive you soe little vallue the lives of your Factors, in a short time more it will grow to a common practice and yourselves may not be altogether free. You will never advantage the Company by not punishing the murtherers of their servants, but day by day you will find their interest decrease thereby. The warrs between the Dankeraes and Awomweyes [continue?], and indeed soe much that some of the former have been downe att Butteroe, one of which came hither and bought what perpetuanoes I had remaining, and told me from the others that there were a great many traders come downe to Impoho country, which upon their second returne should be to Dickies Cove, and [would have] been then but for want of [a] way to be cutt through the bushes leading hither, which our Cabbosheers have promised to goe about on this side if they will doe the like on the other. With the lime I burnt the other day have raised our port walls upon our largest flanker towards the sea, 18 inches thick & 7 foot high, there being five ports, and roome enough for soe many good saker gunns. I am now about our other battery, haveing raized the foundation and laid it anew, and other needfull worke in the Castle. By reasone of this warr with Ashrevy I cannot goe to one of the places where I should have gott shells, and in the other there is not above 40 butts remaining, soe that we shall in a little time be att a stand unless you will be pleased to desire leave from the Brandenburgh Generall for us to goe up the River of Occada, where there are enough, and I am confident upon your request he will lett us take what we shall have occasion for.
[PS] On Munday was sevennight last Ashrevy and Finney, two of the Cape Coast men you sent me, without my leave or knowledge tooke a very good large & new canoe which one of this towns people had lately bought for fishing, and went away with her either to Cabo Corso or some other place, the owner whereof makes a great complaint and demands satisfaction. Besides two of the 13 [var. '15'] Blacks you mentioned did not come, which I hope you will not lett cheat you of the money you gave them.
Pray send a great canoe with boards, a lanthorne & shovells."
1688,3,50,Thomas Buckeridge,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,31/07/1794,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 28th instant came timely to hand with advice of Anta Ashrevys intention to surprise this place, which had he endeavoured accordingly I doubt not but should have given him a repulse. I have had severall false allarmes, and am sensible that he dayly threatens and wants not good will to cutt us off, which makes me keep a good watch and take all the care imaginable, by which means hope to frustrate his designes and turne them to his owne ruine. I believe he has been dealing with some of our Cabbosheers, but I hope to little effect. He is now at Succondee, where yesterday he had a fight with Jappo and some of the Adoomes, of which last night was informed he had the better, causing the former to cutt his throat, which not being yett confirmed I hope is untrue. The Cabbosheer I mentioned to promise assistance of 200 fire armes is Jappoes cozen, who's interest is consonant with ours and therefore will be oblidged to stick to us. Ashrevy wanting to cutt him [ms. 'his'] & all his relations, soe that if this news be true he will endeavour I believe to raise an army to fight his enemy, upon whose approach to Butteroe [he] sayes he will send for all his friends hither, and put them in armes. Sirs, by reason of this warr cannot gett more shells, for which our work is at a stand, as alsoe want of boards, which if we have not to secure our building before the next raines I know not what will become thereof. Since my last have been very ill, which occasions me not to send duplicates of my accompts, alsoe want of inck & paper. Last night deceased Richard Barker soldier, his things not being sufficient to pay his debts. Sirs, I forgott in my former letters to advise that upon opening the bale of plaines three of them were much damaged & wett with salt water & rotten. I received yours of the 19th instant with twenty five blue perpetuanoes and ballance of my accompts.
[PS] The Dickies Cove people assisting Ashrevy are not returned, their wives & children flying away so soon as we heard he had."
1689,3,51,Thomas Buckeridge,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,04/08/1794,Fort,RAC,"This morning the Cape Coast men you sent me being in drinck, & haveing a quarrell with some of the town's people, Quomina, who comes in this canoe, was killed by them, being shott in the groyne [= groin], upon which they all fledd, [with] their wives & children, save Billy, the Cabbosheer aforementioned, and them belonging to him. The occasion was through our souldiers panyaring of two fowles, which being refused by the owner, caused one of them to give him a cutt over the shoulder with his sword, which notwithstanding I sent word I knew nothing thereof, and would cause satisfaction to be given to the person, they were resolved thereupon to leave the place, getting together in armes, whereupon sending my people to stop them, and intreat them to stay untill they had a right understanding of the matter, they killed the party above mentioned, whose death his companions in the heat of blood revenged on one of them, which is all I know thereof. I am apt to beleive that, notwithstanding their feteeches and fair promises, they have been corrupted by Ashrevy while he was att Butteroe (whose Copemans boy was here just before the mischief happened), and wanted but a plausable pretence to play the rogue. I shall want two chests of sheets, which please to send me.
PS. Since writeing hereof I received yours of the 2d August with the things therein mentioned, save the paper. Jappo is liveing & well att his croome, haveing killed a great many of Ashrevy's army, especially Dickies Cove men. I can have noe certainty of the news, for the Dutch spread abroad false storyes, and endeavour to conceal the truth as much as they can, only I understand he caught them sleeping before break of day, makeing three attempts on them, whom he drove severall times round the Dutch Fort, which fired att him. I have sent two unserviceable musketts. We have others that looke indifferently well to the eye, but the screws are worn out."
1690,3,52,Thomas Buckeridge,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,11/08/1794,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 6th instant by Cape Coast Tom I received, wherein I find it's myselfe must beare the blame, though others in the fault. It is true I have severall times writt you that I had all the assurance could well be required of these peoples fidelity to the English, they haveing taken feteeches thereon, and made all the protestations imaginable, sufficient to have deceived a more experienced person than I am, notwithstanding all which if they will play the rogue, can I help it? In my last I advised that 2 or 3 of the Cabo Corsoe soldiers had a quarrell with a man or two belonging to one of our Cabbosheers about panyareing a fowle, the former thereupon giveing one of the others a small cutt over the shoulder, which I knew nothing of till done, and that I see the people leaving the town, a very ill thing of them after their late pallaver, and positively contrary to one of the articles therein contained, not to make me acquainted therewith, but immediately thereon to leave their habitation. Nevertheless by sending some people to stopp & lett them know I was not sensible thereof, but if they were abused would cause satisfaction to be given them, they stayed a while, when after two or three houres I sent for the Cabbosheer whose man was cutt in order thereto, which he by means of another person (whome I had allways been very kind to), who is the author of all this stirr, refused and withall sent some of his people away, a thing not sufferable in these parts, to have any person liveing under a Fort not to go thereto when required, without some great reason to the contrary, which observing and hearing his answer, I sent some slaves to stay them the second time, otherwise to bring him or some of them to the Castle, when againe I see others goeing in like manner, whereupon sent our black soldiers to keep them in, upon which one fellow lay in a bush shott Quomina and all fledd, some through guilt and others through fear. It is a thing common amongst these people to leave their dwellings in a time when they are not afraid of any enemy, haveing done soe both from Butteroe and Occaday since my being here. You see that wee have the wrong, which the bearer can satisfie you in, the pallaver not concerning me. Some of them will come of their own accord, and beg pardon. You tax me with breach of your orders, which I have always observed. I fear not Ashrevy & all Anta together, the sea being att my command, wherefore since we are amongst an unfaithful I & forsworne people, your orders are very strict for the preservation of the fort, whereby I am disabled to disarme or harme such as I find to be our enemies, but must harbor snakes in my own bosome, which, haveing an advantage when they please to give the first blow, may occasion the loss of all. I am oblidged to defend the Companys interest, when you are on our enemies side, soe that I fear to doe any thing therefore, and fear not to doe, for if any thing happens amiss, the same must be thrown on me, whereby I may be ruined, upon which consideration, and that you have them more capable to manage this place than myselfe, intending alsoe to goe for England in the next shipping, if you send a person in my roome shall freely resign what you were pleased to bestow upon me.
[PS] I have sent my canoe for sheets, and desire to know what shall pay to the Cape Coast men concerning canky money. Please to send inck & paper. I desire to know what advance you allow our Gunner."
1691,3,53,Thomas Buckeridge,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,30/08/1794,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 15th instant came to hand, wherein you say I would not permitt Cape Coast Tom to execute his orders, alsoe that when this difference happened myselfe went armed with my people of the Fort, which if I deny, I hope you will not be angry, neither one nor the other is true, indeed upon consideration that I had not done these people any harme, but that myself had rather the injury, was unwilling by my submission to draw them back, least thereby I might impaire both the Companys & your honour, alsoe encourage them for the future to be guilty of the like. Nevertheless did not hinder your messenger from acting as he pleased, but did allways imagine that, not being sollicited thereto, they would returne of their owne accord, which hath since happened, they being come home begged pardon and promised to deliver up the person that shott Quomina. As for my disability to support any trouble may come upon me, I may thanck you therefore, but am not insenceable what must lye att my doore. Ashrevy with his people have been upwards 10 dayes att Butteroe. By the Fauconberg sent a man slave for accompt of the Royall Company, and desire a chest sheets by returne of this canoe, haveing per last received two ditto. Sirs, my covenanted time with Company being expired the first of Aprill last and haveing some affairs which require my return to England, desire leave to imbarque on board the shipp Fauconberg, Capt.

The traders doe expect a dashee, which I shall observe your orders therein, and the Cabbosheer of the towne [expects] 6 gallons of rumm [var. 'brandy'] at my comeing, for which I desier your orders. They promise great matters, and have sent up the countrey for the traders to come downe, which I have had every sence I have bin hear [= here], Plancks, bricks, lime are very much wanted for the securing of the Forte, of what is already built, for that round flanker that fell downe the last raines, sence I came heare hath leaked through, and [is] in great danger of falling.

You may satisfie your selfes that I will att all times observe your commands, and by what I can learne you are misinformed, for the difference [is] in a great prospect of being at an end with that Ashrewy, for he hath not 20 men, I am very well satisfied, in that yeasterday I gave our Serjant leave to goe and fecth his cloaths the taylor of Butteroe had of his, and when he came there the Castle gates where shutt upp and they had got Ashrewey and where resolved to make him pay 12 bendyes that he owed or to keep him in irons, but the Cheife took 12 of his wifes with his children and other of his relations till he does pay it, and our Serjant doth say that the Ducth [= Dutch] is very much his enemy and doe say he is a very great rouge. He saw likewise in the Chiefes roomes Mr Johnsons cane and severall other of his things. Hear is severall of these towne people that doe come to aske leave to settle heare, that have bin at the assisting of Ashrewey, and all that they can say is that if Mr Buckeridge had not gave them leave they had not whent, and are willing to take a feet[i]che or anything to come and live heare againe. I have gave some leave to build allready, and desier your orders [var: 'derections'] for the future what I shall doe therein. I never suffer not above six Blacks in at once.

The Castell is in butt a very bad condition, that is built with swish, that the raines doe wash it, that it is contenewly falling. If you could butt send one hundred butts of shells I will ashure you to secure the Forte from ever falling more. Wee are daily a pointing of it but to noe end, for it washes away one day as wee lay it on the other, that heare is not one dry place in the Forte.

I stand in great need of those goods that I wrote for. I shall use my endeavour in preserveing the Forte. I have heard that you are informed that I have bin at Butteroe, which is very false as God is trew [= true], for I have not bin two stones cast from the forte sence I have bin heare, and as for the mens goeing to the croomes is as false as the other. I doe ashure you that I will be as wacthfull as lyes in my power and obey your orders in all things. I haveing by this sent you the Serjant and have placed George Clunn in his st[e]ade and Thomas Allenner gunner.

If you will send deale boards in the cannoe I could keep the carpenters att woorke on flowering of the hall and three other roomes, for I cannot keep any goods dry in the warehouse for want of boards. Last night theire came into this road a Pourtigueze, and there being a Ducth galley and a great Ducth shipp likewise, therefore I sent my Gunner on board, that they might not take her in the rood, butt the Ducth galley fiered a shott into my canno, but the canno got on board, with that the galley manned her boats and the second of the Mina came on boards hal[f] an hour after the Gunner and demanded to [know] what he did theire, and he told them to keep the vessall from them, with that he bid him be gone or he would send him owt of her presently, that the Gunner came on shore, therefore I could not do anything more therein, thinking it might not be amiss to acquaint you therewith.
[PS] I haveing this theft to request your advise in, on Thursday the 5th day of November Cape Coast Thoms son with Ashrewey and two Cape Coast souldiers with a slave of Harries the bomboyes did att 12 a clock att night brook open the doores of one in [= of] the Cabbosheers liveing att the King of Bauduh[s] Croome about 2 miles from the Forte, and presented theire musqets att the Cabbosheer and the people of the house and demanded his back [= bag], which they presently found and brought away with them. That man and the King came to aquainte me herewith, and I sent for all the Cape Coast souldiers and slaves, that he might see them, and he found onely two of them, that was Harries slave, and [he] confesed before all the Cabbosheers that he was one, and Anshrewey was the other, which is a slave of Hansicoes of Cape Coast, confesing he was in the house, but they both deny they had any sheer [= share] in the gold or other things that was in the bagg, which the Cabbosheer value to be worth 3a, butt they say Cape Coast Toms son hath the bagg and what their [= there] was. Now this being down [= done] on Thursday night, on Friday morning the great canno whent from hence, and that Cape Coast Tom['s son] in her, and that noebody but Quashe that commands the souldiers know as fare as I can learne, and he [= Quashe] said he [= Tom's son] told him he was Yavvey, for all my boy whent in the same cannoe, yet he did not know that [ms.

The great ship with the galley lyes heare still in waite for two more Portugueze that are att the Brandenbourgh Forte. I haveing receved Cap Coast Toms sons [= son], and haveing examined him before the Cabbosheer, he hath confesed the fact and all that I charged him therewith, as also the other two that was his comrades, this being come to speake with Cape Coast Tom his father and Hansico, one being Hansicoes slaves [= slave], I haveing them all three in irons till returne of this boy with your orders, the Cabbosheers demanding three bendyes, being the custum of the country, as the Cabbosheers say, I referring myselfe wholly to you in this matter.

You may be ashured I shall not be wanting in useing my endeavoure to the forwarding of the forte, not doubting but to secuer ite [= it] before the raines. I have bin very indisposed & for this 14 days of the dry gripes and in great fear of looseing my left arme, I haveing now by the help of the Brandenbourgh Docter that hath bin with me five or six days much recovered myselfe, but have those paines left in my limbs as I cannot walke the length of my roome as yett, wherefore I refer sending my accompts this month, and as for ballance that will be none, for its as much as will pay the men, I haveing had very little trade this month, by reason of one parcell of goods I sould in and about the Copeman of Butteroe panyard and made them pay a bendy, and the others the Adoomes made the traders pay such great custum that they they sent me woord that if I could not find some other way they durst [not] venture any more, that I sent to the King of Badow, and the Capusheer and the King hath promised to open the way, that he did send foure men to show them the way, that if once cle[a]red I do not feare of a trade, which the King[s] men and my Capusheer[s] men are all at woorke theire. I desier you to send me those agrements that Mr Buckeridge did make with them Cabbosheers, for my government in this mater, and as to my sending cannoes I never sent one as yet but when I sent for goods, that I charged the Company with.
According to yours of the 5th instant I have used my endeavoure to make the theift up with the Cabbosheers, haveing with a great deale of trouble brought itt to a conclution that the Cabbosheer is to have two bendys, he haveing sent this cannoe againe for to bring the answer, I desier of you to send me woord. Ife you do not aprove of what is done here I may take my mesures, for the Cabosher is resolved to goe his way and to panyare to the valew of three bendys and six peize ife you do not agree to what I have wrote and to lett him have his money att the returne of the cannoe.
As to the Cape Coast souldiers you may withdraw them when you shall think convenient, for I will ashure you need noe way doubt of my fiedillity both to the Company intreast and the respects I ow unto you.

I would have sent two inventorys of Mr Gorings concerns by this conveyance, but had not tyme, shall not fayle to send one per next. Here is a boy which was Mr Gorings slave, soe if you please to lett me have him [I] shall give a women slave for him, which Mr Rootsey has in his hands. Mr Jordan is soe bad that he dares not venture downe in the canoe."
1712,3,74,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,24/04/1795,Fort,RAC,"This serves to advise you that on the 22d instant Mr Jordan went on board of an interloper called the Adventure in order for to take his passage in her to Cabo Corsoe, and this instant arrived here Mr Jennings, upon which we sent a canoe aboard to know whether he [= Jordan] was able to come back to assist at the inventoring the Companys concerns, and by returne of said canoe had advise that this morning four of the cloacke he departed this life, and that the Captain had according to custome in such accidents buryed him in the sea. He carried with him in one of Mr Gorings small truncks some cloaths, one ounce gold, and one of Mr Gorings shirts, of which we have noe accompt from the Captain, soe desire you will be pleased when the said Captain comes to leaward to require an accompt of him.
PS. The Dutch Galley has had a fight on Sunday last with a ship which is supposed to be a French man off of Buttroe. Mr Jennings being somewhat indisposed with stone, can give you at present no accompt of his proceedings, but by the next opportunity will not faile."
1713,3,75,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,24/04/1795,Fort,RAC,"By Mr Jennings have received the orders, and am sorry should doe any thing to displeasure you. I have with Mr Jordan deseased taken an inventory, and have put in every thing I could see or find belonging to the Royall Company, and I cannot tell how those things should be wanting which you say are, by compareing the inventory and accompt together. I hope you doe not impute those things to me, you verry well knowing that I could not by putting more or less gain any proffitt to myself, when I was to returne and the deceased to stay. As for my hindering Edward Barter from inventorying contrary to orders received, it is notoriously false in him to say soe, I only telling him that to show [how] great he had streatched his orders, however he was only ordered to proceed, and to begin whatt he had done before, but if he would take the trouble the goods were all there, and [I] preferred him the key of the other warehouse. My actions, Sirs, are soe cleare and just that I care not what eye inspects into them. As for the screw'd juggs it was a mistake by Edward Barters importunity to begone thatt they were putt downe a[s] half damadged. As for the extravagant damadges you mention, I wish Mr Jennings doe not find them more. As for the tallow, it was rated by Mr Edward Barter. Sirs, I am verry sorry that I cannot be employed upon any bussiness, but that by the information of my ill willers I must (without being heard in my owne defence) be counted a rogue. If you will be pleased to putt me in place shall be verry thankfull and show by my diligence the interest I take in pleasureing my masters whose servant I am; if otherwise, desire you will be pleased to lett the accompts between the Company


and myself be made up, and that I may take my passadge for Europe in Capt. Piles, my time being expired."
1714,3,76,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,08/05/1795,Fort,RAC,"This serves only to advise you that the canoe I sent to informe you of the death of Mr Jordan is in her returne hither piniard per Anta Shrevey, upon no other accompt then that Taggee has beat the Cufferoes, neither will he release the men or send the letter, wherfore have thought it convenient to advise you. The Dutch have a great many irons in the fire, & this place is a great eye sore to them and would faine remove out of their way, though itt were after Sucundee fashion, & in case Anta Shrevy should come against us, we are verry ill provided of every thing, haveing neither corne nor water to subsist on, therfore humbly desire you will be soe kind as to assist us with provitions &ca. All the men are downe of distemper, so that there is not four man in the fort that are able to stand on their leggs, and the fort if not better remedied will on a short time fall about our ears. Mr Jenings has been ill of the stone & feavour ever since he have been here, so desireing you will be pleased to dispatch the canoe with speed, as likwise to send your former orders by her."
1715,3,77,Richard Jennings,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,14/05/1795,Fort,RAC,"Since my arrivall I have been much aflicted with the stone & still continues. As did advise your Worships in a letter of the death of Mr Jordan, Mr Pinck & self have taken inventory what belonging to the Royall African Company & of Gorings estate, the which I here inclosed send your Worships, also what papers I have found. As for the perpetuanoes that are wanting, Peter, a Black in the towne, declares he brought traders some small time before Mr Goreing deceased that bought seventy, and the said Goring gave him a niconee & the trader a carpet to encourage them, & Francis Nixson declares that he saw thirty perpetuanoes deliver'd, & Mr Goring should say that was the remaines of the blue perpetuanoes. One lead barr he cutt into sluggs & gave the blacks with powder to burne Canconnock[s] croome. One half firking tallow he sold Peter, it being damaged, for 2a 6ta. I have examined the Serjeant & the men, who will all declare upon oath not the least thing of the Company has been deliver'd out of the warehouse from the death of said Goring till Mr Jordan & Mr Pinck came. I should have sent the serjeant downe, but he is troubled with a violent feavour & ague, & his leggs so swelled that he is scarce able to goe, and most of the men downe with other distempers, & provision so scarce that they are ready to starve. As to the Serjeant[s] paper [it] was a coppy taken from said Goring, & [he] further declare he did not know what goods was in the warehouse. As for the differences in the inventory, Mr John Pinck has disposed of some goods which he will give your worships accompt. I have further inquired after Mr Gorings estate, & am inform'd he sent two canoes with perpetuanoes to Cabo Corso Castle and consign'd them to the French Doctor, they were bought out of the interloper. Mr Goring was to pay 8mks, the French Doctor the ballance, the whole amounting to 15mks, but what returns was made I cannot learn. Further he laid out with the interloper 11oz in Cabe de Verde cloaths. What I have write concerning the Royall African Company & said Goring in the foregoing part of this letter is the best information I can give at present. Here are severall palavers about Harry the Bomboy, and the people are soe disattisfied with him that they are resolved never to bring trade to the fort till he is remov'd, soe shall keep him till further orders. The reason detaining the canoe so long was by seas being soe bad that noe canoe could goe off. When the seas being abated, intending to forward the canoe, [I] had information the Mine did panjard all the canoes that was belonging to Cabo Corso Castle. The reason which gave me to suspect it [was that] the canoe we sent to advise your Worships of the death of Mr Jordan is not returned. I have received yours of the 3d of May, & accordingly have sent away the five hand canoe with John Pinck. We have had for these eight days last past such violent rains that one of the flanckers is downe, & the rest I believe will falow [= follow] if the rains hold. The reason that I have not sent anything that belong to Mr Goring is because they will take damage, so shall referr it till forther orders. I humbly desire your Worships for God sake to send another person to take care of the Companys concerns, that I may come to Cabo Corso and not lye & perish here, for there is noe sustanance to be had. Being forced by my sickness to omitt severall things, shall referr you to the bearer.
PS. By the canoe comes two slaves & a pawne for six angles."
1716,3,78,Richard Jennings,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,31/05/1795,Fort,RAC,"My last was on 14th instant, wherein I gave you an accompt what condition the Fort was in, but have not heard from you. These are further to acquaint you in what condition we are in by the violent rains, who have scarce pleace to keep the
Company goods nor the men to lye dry. There is two flankers already downe, expecting every minuett when the others will fall, if the rains should continue. The men are in great want of their pay. I have not any mony, therfore I would desire your worships for to take some speedy care or they must starve, for the natives will not give them creditt no longer. Captain Dick makes much complaint for rent, he says he hath a twelve month due. I continue verry ill of my distempers. I humbly begg of your worships for God sake that you would be pleased to send some other person to take care of the Companys goods, and I may come downe to Cabo Corso Castle for recovery [ms. 'rerevery'] of my health & not perrish for want of releife. Worthy Sirs, if I have not got your consent I must come away without, but I hope you have Christianity in you and will consider my condition God knows is verry bad, that so I may have your worships consent. As to the trade I think it is no great matter where there is any body there or no, for I shall not take what will defray charges.
PS. A list of the mens mony & what pay they have per month."
1717,3,79,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,12/06/1795,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys Mr Jenings, by whom according to order you will receive two inventorys signed by us both. The fort is verry much out of repair, two of the flankers are downe, & part of the curtain wall, & the rest if the rains hold longer will be about our ears. I humbly desire as soon as possible you can to let the surveyor come to view it, & send up some workman, I shall gett whatt materiall I can in areadiness for them. I do designe God willing to gett another clamp of bricks made & burnt. Francis Nixson, whoe setts the clamp, desires to know what you will be pleased to allow him for his pains. I shall use my endeavours to gett what oysters shells I can to make lime, that nothing may be wanting when the workmen come. I can not at present inform you of any news in these parts, save that the canoemen that Anta Sherevy panyard he has been about of ships to sell him, but no body will buy him. I shall have a watchfull eye over Anta Shrevy & his actions, and as I hear further shall advise you. I desire you will please to send per first opportunity six chests sheets and some blue perpetuanoes if any to spare. I humble desire you will be pleased to send us up some provitions, or else we must starve, here being nothing to be gott for love or money, the people them selves being ready to devour one another. I give you my harty thanks for placeing me here, & hope by my deligence in the Company's service to merritt your further favours. The slaves Conconoko had seized on have made their escape, so that I find none wanting save Quomanay. I humbly beg if possible that you send up some body in quality of a Doctor, that can bleed & administer physick, for most of the people are ill. Hopeing you'1 consider our necessitys, and send what desired."
1718,3,80,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,15/06/1795,Fort,RAC,"This comes express to desire the sheets & perpetuanoes before wrote for, people being here with their money waiteing for them. By this canoe comes John Dobson soldier in a verry bad condition, that had he stay'd here would certainly have perished. I humbly crave your pardon for sending him downe without your orders, so desire another in his roome. By this canoe comes five old musquetts not servicable, so desire others for them. By this comes three bricks moulds, to desire you'l be pleased to send up in their rooms five new ones, & 6 plains [= planes] for bricks. At the foot hereof is an accompt of gunners stores wanting.
PS. Gunners stores: flints [ms 'tlints'], tar & brushes, cartridge paper, needles, threed & twine, skins, canvas, trucks, a pack needles, nails of [all] sort[s]."
1719,3,81,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,02/07/1795,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 21 past I received, with the things therein mention'd. I am verry sorry that I should put the Company to any unnecessary charge. All the Mine canoes [that] comes to this place informed me that the palaver was made up, & that all was quiet of both sides. The perpetuano that Mr Jenings has overcharged, he may thank him self for it, being his fault. I thought he had given you the inventorys when he [ms. 'ye'] came to Cabo Corso, for I wrote two which were signed by us both. If you pl[e]ase to trouble your self you may tind the other among his papers. I should for all that have sent another but have no paper to write one on, this being all I have, so desire you'l be plase'd to send to me some with some quils per returne of [t]his.
The occasion of my sending this is to complain of the rougery of these people, especially of Captain Need, he being so great a rougee that there is no liveing for him, he haveing desarted the towne some time agoe upon some discontent between the Cabbosheers and himself, & haveing gott others to doe the like, keeps his habitation about 3 miles off, where by his rougery he not only hinders traders but paniar all he can gett. Two or three days agoe, he & the rest sent to me, pleading they were Dickies Cove people, & desireing they mig[h]t live in the towne, & that I would send my boy to assure them no body should hurt them. I haveing at that time occasion for oyle for the forts use, sent my boy to assure them that if they would live peaceable no body should hurt them. As soon as Need had my boy he panyard him, & bids defiance to the King of Aguaffo & all that can assist the Englisch. He has him there now, & says he'l keep him till [the] King off Aguaffo comes to redeem him. He is a great rouge & may work much upon the rest, & doe us a mischeif. They all acknowledge, though the fort be downe, they can't hurt it, but they will starve us out and keep us from water. There is 3 French ships to windward, & one past by the 27th last, who tooke an Englisch ship of 28 gunns at Gambo, with 400 negroes of the Companys."
1720,3,82,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,07/07/1795,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 4th instant have received, & observe your advise concerning the differences of this people. I did what I could to have all qui[e]ted before I advised you of it. I sent a slave for water which he [= Captain Ned] has panyard alsoe, so that if they hinder us from water cannot tell what to doe. I have placed a barrells of Mr Gorings powder to the Companys accompt. The Copeman of Accoda advised me of the French ship to windeward, and the other Tomas Allner was aboard on, she being at anchor of this place, and bought the English Captains coate he was kill'd in. The French vessell is a galley of 18 oars & thirty eight gunns and one hundred and seventy men; her name is the Garden, she came here to loock for the Windhound, or any other vessell she can light on. The Captain own'd of three more vessall but could not tell whether they were [ms. 'more'] gone downe or no. I shall not fayle to be as carefull of the fort & Companys concerns as lies in my power. I should be verry glad if Taggee were in these parts to bring these people a little more to reason and honesty, for of a small company there cannot be greather rogues under the sunne. Please to send when the flagg comes a pair of halliards [= halyards] with it, for here is none."
1721,3,83,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,20/07/1795,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 9th instant I received, & have with much adoe made up the palaver & hope all things are now in peace & quietness. They have so orderd the bussiness that it is all laid on Flarry the bomboys head, whom they have prended 4oz 8as, Nedd alledging that he took his brother out of his grave, with his gold & what other theings he had in with him, which he makeing appear before all the Cabbosheers they have ordered him to pay the above said sume, which I was forced to pay in goods before I could get either boy or slaves from their croome. The reason of the canoes so long stay is itt being their Christmas time, they would not go about till now their danceing is over. Captain Dick demands for custome at said time one green perpetuano, & eight gallons rum as all custome at a new Cheifs settling, which he says my predecessors have alwais paid him, which if so please to advise me. I hope the musketts are mended before this time, so desire you'l please to send them. You order me to buy canoes, & I do not know what goods to pay for them. I am enformed of a 11 hand canoe to be sold, & on Munday expect her here to view her. I am forced to turne away traders because I have no goods to sell them, so desire you to send up per first opportunity what sheets you have to spare, two, three & four pound pewter basons of each sort a hundred, alsoe what powder you can spare, as also the workmen for I am ready for them. I know not what I shall doe with the whitemen, they not haveing their pay can gett nothing to eat, & these people's faith extend no further than ready [money], so humble desire you'l send mony to pay them by first opportunity; also to send a doctor with medicines and salves to look after our people's leggs & other deseases. If they are not looked after they will drop off, or else must send them downe to Cabo Corso & so disable ourselves. I hope you'l be pleased to allow me some expence of lyquor, which I have expended at makeing upp the palaver. I am verry much in want of a good loke [= lock] for the warehouse, this that is on being quite spoiled, so that I am forced to putt a small padlock on, which signifies no more then if there were none. Please to take notice that Mr Jennings received on Mr Gorings accompt from Captain Billy 7a, & Braffo 6a 6ta. We shall be verry much necess[it]ated for two boyes in the makeing of the bricks, so desire you'l please to send back Quomin & another boy. If you can spare me the 8 mark pile of weights which did formerly belong to Annashan, they would be a great help to me, here not being one pile fitting to recieve or pay mony by in the fort. Please to send to me bolts & staples for windows, also as good pair of stilliards [= steelyards] to weight the brass by, these we have here being good for nothing.
PS. When you send the canoe please to order her to take in my things, being much necessitated for my lining [= linen]."
1722,3,84,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,25/07/1795,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 23d instant received, & observed the contents there of, and doe find that I am accused for extorting mony from the natives, & useing other means [ms. 'maens'] prejudiciall to the Companys concerns in this place, all which I utterly disown, and think it verry hard that you should be against that which all the Cabbosheers both of this place, Cape Tres Pointas & Butteroe thought to be to little a satisfaction for Nedds panyaring my boy, & keeping him three weaks fast nailed to a blo[c]k & almost starved, for pallavers which were long before my time. I might then well make myself a party when the affront was put on me. As for following [ms. 'fallowing'] Mr Johnsons courses, I disown them and regard my owne sefety more, not designeing to loose my life & ruin my security upon such trifle pallavers, though if occasion were (which God forbid) should as willingly loose my blood in their service as any other of the Companys servants. The ounce I am not as yet paid, neither was it given to me, but [to] the boy & slave who were sufferers. I acknowledge that I did fire att canoes in the bay, but they did not belong to this place, butt were Mine canoes, that buy up all the corne before it is fitting to take in, & we all ready to starve for want of bread, being forced for six small cankys a day to pay six angles the two months, & it cannot be expected that 285 lb beafe can last for ever. Their oyle or fowles they will not sell to us, but the Mina canoes may buy them under rate. In short, they would be rogues, if they had witt enough, & their designe [ms. 'desinge'] I believe is to starve us. I have by me twenty butts oyster shells, & wood within a small matter to burn a kill of 50000 bricks, & should have been much forwarder if these people would have given their assistance as they ought to have done. The custome in palavers you mention the Dutch use, it was also used att this place but never brought up by me, but it being your order to the contrary shall most strickly observe, & for the future, unless it concerns my masters intrest, shall on no terms whatsoever concern my self in any of their palavers, but leave them to their owne laws & customes. I had not concerned myself in this, but you ordered me to be assisting to Hucame, and he being such an old fool, they would never have done it if I had not gone, so that my goeing was in obedient to your orders. The report goes in these parts, that the Copeman of Butteroe has order to raise what force he can in these parts to oppose John Cabess & Taggee, the former of which we hear the Dutch Copeman of Commenda had wounded. As I hear further of anything of consequence shall advise you. I have not a coppy of the articles of agreement by me & to the best of my remembrance never see the originall but once, so by returne of this canoe desire a coppy, also another man in the roome of William Phillips, whom I am forced to send downe by reason of his leggs. I have paid him his six months pay."
1723,3,85,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,12/09/1795,Fort,RAC,"Yours I received. This comes to desire on accompt of the Royall African Company of Engeland, one hundred 4 lb, 3 lb, & 2 lb pewter basons to be sent as soon as business will permitt, the traders staying for them. The mony I formerly advised you Mr Jennings received from Captain Billy & Braffo he is still indepted to Mr Goring, that not being included in my receipt. You will likewise receive an accompt of what things I have of his. As for an accompt of his debts I have none, Mr Jening[s] carrying to Cabo Corso, so desire the workman of. It is likewise of the articles of aggreement for this place. I hope by this time the platforme may be done at Cabo Corso, so desire the worckmen may be sent, I haveing in readiness burnt fifty thousand bricks & upwards of fifty butts of shells which I am unwilling to burne before I see the workmen. The slaves we have most of them being lame is the reason we goe so slo[w]ly to work with the bricks, but if you please to spare me a dosen or a halfe more of slaves, I dare promise not only to build that which is downe with good brick, but [to] new case the rest of the fort, which will preserve it mightily from the rains. Here is no news stirring in these parts, nor any schips to windward. When the workmen come please to send some cordages for the scaffolds, as also Quashee the carpenter."
1724,3,86,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,18/09/1795,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 14th instant I received, with Serjeant Nathan Lathom, in whose roome according to order have sent downe Serjeant Clunn, [with whom also] Thomas Alner & Francis Nixon. The 2_ lb basons shall sell according to order. Per next pray advise the mens pay you now have sent upp, and likewise send four quarter cask tarras, a carpenter & a saw for the sawyers use, as also the nails formerly wrote for. There are severall other necessarys wanting which my indisposition hinders me from writing, but when I am better shall further advise."
1725,3,87,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,20/09/1795,Fort,RAC,"I hope you have had before now mine of the 18th past. This comes expres for three cask knives & five or six hundred brass panns, which desire you'l please to send with speed, and any other goods you have vendable, as green & red perpetuanoes not damaged, these few I have by me being damaged they will not sell so well. I hope whe [= we] shall in a short time gett this place in a posture of defence. In order thereto, your worships know building in this country cannot be carryed on without expence of lyquor, and you alone being the onely judges thereof, I humbly tender to your consideration, for our slaves being so few [we] must of necessity use the assistance of the natives, and if you please to send the other sawyer with the slaves and a carpenter, I will not trouble you for a deale board or any thing else this country affords. The surveyour desires six women slaves may be sent up, for he shall mightily stand in need of them in working about the fort and carrying lime & swish.
PS. Pray send the nails formerly wrote for, with bolts & staples for the windows, with four hundred large spikes."
1726,3,88,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,11/10/1795,Fort,RAC,"By this canoe comes the quarter cask of wine, thinking you might be in want of it have sent it downe. I should have sent it downe before but that I only waited for the great canoe. I could neither for love nor money procure you either butter or cheese, they bringing just enough for themselves. Here is another ship I hear to windward, if I can get anything out of her shall not fayle to do it. Pray, Gentlemen, if you can spare me a doctor, for I am mightily troubled with fa[i]ntings that take me clear of my leggs. I am too weake, I can scarce stand. I hear nothing of news but what you had long before now. Pray lett me have the nails & the rest of the things formerly wrote for."
1727,3,89,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,19/10/1795,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 23 September & of the 14 instant have received & observe the contents thereof, and according to order have sent my accompts & lickwise Mr Gorings remains, as you will perceive per the inclosed accompts. The sayes and bafts have received, but am afraid they will turne to no accompt at this place. The six women slaves you sent [I] desire to know their pay, as also the black bricklayer & carpenter. We have two slaves that work verry well and are verry servicable in the building, they therfore desire you would be pleased to advance them. Here is a whiteman by name John Ashfield whom the surveyor does approve of, if you think it convenient he desires he may have the allowance and work at the trade. You will find by my accompts the expence that I have been at for building & getting things in readiness, so humbly desire you'l pl[e]ase to allow it, I haveing come as near my expence as may be. The surveyor can informe you what trouble I am att. The latter rains have been verry excessive and has thrown downe another of our bastians [= bastions], so that we have no defence against any thing that may happen, but nothing shall be wanting in me towards the forwarting [= forwarding] of it. According to your order have examined the whitemen about the mony they are indepted to Mr Goring. Edward Howell acknowledges 6_a & John Ashfield 5a, w[h]ich is all they will owne. Sirs, please to take notice that Mr Jennings is indepted to me loz for twelve Guiney clouts he paid the slaves with and 2a for an anchor of brandy, which I desire may be paid. I am verry sorry you have never a doctor to send us & that we must [be] beholding to our neighbours the Dutch, whose assistance we cannot get without we pay dear for it, I being forced to give the Dutch doctor half an ounce for bleeding the surveyor, he being almost dead with the plurisie [= pleurisy]. I desire the liberty of come[ing] downe to Cabo Corso to see if change of air will do any good. I am upon recovery, but every now & then troubled still with those fainting fitts. The rum have received, but do not know what quantity that contains. Hopeing you'l grant my request.
PS. We must be forced to lye still till the surveyor returns againe. Please to take the ballance of my accompts and pass it to Mr Gorings, & please to returne my receipt."
1728,3,90,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,29/10/1795,Fort,RAC,"Haveing this opportunity of a canoe to Cabo Corsoe thought fitt to advise you of affairs of these parts. These people, upon what accompt I know not, on the 28 of this instant denied us water & were all up in arms, soe that thought they would have fight us. They take the opportunity off the fort being down & knowing that a slit deale door is all our protection. Dick, to whome you have been toe [= too] civill, more then he ever deserved, is the chieff fomenter of all this buisness. I thought it my duty to advise you of these things since they soe near relate to my masters intrest. Gentlemen, he is a verry foothish [= foolish] fellow & is let [= led] on by the nose by a parcell of rouges, who because they are indepted to Mr Goreing would be allways in pallavers, to keep them out of reach of paying of it. I suppose they being most of them for the Dutch, they [= the Dutch] may sett them to worke. I desire if you thinck it convenient now wee lie in soe ticklish a condition we may have Cabo Corsoe souldiers, that they may assist us in times when we shall have occasion. Wee cannot goe forward with the building because want a carpenter to fix the gurders [= girders] of our flankers, & I doe not question but that we may goe on verry well. We have need, Gentlemen, of a Captain for this place that can keep it[s] people under, & not such [ms. 'sach'] a one as Captain Dickey, whoe instead of commanding is commanded by everyone, & if you please to chuse one then we shall have what we want for building ready to our hands. I could not gett anything done when the workmen first came up till Captain Dickey had a quarter cask of rume, & now he has had it is all one, nothing can be done by faire means, & if I should goe to seek compulsion you would lay the blame on me and say I have broake the articles of agreement & that alone am the hinderance of the building, soe that refer to your judgement."
1729,3,91,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,06/11/1795,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 31st October have received, & observe the contents therein. This you'l receive by Captain Huccamee. The palaver I had made up two days before he came, for a green perpetuano which they demanded, thinking it better to comply with them at this time, the Castle being downe about our ears two or three nights before this palaver happened. If Captain Billy would have been as great a rogue as Dickey they where to have come up and fight us, and because the other would not come, Dick would have come himself with what men he could have raised of his kindred, but none of them through Captain Billys perswasions be[ing] willing to come, he was forced to give over the attempt. Gentlemen, there being a Dutch interloper to windward who by the later end of this month will be ready to goe off, desire that youl please to give me liberty to come to Cabo Corso to clear all accompts, that I may take my passage home in him for Europe, you being very [ms. 'every'] sensible I have not injoyed my health since I have been in the country. So waiting your answer & hopeing you'l grant my request."
1730,3,92,Nathan Lathom,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,13/11/1795,Fort,RAC,"My master being verry bad, I made bold to write unto you to sati[s]ff[i]e that the reason of the cournew [= canoe] staying so long was because he was not able to writt, and desires you will be pleased to send a doctor, for he has had a violent f[e]avour this five or six dayes and without spedy remedy we fear he will dye, and for the other two men that was sick on[e] is recovere[d] and [t]he other is so bad he is not able to come down in the cornieuw.
PS. My master would desire you to spare Doctor Jackson up for one weak if you can conveniently."
1731,3,93,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,23/11/1795,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 9th instant I received, but was then in [ms. 'a'] such a condition that I was not able to answer it, neither am I much better now, for I am afraid I shall loose the use of my left [ms. 'lest'] hand and all that side of my body. The occasion of my now writing I have a Portuguez come ashoare, if you thinck it convenient to entertaine him. He came on shoare the 20th instant. Here is nothing of newes stirring in these parts, nor no ships to windward.
PS. Please to send Bastian and the other saweyor [= sawyer], because we are now forced to stay for them, as also a saw."
1732,3,94,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,29/11/1795,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 25 instant I received, & the Portugueeze has contracted for three years, soe have entertained him accordingly. William Seffton departed this life yesterday. He made me his executor, by next you shall receive the coppy. I have gott one flanker up & paved itt. Desire soome scaffolding ropes by first opportunity."
1733,3,95,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,13/12/1795,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 9th instant have received, with Bastian & the sawyer, as also the saw. I shall not faile to keep [t]hem to worck as much as I can. Two or three nights agoe a party of the Adoomes, soomes of Jappo's friends & Ante Sherry['s] own cousin sett upon him [= Ante Sherry] & routed him, he narrowly escapeing with one of his wifes & a little girle."
1734,3,96,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,01/12/1795,Fort,RAC,"This day arrived in this road Capt. Osburne, an English interloper from England. I hear of no more shipping from Europe, my friends adviseing me that there will be no ships from the Company these two months yett."
1735,3,97,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,21/12/1795,Fort,RAC,"Yours with the iron worck &a I received, [omission] [ad]vise you of w[h]at news was stirring, but for the future shall be more large. Capt. Buttram & Capt. Pepperell are arrived safe. & Capt. Piles is supposed to be taken. The Hanniball is also arrived safe. Capt. Buttram & Peperell are both a comeing out againe. The files advised of we are in great need off, our saw being soe blunt that they can scarce saw with them. We haved sawed out soome boards of sixteen inshes broad, & haith we these files should goe verry forwardly on. soe deseiring the files by first opportunity, I wish you a merry Christmas & a happy new year."
1736,3,98,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,22/12/1795,Fort,RAC,"This serves only as a cover to the inclosed. Noting he being a privateer watering at Cape Tres Pointas, the Dutch galley commanded her aboard as firing att her. They being unwilling to broak the pease, the Captain went on board with his commission, which they have cavilled at & doe designe to make her a price [= prize]. If they doe these things in the sea the next thing will be to take the fort, not privatly as they did Succondee, but openly. At noon day they desire to know your mind weither [= whether] they shall follow the galley into Mina. They are not willing to breake the peace, but they say than can soon take the Dutchman.
PS. They desire [you] to send a canoe to advice them if they shall come to Cabo Corso. They have eighty men in the ship, the Commander Capt. Robert Glover of the Resolution, privet man of ware, belonging to Antago [= Antego], the owners Capt. Perry & Capt. Home of Antago, & have been out of New York in New England seven weekes."
1737,3,99,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,26/12/1795,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 24th instant I received with the letter there inclosed, which shall deliver. When any such thing [as] that if any Company ship should be to windward, I should be soe negligent as not to give timely advise of them. This serves on purpose to advise you of the disorder that happined yesterday in the towne. These people have fallen upon some Dankary traders that are there waiting for goods, & have beat them & have taken some of their money from them, which hath soe exasperacted them because Captain Dick would not redress them that one of the Chief of them hath stuck of knife in his throat & hath certainly cutt it, if I had not timely sent the Serjeant down, who upon promise of you[r] protection hath disisted. I sent for Captain Dick, whoe lies in such a condition that a[t] present I am forced to hold a candell to the devill. Where [= were] the fort up should not trouble you with these palaver. The surveyor desires that William Coubourne may measure the wid[e]ness of the cooke roome & he'll gett the timber accordingly. Please to send the two files formerly wrote for."
1738,3,100,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,21/01/1796,Fort,RAC,"This serves only to advise you of the departure of the Generall of the Brandenburgs, who went away this morning. As soon as had advise of the interloper I sent on board (which was on the 20 instant), he said he was verry sorry that he could not stay to take in your packett. There is a little to windward [of] Axim an New England interloper, all the provisions he has to sell is butter & flower. There is also a Lisbon Portuguese loaded with French brandy & wine. Noe other ships to windward. Sirs, our whiteman being greatly in want of mony & being ready to starve, desire youl be pleased to send them their pay for the laste two months, here being no goods vendable, I have launsed [= launched] out all the mony in that I have in Castle charges, soe that unless I can have some mony or vendable goods I shall not be able for the future to send downe a cano to advise you any thing that may happen. We are greatly in want of files formerly wrote for. The axle trees are ready when you please to send for them."
1739,3,101,Bastian Ferdinand,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,21/01/1796,Fort,RAC,"I hope you will be please to give me the same pay I formerly had, which was ten angles one month, for the worck leys [= lies] verry hard upon me and my pay is but small, and if your Worships pleases to grant me it I shall be verry willing to doe any thing I can in the country, or else I think to goe home to my own country."
1740,3,102,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,05/02/1796,Fort,RAC,"This you will receive by Richard Richardson, who is very desirous to goe home in the Fauconberg. I beg your pardon for sending him downe, but he informed me it was your orders. Sirs, I humbly begg the favour of you, since my intentions are for Europe, that you'l be pleased to send some body up to take the charge of this place and that I may come downe in time before the ship goes for Cabo Corso, and not be hurried away just as the ship is goeing. Here is no news stiring in these parts save that the Mine canoes lies up and downe Takaradoe & Aquba. Here is just now come into this road Capt. Johnson, a Dutch interloper, who is bound for Holland. The fort is now in a posture of defence, only the thatch that is over the hall will somthing annoy us, if wee should happen to come to a fight, but I doe not fear any such thing unless it be from Mine people, the Cabbasheers promising me that they will stand by this place with their lives and fortune. The Serjeant in his passage to Cabo Corso when he came off of Commenda was forced to returne back, the canoe men being afraid to venture. Anta Shrevy is at Axim getting an army, but not haveing money enough I beleive will come to nothing."
1741,3,103,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,21/02/1796,Fort,RAC,"Yours I received, & by the bearer have sent the remainder of the goods I panyard. Some are sold, of which I shall give you an accompt when I come to Cabo Corso. Seeing I can have no justice from your hands, shall add no more.

1742,3,104,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,24/02/1796,Fort,RAC,"This you'l receive by Henry Casey, who comes downe in a Portuguze, to secure him from being seized by the Dutch, he being as he informes consigned for Cabo Corso. I once more desire that you'l please to send another to supply my place, & that I may come downe to Cabo Corso before the ship goes, for I suppose itt can'tt be very long now before she does goe, & besides, wee have no money nor goods to sell for any, that wee are ready to starve, the faith of these people extending no further then ready money. Edward Howell departed this life this instant, and what he had hath left by will to John Davis. There is to windward a St Thoma Portuguze & a French man of war."
1743,3,105,John Pink,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,07/03/1796,Fort,RAC,"This you'l receive by the hand of a Portuguze, who was seized upon by Captain Dick, belonging to Capt. Lawrence Schoza. After they took all he had, with much intreaty I gott him from them & accordingly have sent him downe, & Sirs, humbly beg that you'l please to send another in my roome, I being very sencible that it now cannot be long before the ship departs Cabo Corso, & for me to be sent away in a hurry will be much to my cost, soe hoping you'l be favourable as to grant my request.

1744,3,106,Thomas Buckeridge,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,12/03/1796,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys Mr John Pinck, from whom have received the Royal Companys fort and factory, att the [= this] place, with the merchandize, stores &c therein contained, as per inclosed inventoryes, the condition of which is none of the best, our walls being raised with swish, daily crack and settle, and notwithstanding some of them are thinly cased and covered with bricks, and what quantity of lime can allow, upon great storms of raine the ground through excess of moisture yeilding to the foundation reduces them under such circumstances as the other, that unless after every shower they are new tarrased and securd the water has free passage into them and occasions them to fall, so that fear unless such a quantity of shells can be procured as may raise itt with good stuff, it will never be finished. It is them [i.e. shells] I want, and shall endeavour to gett if possible, more whereof shall advise per next. What goods I found in the warehouse were extreamly damaged, as you may perceive. The blanketts very rotten and some of them full of maggotts, [I] gave to the slaves, being asham'd to see them among other goods. The sayes being 10 in number, I know not what to doe with, being soe damaged, also some other goods not much better. Here are in the country some Danckra traders, which have been with mee for perpetuanoes, sheets and basons, the latter whereof and some carpetts have sold. I received your letter of the 9th instant with things mentioned att the foot thereof, and want for the surveyor 12 slitt deales, 4 small gimblett, and 1 adds [= adze], I notice you[r] pleasure concerning the timber, which is not yett ready, but will [be] before an opportunity of sending it. I desire you supply me with goods, arms (what I have here being good for nothing), also swords for the men, cartridg[e] paper, the Gunner haveing none left, 2 small ladels and wormes, a sheep skin, some scuper nailes. 40 of my granadoes want new fuses. I hear nothing of Shrevy or shiping. I find the blacks somthing more insolent more then they use to bee. One of the canoe men belonging to Dickies Cove which brought mee up hither, Mr Pinck putting in irons, telling me he was his slave, I am forc't to keep him in the fort, untill I know your pleasure, to gratifie the black[s], who have made great complaint thereon, saying he was pawnd to Mr Pinck for payment of 14a which he had in goods and brandy, for to satisfie the Cabbasheers for making a pallavera which he had att that time, & that 8a thereof are to be discounted upon his going 8 times to Cabo Corso, so that there are but 6 remaining, which they offer to pay. Mr Pinck charges him with 8a more, which he paid att Succondee, haveing one of his canoes panyard there upon this fellow[s] head for stealing a knife. Sirs, pray forgett not the great canoe, with which desire may be sent my beding, brandy and hampar [= hamper] of wine, if she may come with safety.
PS. I shall want some paper, haveing none here. Please by the Dickies Cove canoe to send my firkin of butter, 6 cakes of soap, and what more she will hold and may be hazarded. I desire some wax wafers, haveing none is occasion of my not sealing here."
1745,3,107,Thomas Buckeridge,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,24/03/1796,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 13th instant with the necessaries at the foot thereof have received, also 10 new muskitts (5 old ones being wholly unserviceable are herewith returned), and what last wrote for, 12 slitt dales, 4 small gimbletts, with threed and needles more for the surveyor, 1000 ten peny nailes, 3 plaines and plaine irons, a fore plaine, a jack plaine, a joynter, a broad axe, a gudge [= gouge] and a firmer. The ladles you sent are to large for our gunns, and for the fuses (our Gunner not knowing how to fitt and fix them) am little the better. I shall endeavour to put of the damnified goods, to what advantage am able, & must desire you to putt a small price upon the sayes, which otherwise, being no commodity in this countrey, will lie untill they are worth nothing. I believe att 12a each may in a short time dispose of them. The chest of beads can also sell but not att six taccoes per pound, wherefore if you will suffer me to vend at a lesser rate I doubt not to make a considerable sayle thereof. What I wrote in my last concerning the fort was what I experienced when here before, and have great cause still to feare, the walls which tumbled being built of the same or little better stuff. The surveyor according to my judgement hath done and daily uses his endeavour, which without materialls can but little availe. Both he and I hope they will not fall againe, and keep our slaves continually att work in getting shell between this and Butteroe, from whence think wee may procure 40 or 50 butts, which shall be sure [to] use to what advantage wee can. I am told their are great quantity of shells about 6 leagues to leward which may more then finish our work and that Mr Pinck hath payed for them, but unless I have a great canoe and halfe a dozen small ones for bringing them hither, shall reap little benefitt of them, the people here being unwilling to goe without extrodinary payment, and then but when they please, not halfe loading their canoes, but if you please to send me such from Cabo Corso or allow me to purchase the latter here for Companys accompt, I have canoe men belonging to me to padle them, who shall wholly imploy in fetching thereof, whereby doubt not in a little time and without much charge to procure lime enough for our building, if some new pallavar of the negroes does not interveen. The timber for the cook roome, 4 planckes for gunn carridges and peices for axle trees, lyes ready for sending. Captain Dickie and Cabbasheers demand their Chistmas dashees according to contract made with me formerly, which Mr Pinck hath not payed. The former desireth his cloth to be blue, which if you please to send me one or two more for such Cabbesseers as may be servisable it will not be amiss. What the Cabbasheers are to have at Christmas and at their dancing time in June, be pleased to advise. The coppy of their contract being not with mee, have forgott. Here are abundance of Dankra traders continually baiteing me for goods, who would not lett me rest untill I promised to write for some, which if they come safe, could heartily wish were supplyed with, as well to defray factory charges as to satisfie the tradders, from whom have bought four cows, which if you please to have shall send downe by first opportunity. I believe this will prove a place of great trade and in some time will fully repay the Companys charg[e] of building with interest, if new warrs do not brake forth. I here the Taggees have fought, upon which have various reports, wherefore hope it may be for the Companeys interest. I lost in comeing Mr Mellross note of debts, which desire to have a coppy of per next, also some flints, haveing none that are good in the fort, with corkers [= caulkers] tools for the surveyor. Asherrey hath lately been at Succondee panyaring his brother Mensa's women, and is now within two miles of us at a Cabbasheers croome named Conconoco with some force, pretending he is going to Axhim. I have bought some snappans [= snaphances], which designe to keep in the fort for use thereof, that if any disturbance should happen the Companys blacks and others belonging to mee may be armed for our defence, the muskitts I have not being sufficient for halfe our people neither so ready as the former, wherefore desire they may be allowed in my first accompt.
PS. I am in great want of a small vise [= vice] for cleaning our arms. Please to send some swords and bandileers.

1746,3,108,William Puplett,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,02/04/1697,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 27 ultimo with two marks gold yesterday received, and the same day came a man into the bushes near the Castle who sent to know your answer, to whom I returned answer according to your orders, who immediately replyed that nothing lesse then their former demands should end the pallaver, and that your slaves must no more go into the woods, till such time you send their soldiers three bendys, which money they have been very urgent for, the Dankara traders being very desirous to come and trade but are prevented for want of the said soldiers money, and if that was paid I should have a free passage into the wood, and presume a good trade. The Cabbasheers here want to goe for Cabo Corso againe, seeing they have no pallaver to make. Wee have burnt one kiln of lime, and thatcht the hall, and now most of the slaves must stand still, they not being suffered to goe into the woods, which with the continuall raines wee have and have had (ere [= ever] since the surveyor arrived) shall proceed very slowly toward repaireing the Fort. What the canoamen informed your worships is notorious false and forged lies, to excuse themselves for running away. Inclosed is the accompt of charges for last three months, the ballance of which desire may have sent by first shipp. The two shovells sent was stop'd att Comenda, soe desire two more. The nailes and axe are received.
As for the 14 perpetuanoes trusted the Addoomes, I did it judgeing it would have proved for the Royal Companeys interest, and [as] for not adviseing thereof, could not gett a canoa to goe for Cabo Corso, and they [= the Adorns] pretended hast[e] for their more expedition comeing back into the countrey, but if I must see it paid (which is very hard upon me) I desire I may have the five men and boys sent me by first shipp, that I may make what money I can of them towards paying myself. The two lusty women and Anthony are the two I found here at Mr Phillips death, the latter was pawned to Dickie and the former was sent (as the Serjeant informed me) for protection and not for pawnes, Mr Phillips not takeing one pawne the time of his being here. The daminner his wife and a lusty young man are pawnes for the powder and barrs that I trusted the Addoomes, the five which I took for the perpetuanoes are Atoo, Coffe, the man that is sick, the boy that has a gold feitich about his neck, and the tall young man. The other a little boy I kept for better satisfaction of the other five. I humbly desire the 3 pawnes of Dickies to be returned me when the shipp comes, except Dickie will send the money, which is 4oz 4a 6ta, Mr Pinson can satisfie you which, and the fiv[e] pawned for the perpetuanoes. Two of our townes people are panyard in the bushes and will not be delivered till the pallaver is made up. I doe not perceive but the longer the pallaver is deferred, the more inflexable the Antas are, soe desire a speedy answer.
PS. I have a very hard swelling in my belly and stopage in my stomach, that I cannot fetch my breath without great paine, which makes almost incapable of any bussiness.
Just now King Badue sent to me to know your answer, and also was very urgent for the souldiers money, saying he had given pawnes for it. I presume if the money was paid would be a great insight to me, to see their reallity of performing their promises, and should know how far they deserve more."
1747,3,109,William Puplett,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,06/04/1697,Fort,RAC,"This serves to desire some person to take charge of this factory, my indisposition since my last being increased, with a fevor which makes me wholly uncapable of any business, not being able to stir out of my bed, or to speake to anyone without



a great deal of paine, and but little hopes of long continuance in this world, therefore desire a speedy answer with your orders to come for Cabo Corso."
1748,3,110,Henry Vincent,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,15/04/1697,Fort,RAC,"This comes by Mr Pupplett, with whom have inventoryed this warehouse and factory, and to whom I refere you to receive an accompt of affaires in these parts, desireing your needfull instructions accordingly. I desire youl please to send a cask of beefe, here being great scarcity of provitions, [and] some money to defray the charges of this Factory, here being no trade so can receive none."
1749,3,111,Henry Vincent,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,27/04/1697,Fort,RAC,"Since the departure of Mr Pupplett from this place I have been mightily importuned by the blacks to make up this pallaver, and [blank] I sent to Captain Billy, who came to me and expresses a great desire of peace, that he may come and live in the town, which he and all his people would so soon as the pallaver is ended. I also sent to King Badue, but he would not come, but sent me word he and his people would come and build the towne and live here if the pallaver was ended. All they demand is three bendys eighteen angles for the soldiers in the countrey to make them lay downe their armes, and some liquor to drink, but without will not make any pallaver. I hear King Badue gave some pawnes to the countrey people to keep them quiett till the pallaver was over, and that they have brought him his pawnes againe, soe last Munday they panjard 4 of our townes women, and our townes people went out after them, but could not overtake them. The two Cabbasheers you sent were very impatient for one of them to goe to you, soe have sent one in the canoa. Please to send us three or four thousand bricks for the steps, and some odd things. As yett cannot begin the flanker because cannot send into the woods for timber. There is no shipp at Cape Tres Pointas, but as soon as hear of any shall advise.
PS. Here is no scales, blowpanes nor sifters, when any occasion offers, soe desire you'l please to send some, as also some cartridge paper and some come, here being but little to supply the slaves as well as ourselves."
1750,3,112,Henry Vincent,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,04/05/1697,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 21 & 22d ultimo have received, and sent immediately to Ainam, King Badue and Billy, the last of whom came but the others would not, returning answer that my predicessors had sent them such word as I, but they could neversee anything, soe would have the goods sent to them, which I refused to doe, but sent King Badue and the others word that if they would send me some pawnes [I] would send them some part of the goods, but they refused, soe [I] took two pawnes of an old Cabbasheer that lives in the towne and sent them 3 perpetuanoes, upon which on Saturday last King Badue and Billy came on to the sand but would not come to the Castle, soe I went to them and at last gott them to take a feit[i]ch to be true to the English and to keep any body from coming to molest them in getting of wood, or in trade or any way whatsoever, but on the contrary to help them in the aforesaid things, as also against anybody that should oppose them, and they made me take a feitich to protect them, which ended [the matter], I gave them the goods to the value of 3 bendyes, but their greatest pallaver was for 10 bendeyes more for the Cabbasheers, this being for the soldiers to lay by their armes, which they say Capt. Pepperell promised them at a pallaver with them, to which I answered I knew nothing of that nor had no orders for any such thing but would give them the 3 bendys, which at last they took, but put into my feitich that I would write to you and send them a true answer of what you wrote, with the full quantity of what you allowed them if any thing, but I did not know whether you would give them any thing or not. Captain Ainam did not come, but King Badue told me he would come and take a feitich if you would deliver up his cozen you have at Cabo Corso, but hope the paire will be as well. Captain Billy haveing begun to build in the towne, and he and King Badue are the Chief Cabbasheers in these parts, but they are much against Captain Dickie, and they will not have him to come here any more, if he should [it] would breed fresh troubles. This day have sent into the woods to gett what wood we can to burne shells. Mr Howard tells me there is timber enough downe to last the sawyers this month, soe please to send them, for we cannot remove nor doe any thing with it till they come. The Brandenburgh ship is come to Cape Tres Pointas from tradeing to windward, they saw no ship besides the Barbadoes man. I have herewith sent you the petitition of John Davis, he being one that was here at the fight the blacks doe not effect [= aifect] him. If you send for him please to send us somebody in his roome. I have also sent the Cabbasheers by this canoa.
PS. Please to send us 3 or 4 paire bandeleers or catuch [= cartouche] boxes and a screw to draw a muskett. As to other necessaryes referr you to the surveyors note and my last letter.
Pray send some writing paper by the canoa, for I have no more than what I herewith send you."
1751,3,113,Henry Vincent,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,15/05/1697,Fort,RAC,"I received yours of the sixth instant on Sunday last, at which time was violently ill of a feavour and have been soe almost ever since, but now thank God am a little better, if it hold. Capt. Piles sailed from hence with the slaves as you ordered on Munday night last to Cape Tres Pointas, where he now is. He desired [sic: = delivered] one cask of beef here, and (as the Serjeant informs me, who measured it, I being sick) eighty one chests come, leaveing some with Mr Gore at Commenda. The come is very indefferent, and wonder any body should enforme your Honours of such a falsity of selling any come here, there is no such thing, nor I had never any body come to aske to buy come, only Dickies cozen a chest when I came here first, but I do not perceive the countrey people doe want come, and here it will lie and spoyle, for I have nowhere to keep it but on a moist floor, and the drying it will keep halfe our slaves alwayes in employ. I only writte for a little for our own and slaves use. Please to send some nicconees and sheets, those being the goods the blacks ask for. When the sawyer comes from Cape Tres Pointas shall observe your orders in cutting out the timber. The Doctor has sent a note of mediccines he wants, please to lett him have what can be spared, for he has none, and know not how soon I may be sick againe, it only being removed with the Jesuitt barke, soe desire you'l please to dispatch the canoa againe with all speed. I do not hear of any shipps to windward, but when that or anything else offers you may be sure of advice.
PS. Pray send me some writeing paper by the canoa, as also scailes, waites [= weights], blow pane & other necessaryes I have before wrote for. They gott all the things our surveyor wrote for at Comenda, desire some more."
1752,3,114,Henry Vincent,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,04/06/1697,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 18 and 24 last past I have received, with the three barrells of powder on accompt of the Royall African Company of England. I am sorry for the mischance the other canoa mett with at Comenda. I have observed your orders and sent Howard, slaves and corn to Cape Tres Pointas the same day the canoa came. As to the natives I cannot see but they are wholly reconciled to the English, for since my last Captain Ainam has been here, and took a feitich to be true to the English, but would not come to the Castle till his cozen at Cabo Corso be delivered to him, the which he made me promise to write to you and send him your answer. However he took a feitich not to hinder us any way, nor panyar our people (which he remaines firm to), so that now no body molests us. Here was lately the Dutch Generalls boy came to make a pallaver with the Antas, his business was to gett them to fight Great Taggee, and offered them money (how much I know not), but they refused all offers, and sent me word of itt next day by my boy, who was there, which refusall I encouraged them in, and reminded them of their feitiches, and now they seem very true, soe hope all will continue well. As to the measure of the corne, I advised you before [I] was sick when it came, and left the measureing to the Serjeant, soe when the slaves returne from Cape Tres Pointas, shall measure it, and advise you of. I have nothing to advise of any shipping but those that are past by and hope safe with you, which would have done sooner but want canoas, soe hope you will please to order two up.
PS. Pray send me some paper, the last you send being lost at Commenda, as also the ironwork. As to the necessaryes have sent you the Gunners note."
1753,3,115,Thomas Howard,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,02/07/1697,Fort,RAC,"I doe herein give your worships an accompt of what materialls is wanting here: four iron barrs, 4 foot long apeice flatt, and [with] mortaces [= mortises] to lett in the 4 asses with shoulders to them, which wee have occation for one of our flankers, three stone hammers, six bills, two paire of linepins and one broad ax[e]. Worthy Sirs, I humbly desire you would be pleased to send me one white man to assist me, either carpenter or bricklayer, one to look after the bricklayers, or the other to goe in the woods, to look affter them, for I cannott look affter them all my selfe and they are so lazy I cannott make them work. Worthy Sirs, the things wrote for before have received, a two hand saw from on board Capt. Piles, and a grindstone and two old shovells that were broak to peices in makeing the sawpitts att Cape Tres Punctus. Worthy Sirs, I understand he had another saw and two axes for us, which he carryed away with him again. Worthy Sirs, I desire your worshipps to send 3 iron shovells more, and a pair of hand screws to gett our timber on the pitt, for itt is so larg[e] thatt wee cannott doe without. Likewise some ropes with all to draw our timber out of the countryes. Worthy Sirs, I desire your worshipps would be pleased to send people to make bricks, and I doe not q[u]estion but in two or three months time, if itt please God, I shall bring Dickes Cove in good repair."
1754,3,116,Henry Vincent,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,03/07/1697,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 10th ultimo have received, since which Ainim has sent to me about his cozen, and I returned him the same answer you sent me, with which he seemes to be well sattisfyed, and has sent me word [he] will come to the Castle. The Antas have been mightily of late affraid of the Adoomes comeing, but now hear nothing of itt, Captain Anta, one that was with the Adomes, being come to make fri[e]nds with Ainim. If [they] should come Ainim would find but few to helpe him, for Billy nor Baddue I hear will not, and the Brandenburgs have putt all the Cabbosheers att Accadah in irons for agreeing to take Ainims money. At present are all things very peaceable.
Since Capt. Pepperrell went down have received a letter from the Branderborgs Generall, he wanted two of his slaves. One was here which I sent him, the other I hear went downe in the said Captains shipp. Please to order him to be looked for and sent, he is brother to one Hennicoe, a cozen to Aggubah Braffoe.
I desire you will please to send me these following goods, having been much inquired for (vizt) two chests sheets, and some nickones and brass panns, with one cask two pound and one ditto one pound pewter basons. This cask that have here upon opening find to be four pound basons.
In yours of the 10th ultimo, you were pleased to mention [I] must make the come received as in your last. The come I have measured since, and find itt to be no more than whatt before writt you, and have tryed the chest by severall others, in which is noe default. If Capt. Piles had one hundred sent on board [he] would have done well to have seen the delivery of them, for the Serjeant will avouch there was but 81 brought here, therefore with submission to your honours think itt not reasonable to charg[e] 11 chests att 3a each more than have received, so desire you will please to consider of itt.
PS. I forgott in my last so thought fitt to advise here that when Ainim took his fettish I gave them the six yards cloath you alowed. Pray send me some writeing paper, for have received none. As to other necessaryes for the building, refer you to the surveyors letter."
1755,3,117,Henry Vincent,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,14/07/1697,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 8th instant have received, and shall endeavour according to our orders to keep all quiet here as wee are at present, but our Cabbosheers here have been a little disatisfied since the returne of this last canoe, by hearing all their pawnes are lately put in irons at Cabo Corso, for what reason they know not, and have been to aske of me, which I could not resolve them, so would have me write to you, that might give them an accompt. Pray send the goods, a carpenter and iron work as soon as possible can, for at present lye very open and cannot proceed for want. You herewith have our Sergeant, who haveing some buisness at Cabo Corso Castle, with your promiss to his uncle, have gave leave to goe downe in this canoe, per whome when returnes desire you will please to send money to pay our people, they being very desirous to be paid, it now being 4 months since. Here will be wanting besides what I have received two marks.
PS. I desire when you send the goods above you will send the rumm, that which had beein[g] expended at palavers and belliaring."
1756,3,118,Henry Vincent,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,05/08/1697,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 21st and 31st last past are come to my hands, and note their contents. As yett have not spoke to the Cabbosheers, some of them being buisey in rowsawing in the country, when return shall give you an accompt. The cause of this [is] the bearer, who is so troubled with a distemper in his side that he is incapable of duty, so on his request sent him down to Cabo Corso Castle, his name is Anthony Caravelo, a Po[r]tugueze. I hear Shumaw people and the Addoms are prepareing to fight Great Taggee. There is a Dutch interloper at Cape Tres Pointas under Deans [= Danes] collors, who says there is a great talk of peace in Europe, but the King is in Flanders, & the King of Sweden is dead. I have not anything more materiall but only to desire you will please to hasten the sloop with those things wrote for, with an addition of one bale peipetuanoes & 1 cask of knives.
PS. Pray when send up the sloop send somebody to releive John Davis, who is very desirous to be gone."

Captain Ainam has lately been impatient for the comeing of [his] brother, and desired me when sent to lett a man goe with him to his brother and to speak to your Honours, so desire to know your pleasure. On the 19th instant our surveyor said would go to Cabo Corso Castle, which I did not deny him, seeing him very earnest to goe, but whatt accompt I know not but suppose the cause was liquor, so desire your Honours to send him or some other, with a carpenter and necessaryes before wrote for to finish the fort, which now lies in no good condition. I have heard from the Generall of Munfort about the slave, and he says he has spoke to the Negroe whose slave he is, who will by no means allow of his slaves being detained from him unless his freinds will pay him five ounces gold, which if they will may keep him, elce if not sent they will seek satisfaction some other way, so please to send him or money by first opportunity, the Generall being very kind on all occasions and given me an invitation to see him, for which shall waite your approbation. I have several times wrote to your Honours for goods, which you have been pleased to write you will send, which pray do with all speed, I haveing sent one into the Dancres country, who is now returned with traders to King Badue['s] croome waiting for England goods, soe if not speedily sent I beleve will be gone.
PS. I desire you will send me twoe bale perpetuanoes, haveing wrote before for but one.

1758,3,120,Henry Vincent,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,06/12/1697,Fort,RAC,"This serves to acquaint your Honours that yesterday passed by this place Jacob De Brayne [= Bruyne] commander, who sayes there is a peace concluded between English, Holland and all the Confedirates ex[c]ept the Elector of Brandenberge and the Swishes, for them there is six weeks time for the English and Dutch to meditate [= mediate] between them. He saw no shipp towindward, except the Deane which is past by. Wee have now gott up the two flankers and worked up all our shells, so cannot proceed in the building without you will please to order some up, and a carpenter and a halfe round file to set the saw to cut timber for the hall. Our surveyor sayes, if had the necessaryes above would finish the fort in less then two months time, so hope you will incourage it. If had any green Welch plains could dispose to the vallue of a mark, as also some blanketts."
1759,3,121,Henry Vincent,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,28/01/1698,Fort,RAC,"This serves to inclose the letter from the Royall Affrican Company to your Honours brought by Capt. Cotterrell, who is a permissioned shipp, and one from him, who is now here wooding and watering, and expects to be down at Cabo Corso in six or eight dayes. He advises of a shipp that will be here shortly, the Commanders name is Capt. Burrows, which is all the Companyes can hear will be here soone, but advises they had taken up six more for these parts and four for the Norward, and there is a great many other English vessells coming out to supply the Spanish West Indies with slaves. Of late I have a feavour but now wee are all verry well. I have entered the Portuguezes into the Companyes service from the 31st December 1697 at loz 9t the two months, their names are Anthony Goonsolous and Antony Pararo, which hope you will please to note, as also Emannell Farnandoe, of whome have formerly advised."

My orders are to pay one ounce eight taccoes the two months."

May it please your worships I have been at the charge of canoe hire twice, for bringing up of iron worke, which I hope your Worships will please to consider me somthing for it, for the Cheife will not allow me any thing towards it. Likewise there was a file and carpenter to cutt the teeth of the saw, which stood me in two angles.

Humbly desireing your Worships would be pleased to send the iron worke by returne of this canoe, by reason there is none that's fitt for the slaves to work with."
1762,3,124,Henry Vincent,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,23/03/1698,Fort,RAC,"In answer to yours of the 16th instant, have sent my accompt to the ultimo December, and the rest to the ultimo Febbruary shall foollow in the Gally, and the remainder for the future shall follow monthly, but for the vending my goods here at present is not to be thought on, the country people are all at warrs one with another, which stopps the passages. When any thing offers for the Royall Company shall be sure to advise. At present wee have no quarrell with them, but on the contrary all our fri[e]nds, tho' know not how soone [they] may come to disturbe our Blacks in this towne, whome I hope your Honours will please to protect if [they] come, it being Billy and his people who was the first promoters of a conferance with the Blacks.

1763,3,125,Henry Vincent,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,29/03/1698,Fort,RAC,"Since my last of the 23d instant, the sloope is arived with one white and two Black sawers. According to your orders have loaded her with wood, and taken out her shells, which wee hope will finish the fort. They sawers are beginning to work, who shall take care to forward as much as I can. Wee have no signe of vending any goods here, the people in the country being still in troubles, tho' hope shortly will all be quietted, the Generall of the Brandenberghs being dead, who was a great promoter of them. I have herewith sent you one of the Ardah women slaves with her child, her name is Yaw, who breeds a great disturbance amongst the rest of the slaves, being always fighting about her, soe desire you will please to send Bristow the sawers wife in her roome.

1764,3,126,Henry Vincent,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,14/04/1698,Fort,RAC,"Yours I received, and have dispatched your letter on board Capt. Rawlin[g]s at Cape Trees Punctus, who is since sailed. Have received the lead, gunns and crowes &ca. According to your orders have inventored the factory together with Mr Gerrard Gore, and he has the ballance with him, as also accompts to the date of the inventory. I desire you would be pleased to send here two bailes of perpetuanoes, as also powder and rumme, the stock here being very low. In short time hope may have occasion to write for more goods, but at present vend nothing. You were not pleased to mention the receipt of the slave I sent, in your last, soe desire will in your next.

barrell in each, and have sent certificates accordingly.

Have entered a souldier for the Royall Company, his name is John Johnson, he made his escape from Capt. Hall, who is passed by. As for other shipping have heard of none for the Coast, only his companion, as one Bristow [= Bristol] man, but he advised two Companyes shipps are gone for Sherbrow and those parts.

They panyarred him att Pompony with two more slaves, who they keep, demanding a bendy for them. Shall see to gett them if possible, but thinking he can tell more then I can learne in the space of time, have sent him with this.

Worthy Sirs, have herewith sent
your Worshipps the key of his desk, itt being sealed up before four or five men. It has not been opened, nor nobody knowes what is in it. Desireing your Worships would be pleased to send somebody up as soone as possible you can. Here being not one dropp of liquor in the Castle, and the Blacks Christmas being just at hand, the Dutch Coapman being greatly in love with the Blacks, I think he may inveigle them to him, if they have not what they expect at the time. They are every day more and more in building, and it is likely to be a fine place."
1768,3,130,Captain Ned,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,28/06/1698,Fort,RAC,"My humble service to you all. May it please your worships I have herewith sent you a sheepe, which desire your Worshipps will be pleased to except [= accept] off, the Coapman being dead. Captain Dick and I was and are building a croome just by the Castle, which wee doe think may be good towards the Castle. Captain Billey and others are not very willing wee should build, but the Anta up country people are very willing, for it may be great cause of bringing trade to the Castle. Worthy Sirs, wee took advice with the Chiefe before he dyed, and he was very willing to it and soe wee did sett about it. Worthy Sirs, I desire you would be pleased to speak to the next Chiefe which comes up, that the building may goe on, for I am very willing to doe the English all the service I can."
1769,3,131,John Hust,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,30/06/1698,Fort,RAC,"Your two letters by the two hand canoe have received, and being informed it was the custome to open them, I did make bold, begging your Worshipps pardon if I have done amiss. Worthy Sirs, haveing returned the letters, there being money in one of them, which your worships will receive. Worthy Sirs, for shipping wee doe heare not of one of any sort. The man that Mr Vincent sent to Succondee brought word there was three gunns and Capt. Kempthorns boate and a five hand canoe, but for moveable things, they are all carryed away. The man that went brought with him 19 great shott, there being noe Blacks live there. The Dutch have withdrawne their fort and will not settle the[re] till the English are settled first, the Coapman which lived there is removed to Buttrew. As for the two slaves that was there, Mr Vincent has redeemed them, and one Cabo Corso man."
1770,3,132,Thomas Howard & John Hust,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,09/07/1698,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 30th June have received, and will take what possible care wee can of what your Worshipps have orderd to us. Worthy Sirs, wee cannott gett this man to inventory or any thing else, and here is goods goes out dayly, but upon what accompt wee know not. Worthy Sirs, for what Mr Vincent have left wee have taken an accompt of all, espetially odd things, they being in the Chiefs roome. Worthy Sirs, Mr Vincent has four men slaves in irons, and one girle and two canoemen pawns. Worthy Sirs Mr Vincents desk of which your Worships have the key, the seale was broaken since this man came here, not wholy, but wee doe think here is nothing diminished, or it was open'd. Worthy Sirs, wee looked over Mr Vincents things, wee found two letters for your Worships which came out of a Dutch interloper, they being in the Chiefs hands."
1771,3,133,Richard Sheldon,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,15/07/1698,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 5th and 12th instant, I received. Affter my arrivall here, I went with Mr Howard and Serjeant Hust, and unsealed Mr Vincents chamber doore, and found in his roome most of the Royall Companys goods, and accordingly took an inventory of them, whilst the said Mr Howard and Serjeant was present, likewise the apparrell of the deceased Mr Vincent. Affter that a Dutch interloper came into our road. Our gunns being then unloadded, I went with said Mr Howard and Serjeant and unsealed the Royall Companys warehouse doore, for powder to load the gunns, which was the reason of opening the warehouse. Likewise at the same time took out one chint and two pounds of beads, the above being present. The next day affter the inventory was taken I added them to the invoice, and shall make my selfe debtor in my accompts. This really is the truth. As for Mr Vincents pawnes &ca, [I] have [them] ready against the Gaily arrives, with the inventorys, but the Gaily is not yett arrived, she lyes as I am informed at Shuma, and has been there this 7 or 8 dayes. The difference betwixt Captain Nedd and Captain Billy is about building his house nearer this Castle, and to him I beleive I could make up this pallaver for a case or two of liquors, in the meane time I shall endeavour. I doubt not when your Worshipps receive Mr Vincents accompts to find your expectations answered as to the warehouse, which shall always be the endeavour of [myself].
PS. The information Mr Howard and the Serjeant gave your Worships was mearly out of mallis [= malice], because I threatned them about interlopeing goods which they had in the fort, likewise a slave which the Serjeant took upon him to buy and put in irons unknown to me in the fort."
1772,3,134,Richard Sheldon,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,15/07/1698,Fort,RAC,"Being informed last night of a Briggantine to windward, I immediately dispatched a canoe away to learne advice of the Captain if he heard of any Companys shipps to windward, who advises me that he left on the 7th instant at Cesters a Company shipp, The Prince of Orrange, Capt. Daniell Commander, she waited only for wind and weather when he left. Here inclosed is two letters directed to your Worshipps, which I found tyed up in a bagg among some other papers of Mr Vincents."
1773,3,135,Richard Sheldon,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,18/07/1698,Fort,RAC,"Hope by this time your Worshipps are partly made sencible that I have not been in this short time I have been here, so remiss in the Companyes affaires and your Worshipps orders, as you represent in your last, to deserve your just resentments or complaints. I received your Worshipps dated the 12th instant on the 14th, sent away the canoe with all the expedition I could, which was the next morning the 15th, with I hope a satisfactory answer, which I am sure your Worshipps will find to be true, as soone as you receive Mr Vincents accompts, which I shall take care to send, with slaves, pawnes &ca, as soone as ever the Gaily arives, which I will not detaine an hour longer then needs must. She lyes now as I am informed at Pompony, three leagues off. As for the two letters your Worshipps mention I sent inclosed in my last, which I found accidentally scattered in his roome, your Worshipps letter directed to the Generall of the Brandenbergs I sent away, and the other your Worshipps ordered me to deliver to some Dutch interloper, [I] delivered yesterday myselfe on board to the Captain myselfe, who promised me faithfully to deliver the same, the Commanders name is John Dooves. I am very impatient for the arrivall of the sloope, that your Worshipps may see all things faithfully stated, and I may noe longer lye under your Worships displeasure for want of a true information of things, and by the callumnys of some. Soe hopeing your Worships will, as I doubt not, give a favourable and impartiall construction to these.
PS. I am informed by Captain Nedd, who was yesterday at Buttrew, that a friend of his, a Cabbosheer resident there, advised him that he had private intelligence from the Mina that the Generall endeavours by large promises of money to engage some of the Anta Cabbosheers, espectially them in and about Buttrew, to endeavour to hinder the resettlement of the Royall Companys fort and factory at Succondee. Captain Nedd hath now 11 of his people in the Mina Castle, who lye for one mark, which if your Worships pleases to [r]emitt hither for the discharge of his the afforesaid people, hee promises to give his two sons for
pawnes, untill such time as he hath repayed the said mark, and as soone as he receives his afforesaid people, he promiseth to undertake to gett people to rebuild the afforesaid fort. This is what Captain Nedd informes me."
1774,3,136,Thomas Howard,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,25/07/1698,Fort,RAC,"These are humbly to give your Worships an accompt of what timber and iron work I have sent by returne of the sloope: 27 sawed pieces which may be usefull for window cases, door cases or axell trees for great gunns. I have a great deale of timber of all sorts ready cutt, and should have had a great deale more if I had received the iron work sooner. Worthy Sirs, I have returned three old broaken crowes, two shovells. The Castle will in a short time be finished, except your Worships will be pleased to have a tank made, which if there be it will require a great deale more lime, for it is not convenient to leave the Castle without lime.
An accompt of what iron work is wanting more, being needfull: 2000 of sixpenny and tenn penny nailes, three new trowells.
PS. Humbly desireing your Worships will be pleased to grant me liberty to come downe soone enough to goe home in this shipp, otherways humbly desire your Worships to let me goe in the first ship bound for Barbadoes that presents."
1775,3,137,Richard Sheldon,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,25/07/1698,Fort,RAC,"The Gaily came into this road the 24th instant. According to your orders I have sent you Mr Vincents things. I could not send them in his chests, he haveing sould it to Captain Ned sometime before his death, but have taken all the possible care I could of everything belonging to the afforesaid Mr Vincent. As for his debts I cannot as yett find out, but your Worshipps will as soone as you receive his desk, where I am informed all his accompts are inserted, both to white men and Black men, the key of which I suppose your Worships received before my arivall at this place, I found it safe locked and sealed. I have likewise sent one boy pawned by Captain Dickee for 12a as I am informed. Likewise two men and one girle slaves. He hath two more, whome the other night broke their irons and made their escapes, one of which runn to Captain Benns house at Buttrew, who promised to returne them both or money in two or three days time, which I shall take care to send downe the first opportunity. Here lyes some Dancra traders in the towne who wait for goods, therefore humbly desire your Worshipps [to send] a supply of sheets, pewter and brass, and what other goods your Worshipps thinks convenient the first opportunity.

The Dutchman comes with him again[st] Yankys cosen and the Adooms. He has sent 2 great guns out into the fields and planted them on a hill just by our fort. They have fought two dayes already, though to little purpose, but in 2 or 3 days they are to try their full force. By this oppertunity comes Robert Drummond souldier, he being such a d[r]uncken abuseive fellow that I could not rule him, he being containualy afighting and quareling with the rest of the souldiers and keeping a correspondance with the Dutch, [I] thought it safe to send him down.

For want of slaves to carry them into the Fort [I] imploy the towns women &ca for bringing them up into the Fort, who does require some small matter, which I leave to your consideration.

1837,3,199,Thomas Johnson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,27/09/1692,Fort,RAC,"By the Alligator sloop have received 3 small casks lime, which is already spent, so that without a further supply Thomas Wan the tanck maker must be idle as before for want of lime. The tanck is built at present about 10 foot depth, and doth require for finishing it above 16 cask lime, two casks hair and as the rest of the particulars. To have it arched or made flatt atop shall leave it to the judgment of the Surveyour. Sirs, att my first comeing here, haveing a great canoe then wanting canoemen as I wrotte you, and afterwards the mischance befaling the canoe and the 13 and 5 hand canoes long stay at Dickiescove when we had most occasione of them here, all these disapointments hath been the reason of the backwardnesse of the tanck. If lime be scarce, which may as well be wanting at Dickies Cove as this place, there are some places bettween Dickies Cove and this place where oystershells & wood are neer at hand to burn lime, if we be not hindred by the Dutch usage and frivoulous pretences. The Adoomes armey which lay neer Butterroe is withdrawen for the present, and one of their Cheif Captains came and told me that they have been often solicetated by the Dutch to molest and disturb the English settling at Dickies Cove, promiseing them great matters, which they refused, saying that they had no pallavers with the English and had given their voues [= vows] that they would not molest Dickies Cove, and after much pallaver the Cheif of Buttero drew out his pockett pistole and offred it to the breasts of some of the Adoomes, upon which they all gott over the river into Buttero Town, notwithstanding the Dutch fireing there great guns, and killed and took away severall prisoners and persued the rest to Dickies Cove, but would not molest Captain Dickie nor non of his Town people, I haveing ingadged Captain Anguiny, the Cheif Adoom man, not to desturb that place, you designeing to build their. Those goods I sell here the Blacks will not take out of the Factory but by night, for fear of the Dutch seizing of them, which in time may be a further hindrance to trade.

This accompanies my September accompts and ballance, being mk4 0o 8a 6ta of gold on accompt of the Royall African Company of England. Sirs, I have also received yours of primo instant, which gives me very bad and unwellcome news of the murther of John Gregory, for which I am heartily sorry. The Adoomes Generall is reinforceing his army by Kuferoes and Danckeras, and for his present designe I cannot for certaine writte you.

1839,3,201,Thomas Edwards,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,06/10/1692,Fort,RAC,"Mr Johnson tells me that I am accused by your Honours of ploting, conspireing and [being] one who formerly should be ane instrument of raiseing your souldiers in rebellion against you and the Royall Companies Fort of Admirality. Sirs, I cannot but with tears lament my unfortunat condition in being accused of that which (I swear before God Almighty) I am not guilty of, neither did I hear of any such. Indeed after Mr Elwes death, being in company with Mr Gregory, [I] was told his writte [= right] was to succeed and his life for the same would venture, and that Mr Ronan was imperious and cruell over those he had power over, and instanced his killing the chyrurgion of the ship he came over in after he had made peace with him and that he was the cause of the gunners death att the Hill by the Lewtenant, all which turned my inclinationes with the rest (altho indeed I had never any reasone to do or speak against Mr Ronan) to vote for Mr Gregory if it should come to a vote, wherefor I intreat you to have me free & and not suffer my good name to be inserted as an usurper or disturber of the Royall Company concerns. Sirs, you have alwayes showed me great and undeserved kindnese, and humbly begg youll consider me still and look upon me as [your most obliged, obedient and humble servant]."

1841,3,203,Thomas Edwards & Thomas Johnson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,19/10/1692,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 17th instant I received, this being my 3d answer. My first was of the 6th past in answer to yours of the 5th ditto, wherein you are pleased to charge me with plotting conspiracie a[i]ming the Royall Company ruine, which I do still say I am ignorant of what you do charge me, so do refer to your sounding the depth and then to know what you alleadge against me, and the second was by Hansico, by whom I sent with my accompts on accompt of the Royall African Company of England mkl 2oz 15 angles and 9 taccoes, and also a certificat by all the white men here to certify that I have not exacted nor extorted anything from any of the natives in this place, and with severall other matters which I hope will satisfy you, and I doubt not but plainly to clear your charge, which you are not realy possitive in. When the 3 marchants place was vacant by the death of Mr Elwes, then understanding that Mr Ronan was to succeed I spoke some words to the Chaiplain and severall other Gentlemen att table and also to yourself [i.e. Joshua Platt] and Mr Whiting and received a very satisfactory answer, and since what I wrote to Mr Gregory, being one of the Chiefe marchantts (Mr Platt the 1st and particularly from the Company), I am sure there was no plotting, conspiracie and endeavouring to make the souldiers lay down their armes, aiming the totall ruine of the Royall Company. Sirs, I am an English man & a Protistant, who never were counted plotters. As far as I wrotte you concerning lime to be made at Taccarado or thereabouts I cannot perceive how I have contradicted it, without it was to exprese the mallicious & frevoulus pretences which the Dutch too often make in pretending rights to places that they have nothing to do with all. The Dutch Cheif at Buttroe stoped this letter of the Surveyours, which was afterwards sent hither by sea, so for the future I cannot expect to send by land."
1842,3,204,Thomas Johnson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,28/10/1692,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 25th past have per Mr Jeffryes received with some lime, which will not finish the tanck, as I formerly wrotte for 6 hogsheads. No news from windward."
1843,3,205,Thomas Johnson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,07/11/1692,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 3d instant have received and the inclosed were sent by sea. Non of our slaves dare venture to go by land, one of them since I formerly wrote you haveing received some cutts on his hand and foot in strugling to gett from the Dutch slaves when they seized him. This accompanys my October accompt and ballance, being one ounce 15 angles and 11 taccoes on accompt of the Royall African Company of England, and inclosed comes also the particulars of the Dickies Cove slaves pay.
[PS] Be pleased by the returne of the 5 hand canoe to send us some casks of good water, which we are in great need of, & some looks [= locks] and keys for the gates of the Fort."
1844,3,206,Thomas Wann,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,08/11/1692,Fort,RAC,"Mr Johnson informes that your Worshipps wrote him that you cannot understand I should have occasione for so much lime, haveing sent sufficent to build such a tanck as your Worshipps supposeth it to be, so I have made bold to give your Worshipps the peruseall of a small epistle, the subject of which is to acquaint your Worshipps of my present occasion. Imprimis I shall want 30 deall boards, 200 bradd nails, a ladder, with about as much more lime, which I impute [= compute] to be 20 quarter casks. I request your Worshipps consideration. The to [sic] tanck consists of 16 foot in the clear diamiter, 13 foot depth and will contain about 60 tun of water. Likewise if the swich [= swish] had not [been] extraordinary it would have occasion for a considerable quantity more. The timber I have in areadiness in order for covering the tanck, so that if your Worshipps will be so pleased to order me what I have here above speciefyed there shall neither be care nor diligence in me wanting towards the finishing of it. The tanck had been performed long since had I been supplyd with stuff and slaves. What already is done was performed by myself, which I find very hard without the assistance of some trouell [= trowel] men, but as I have promised your Worshipps to finish what I have undertaken (God preserveing my life and health) I will performe my word, desireing in the conclusion that your Worshipps will be so favorable, the next English ship that comes, if my [ms. 'any'] work performed, haveing my discharge from the Royall Company and my time expired, to grant my passage for England and in so doeing your Worshipps will very much assist [me].
[PS] Upon a second consideration that if your Worshipps are pleased to order timber to be cut at Dickies Cove and conveyed to Succondee we shall have no occasion for deall boards or naills."
1845,3,207,Thomas Johnson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,12/11/1692,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 11th instant I received and for your satisfaction have sent down the slave who is not fitt for service by the injury he received from the Dutch people by carrying a letter to Dickies Cove, and as to what the Generall writes in defence, I will prove by all the White men that the Company slaves are here no otherwise imployed then aboute the Companys bussinese here, about the Fort and sometimes a carrying a letter to Dickies Cove, and do not goe apadling [= peddling] about the country for me nor non that lives under me, neither do our slaves abuse any of them, being alwayes at work, but it is verry plain their slaves hinders our traders, for when they buy any goods they are forcied to take them out in the night for fear of being seized, and the Coopeman of Sumay and this place never made any complaint to me of our slaves abuseing any of theirs, so that you may see he hath nothing elce to bring them off but by such excuses. I do not know wherein I have neglected the Companys bussinese, I have at all times observed your orders, which shall not be wanting in me, and as for writting the duplicats of accompts I have no paper, which could I gett should never be the occasion of your displeasure. Thomas Wann, who is sick, hath received 3 casks lime, and he saith without you will be pleased to send the lime he wrotte for (20 hogsheads) he cannot finish the tanck. Mr Clarkson had the inventory of the necissaries of the Castle, I have wrotte him about it.
[PS] Mr Rynhout is removed from Sumay, its said he goes to Axim, the Generalls brother supplies his place.
PS. As concerning Taggaba, its aboute 3 weeks since came here one of her canoes from Axim who put in here for water. I haveing a letter then of the Surveyours which I gave the canoemen and two taccoes, they being bound to Cabo Corso Castle, for which they ask 3 angles, and since the same canoe men came here with your letter of the 3d past with another for the Surveyor [and] I could not then send by land, I was forcied to make use of the canoe, and when they were up Mr Jeffryes toke [= took] their small canoe and [I] put the 2 canoe men in the 5 hand canoe that came down the other day and now in [the] 5 hand up again, for which theask [= task] imployed them no more then from this place to Dickies Cove, becaus I could not send by land, and they being Cabo Corso canoemen I judged they might be paid at Cabo Corso for their whole voyage to Dickies Cove as useual. I would pay the fellow for his voyage from this place to Dickes Cove but he will not take it."
1846,3,208,Thomas Johnson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,14/11/1692,Fort,RAC,"This canoe comes on my charge with the slave I mentioned in my last of 12th past, who was left behind by the overhastinese of the canoemen.

1849,3,211,Samuel Lassar,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,20/11/1692,Fort,RAC,"Your complyance with my former desires moves me to render my most humble and hearty thanks to your Worshipps for the same. I am informed by the Dutch Coopeman here the Doctor of the Windhound will be disposed of for the Mina or some place elce and they want serurgeon [= surgeon] to go home, so that if your Worshipps will please to grant me liberty to come to Cabo Corso and give me a line to the Generall of the Mina it may tend somewhat to my advantage and likewise have my passage free, which will do me a great kindnese, for I have made but a small proffite from the time I have been here, in doeing whereof you will greatly oblidge [me]."

On the 6th instant pased by her[e] a Dutch Companys ship formerly called the African being her 5 month voyage from Zelland. The carpenter Pimm stands in great need of pitch and tarr to mend the Companys great canoe to fetch stones from the other side of the bay for the tanck being now overlayed with timber.

The carpenter is now (the deall boards being slitted at Dickies Cove) goeing about makeing the spouts. We have been makeing a lime keall [= kill] and this day proved the effects of it in order of covering the beams over the tank, for which we want two iron bound bucketts and some roap. Pray send also half a sheet of lead.
[PS] Be pleased to send some alejars and silk longees. This day two Dutch and one English interloper sailled down to leeward from these parts, haveing laid at anchor 2 dayes."

I have nothing elce at present worth adviseing, Generall Auquan the Adoomes [omission], as I am informed, being disappointed of the quantity of men he expected in order to his march toward Occqueda. I may by the next give you a better accompt of the state of affairs per the next in these places."

We stand much in need of a new flagg and some locks for use of the gates of the Fort."

1858,3,220,Thomas Johnson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,11/02/1693,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 4th instant have received with 1 quarter cask of rum, which I shall give the Royall Company credit for accordingly. The slaves are at present imployed in mending and thatching the out walls against the rain time, they will have done in a very short time. The army that have so long encamped neer these parts are now on their march, so that we hope in a little time to have ane occasion for goods.

1860,3,222,Thomas Johnson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,31/08/1693,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 25th past I received, by which understand my linguister hath been to make his complaint as that I have not paid him. He stole from me some time since 6 peas and 3 angles. The matter being so plaine against him, I by his earnest request, he being an old man and a servant to the Company & his promising satisffaction, I did not then take notice as in case of theft is deserveable, and as for the waiges he has never been out of my debt since I came here, besides what he stole, and since his returne he hath in the presence of Mr Rives paid me in part of the accompt between us 6 peas 3an. The reports of Blacks guilty in this maner I hope are not valued. There are others that owe me money and are unwiling to pay and may give you the like trouble. Here is Captain Anta, who is now afraid to come nere this factory by the Dutch threatning, hath not received as you may perceive by my accompts his sallary this many months, therefore I have not charged it. Whe[n] Adoe Ahensa comes he shall be very Wellcome & kindly received as a trader."
1861,3,223,Thomas Johnson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,28/09/1693,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 27th past have received & the contents therein shall be obeyed. I returne you thanks for sending me the two men. The very small matter of money that hath been taken for these two months past by myself (and in my absence by Mr Rivers [= Rives]) will not answer the charges of the factory, & the late raines we have had here hath leaked down into my roome that I canot lye dry & securely in the hall. I desire you will send Richard Richardson to view the same. The carriages of the guns which were mended about six months past are much rotten & requires new, with severall necessaryes as here under written. The reason I did not acquaint you of them when down, is by reason of my longe sickness, that I did not know nor see the same.
PS. nailes of all sorts, cartridge paper, ladles, spunge staffs, worms, skins of sheep, twine with needles, deale boards a few."

Have also received yours of the 7 past with the nails. I wish you could have spared more, all the shelves in the warehouse being rotten and falne [= fallen] downe, that the goods are forced to lye on the ground for want of boards and plank. Also as for the present affairs with the Adooms and Antas, there are such various discourses abroad that I cannott advise you any thing certainly."
1864,3,226,Thomas Johnson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,21/10/1693,Fort,RAC,"I thought for to send you these inclosed, by which you may see how the affairs goe at Dickis Cove. Here are reports by the blacks of an altercation there, which I hope will not prove true. Wee are a burning of lyme, and I hope in a little tyme shall have soe much as our occasion shall serve for when you please for to send up the surveyor or a bricklayer. Sir, I doe humbly beg of you that you would bee pleased to afford mee what medicines the Castle hath.

I find the major part of you are not as well acquainted in the business as Mr William Ronan is, therefore referr you to my letter to him of the 7th instant. I would have waited on you sooner then this letter, that by verbally the businesse might bee better understood, but was hindred by not haveing the use of my lymbs, and in the interim shall take care that noe injury shall come to the Company, and myselfe to, having received a great deal already, Mr William Ronan having received eight ounces eight angles from those that have injured mee in part of satisfaction. I therefore appeall to you to know who is in the wrong or whether I am the ogressor [= aggressor] or noe. Soe hoping in a short tyme to waite upon you."

1873,3,235,Thomas Johnson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,21/12/1693,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 14th instant I received. I would very willingly have waited upon you, but being newly recovered cannot be able soe soon to make such a voyage, but hope by the end of the month to come with my accompt. As concerning the slaves that are runn away, it is not from anything of severity shown by mee. Itt is very hard for the white men to live here, by reason wee can scarce gett victualls to putt in our mouths, and much more for the slaves, which I hear to bee their complaint. Hopeing to have strength in a little time to performe the voyage."

perpetuanoes and other interloping goods. One of the white men (by name
Benjamin Sewell) being then at the waterside, did offer to seize the same but was very much beaten by them, one holdeing him and the other holding a naked knife at his breast whilst the rest beate him. I have with much difficulty seized on one of them with the canoe, soe crave your orders for my government herein, which shall be observed."
1875,3,237,Thomas Johnson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,15/01/1694,Fort,RAC,"By this have sent you two ounces seaven taccooes and half, being the estate of William Harden deceased, deducting fourteen angles and nyne taccooes due."

According to your commands shall treate Adua Kensah [= Hensah] and those his people that may come, and give all encouragement possible for the keepeing the way open. Adoom Assherry that lives up Sumay River and Jappo that liveson this side of Sumay are the only men to bee encouraged. Shall want some cloaths for the same purpose."
1879,3,241,Thomas Johnson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,25/02/1694,Fort,RAC,"This serves onely to advise you that Adua Hensa's people was here and bought a parcell of knives and perpetuanoes, which were seized on by the Copeman of Shuma and they themselves are confined in their prison, soe desire you would bee pleased to send your orders, that wee may paniair other people to gett our traders goods againe, for they are resolved not to buy their goods here unlesse wee can protect them. They [= the Dutch] are dayly panyaring their goods and confining the men. Wee may bee in likelyhood of a good trade, provided wee can protect our traders. The Dutch are constantly selling [= seizing] a goods, and those that wee sell wee are forced to send away by night, but still they are seized on, soe desire you would bee pleased to seize on a Dutchman or two, to make us satisfaction for the affront received, or doe you seize upon the Copeman of Morea and Cormantine, who you have dayly at your Fort. Lett not the Company bee abused and laughed at by the Dutch, who dayly makes it their business to molest them.
[PS] I am very bad and have been troubled with convulsion fitts and am now in a very bad condition, as Capt. Shirley and Capt. Phillips can both informe you."
1880,3,242,Thomas Johnson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,10/03/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 21st of February received by Captain Anta, to whom I have paid his sallary for January & February last, and according to your orders have advanced him one bendy, which goods no sooner carried out of the Fort but were seized upon to pay his debts. He is a man that does not vallow me but stands in great awe of the Dutch, as all these people doe. This accompanyes Aduhenyusis boy, who is come to make his complaint and desire your assistance against the Dutch for molesting their trade and seizeing their goods continually. I never heard that ever we panyard any of their goods, and we have as much reason to doe it as they, and it is the greatest affront imaginable that they should molest our trade. I have this day received yours of the 6th of March with six yards of scarlett cloth, which shall be disposed of according to your orders. I cannot yett send downe my accompts, but soe soon as I am a little better they shall be sent downe.
PS. You mentioned in yours of the 21st of February that you were informed that I pinyard the people of this place that I am not concerned withall, which indeed, Sirs, is a mistake, I have trusted them money and have pynyard them when they could not pay me, and severall others owe me for goods, and likewise Captain Anta, and must I not pynyard them if they will not pay me? My promoting of the Companies interest is the promoting my owne. Mr Pinck & all the white men are sick of a feaver."
1881,3,243,Thomas Johnson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,15/03/1694,Fort,RAC,"This comes to acquaint you that Benjamin Sevell dyed the 10th and John Warrington the 14th instant, the former of which being worth little and the other haveing his money out amongst the Blacks, have found but 12a in gold and nothing else but his necessary clothes. We are for the most part very much out of order & sickly, soe desire you will send up 3 or 4 men and lett me order that one of them may have some allowance above the rest to act as Serjant and Gunner. Aduhenna his boy has been with you these seven dayes, soe I hope you have done something as to the encouragement of trade. Some of Aduhenna his boyes in these few dayes have been here and tells he will send noe more money here, for they see that we are not able to protect their goods nor recover those that are painyard, which is a great prejudice to the Company. There comes inclosed an inventory of the estate of John Warrington and I shall use your orders how they shall be disposed, whether I shall sell them here or send them downe to Cabo Corso. Benjam Sevell had no more than what he was buried with except an old coate and paire of drawers, both not wortth 6ta.
PS. Warrington hath a boy which I will buy if you please. He hath abundance of outstanding debts by the blacks his wench who is run away knows off."
1882,3,244,Thomas Johnson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,22/03/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 16th instant I have received with the new Generall Staphorst['s] letter, the interpretation of which you will find very insignificant and a mere flame [=flam]. You are sencible when he lived at Morea, when very much inferiour to what he is now, he could disputt with you as his equalls, much more now he is in his new place. Where [= were] he or the Coapeman of Shuma in


another, I could soon tell them that they are in the wrong, for there was no interlopers att that time from Cape Tres Pointas to Agga.
Such an affront as this might be soon and easily remedied. I have two Dutchmen on my right hand and as many more on my left. Those blacks that you call our poor friends they love us but are afraid of the Dutch, and what conduces more to a trade then fear? The Dutchman my neighbour his people sent him from Mina, Comenda, Shuma &ca by the Generalls order to gett fish for them, but wee have none to gett fish for us [ms. 'use'] but are forced to stand to their curtisie [= courtesy] for what they please to give use for our money. As for proving of the goods to be ours, the circumstances are soe plaine that it needs no proofe. The traders in my predecessors tyme they were Wassaws, [who] live quite another way from what the Cufferes [var. 'Croffies'] doe. Since I have received yours of the 19th ditto, and give you thanks for sending me those two men in the roome of those deceased. By this comes the estate of the deceased John Warrington who in his sickness had nobody to look after him but his black wench, who immediately after his death run away unknown to any but those of her couler [= colour]. Wee have soe much sicknesse here that the living could scarce see the dead interr'd.
Bradua Ahenesa grows now very strange, and am affraid he will make his words good. I may presume to say that there is nothing wanting in me to the encouragement [of] a trade. I have given encouragement for a trade in a place where I have not had my health nor the use of my limbs for this fifteen months, as you are all sencible of itt. Sirs, I have often wrote to you the bad condition of this fort, and 'tis a hard case I cannot have a dry roome to lie in."
1883,3,245,Thomas Johnson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,24/03/1694,Fort,RAC,"My last to you was of the 22d past. Since dyed Mr Charles Hamilton, and hath made his executor Mr John Pinck."
1884,3,246,Thomas Johnson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,30/03/1694,Fort,RAC,"Haveing this opportunity of a canoe bound to Cabo Corsoe, to certifie you that yours of the 24th instant I have received. I need not to prove any further, but that we may now as well beleive Ado Henasa and his people that the goods were his that were seized at Chuma, as we beleived him when his goods were seized at Comenda, and in my predecessors time I know & saw with my eyes that the Blacks bought goods in the factory and carried out in the night, and soe they did when I first came and have ever since, and who can wee judge these people to be afraid of? Sirs, I doe desire your leaves to come to Cabo Corsoe in a few days and then I shall give you an accompt more plaine & large then this short time will permitt. Sirs, I am very sorry that you should againe say that I doe not obey your orders, for if you will inquire of the great canoe you will finde that I sent Warringtons things therein, and 'tis a little to hard for me to pay the charge of a canoe to carry downe the Generalls letter which you sent to me to translate. The inclosed is an account between John Warrington and me as my second. Sirs, there are severall others that are deseased indebted to me. I desire you will be pleased to take notice of it. Inclosed comes the copy of the deseased Charles Hamiltons will."
1885,3,247,Thomas Johnson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,12/04/1694,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys my February & March accompts with the ballance, being one marke five ounces & seven angles & eleven taccoes."
1886,3,248,John Pink,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,17/04/1694,Fort,RAC,"This comes to desire you to send per bearer sixteen or seventeen ounces of corrall, here being an Adoom Cabbosheers that wants soe much.
PS. The Fort is ready to fall downe about our eares, the maine guirders [= girders] being rotten in [the] walls, unless speedily prevented"
1887,3,249,John Pink,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,08/05/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 18th of Aprill I have received with a parcell of corrall mentioned to contain 78_ oz. On weighing the same without its [w]rapper or cover found it to weigh but seventy six ounces, for which I give the Royall Company creditt. With this comes my Aprill accompts ballanced. By this have sent seven of the Companyes old musketts not fitt service, desire others in their roome, and also some muskett shott, and 3 or 4 scaines of English match. I trouble you once more to lett you know the great occasion wee have here for both carpenter & bricklayer, for now the frequent raines we have here doth us more injury. The carriages of our guns are rotten, and some of them have none, when they were lately mended they had nothing but new wheels. As also our warehouse lately which had nothing done, for want of boards, but two or tree sticks or props put up. And by reason of such botching we are continually wanting. By this I have sent you downe according to your commands the last will of Mr Charles Hamilton deceased to be registered."
1888,3,250,John Pink,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,15/05/1694,Fort,RAC,"This serves only to advise you that the country is again up in armes, by the roguery of the Dutch, & their party, [they] doe threaten the surprisall of this place, as they formerly did in my predecessors time. Wee cannot bee too carefull in watching such dangerous enemies, haveing an instance of the Danes sufferings before our eyes. We are thus informed dayly by the Blacks, who tell it for a great secrett, soe desireing you will please to send three or four men more, it being very hard for four men to doe duty day & night, which we are forced to keep them to, itt being my part to acquaint as near as I can learne."
1889,3,251,John Pink,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,21/05/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 18th instant I received with two white men, and seven musquets. Anta Sherry [= Asherry] by the Dutch assistance is released from the Brandenburgh, and is now att Butteroe makeing great preparations for warrs, and most of the Blacks liveing with my neighbour are gone to his party, and they are soe confident that they shall gett the day that they doe allready begin to play the rogue in hindering these poore women and children that live under our protection from buying corne, fish or wood, as likewise our owne slaves. I doe not know what will be the effects of such practizes, time will learn us. Captain Anta, to whome you have given his sallary and advanced money to build him a house, dare not goe through with it for fear of the Dutch, neither can he come from the Dutch towne (the place of his abode) to see me [ms. 'seem'] but with the Dutchmans leave. I shall obey your orders in keeping a faire correspondency between both parties and trouble myself with none."
1890,3,252,John Pink,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,09/06/1694,Fort,RAC,"This serves to advise you that on the 4th instant arrived Mr William Smith and Mr Edward Barter, and on the 6th ditto Anta Sherry, who has pitched his camp between the two Forts. I sent to him to know what was his designe, he told me that he had nothing to say to us, but soon after he began to destroy and take away our peoples houses. I sent to forbid him to go on. and my linguister asked him why he did not goe to the Dutch and take thatch, his answer was that the Dutch were his friends and he had no pallaver with them. According to your orders that I should concerne myself with none, I sent him word not to lett his people come within a limited place, but not withstanding my soe many warnings they would be intruding upon our liberties, and this present instant were intruding. I fired over them, upon which they fired again, narrowly missing John Pinck, and hitt a boy behind him, upon which the Dutchman hoisted his flagg in their camp and I hoisted ours, and shall stand by it as long as I have a drop of blood in my body. This comes express and is to desire you to send us some beef, bread & oyle, or else now wee may starve, being upon our defence. Mr Smith came ashore sick and has been soe ever since. I myself can scarce gett off my bedd, and one of our men [also]. I know no reason the Dutch should encourage them as to lend them the flagg to plant it or lett it blow under the command of my gunns, when they have already acted in hostile manner against me. Pray send me some sheep skins, small nailes, bandiliers, cathrrage paper, rammers & spunge staves, small wire, and be pleased to lett the carpenter come & bring some board & planks to make carriages, for we have scarce one fitt for service and we are much necessitated for them. Which is what for the present offers, being in haste."
1891,3,253,John Pink,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,09/06/1694,Fort,RAC,"Mine of this date at 10 a clock and [advising] of the danger we are in of Anta Sherry, haveing offered me severall affronts and haveing planted the Dutch flagg, after which I could not by noe means thinck myselfe secure, he encroaching upon our liberties. According to your orders thought fitt to trust none. Seeing he could not be keept off us, according to your commands I gave him orders to retire, which they tooke no notice on. According to your orders that I am to trust none, thought fitt in defence of myself to fire at him, to keep him off by fireing at him. They came into the towne where our people formerly lived and sett itt on fire. Wee then soone engaged them with all our force, notwithstanding their attempts were soe bold to sett our slaves houses, corne houses &ca on fire about us, which much endangered the Fort, in soe much that there was not a window about us but were filled with shott, they being soe lowe, wee haveing but seven men, three of them being wounded at the first engagement, we had then little assistance. I have lost abundance of my owne people, two of the Companyes slaves wounded, I doe not know whether they be dead or noe, being in haste, neither can I in reallity say whether I can at this maintaine the Fort or no, but there shall be nothing wanting in me. People that were with me in my roome and warehouse were wounded, shotts comeing thro both. I was forced to come to a parley, most of my people being wounded and the rest out of heart. Soone after came the Dutchman my neighbour, who soon after came here, nothing discommended the blowing of the flagg and the couradge of the people, saying they had the flagg by orders. Sirs, I allways advised you that he was an enimy to us and [there was] noe trusting of him. Take what the present offers, being in great danger att this time. I had the luck to have Mr Barter, who has behaved himself very valliantly, who after John Pinck was wounded was everywhere his presence was necessary. Our granadoe shells, which wee soe much wanted, were not worth that name, scarce three of them being filled. I have lost all my sheep, goats & provisions, and I have nothing left wherewith to keep me & my men, but must starve without your immediate supply. Lee, one of the Companys slaves, is panyard by them. I am in haste."
1892,3,254,Edward Barter,n.p.,,Cape Coast Castle,10/06/1694,Fort,RAC,"These serves only to advise you that Anta Asherry demands three case bottles of rumme more & two whole barrels of powder before he will come to any agreement with you. Therefore I desire you to give him what he demands at present, and I beleive the latter palaver will be nothing more, upon the provisall you will be true to him and he to you in takeing feteches togather, and I am sure you will not come off under one whole barrell, therefore send him word you cannot and have noe more than one whole barrell with three case bottles of rumme, for I find your neigbour is not of our side, and pray take my advice."
1893,3,255,Thomas Johnson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,14/06/1694,Fort,RAC,"I hope ere this you have with you Mr John Pinck, who departed from hence yesterday with our wounded men. I would then have wrote you. but being then very much indisposed I could not, soe referred him to you. What I have done hath been nothing but what was in my owne defence, and that I had understood of his [= Asherry's] many threatnings and he being soe much encouraged by the Dutch, haveing their flagg which they blanded [= brandished] in opposition to me, and with them the Dutch Generalls boy & staff. They would neither give me my assurance nor be limitted to any reasonable bounds, that I could think myself secure, knowing well that there is little confidence in a Dutch & there adherences [= adherents], [having] well experienced it before I came in these parts. Those my present enemie could never have the knowledge and courage to have gott soe on were they not instructed by some Europian. After wee had soe fired on our owne defence, before we could load our great gunns againe most of our white men were wounded, our thatch walls on fire. On my side I have noe black men with me except women & children and some few boyes, which are of little service. With our lower ports to clear the enemy from the door and windows, we played our parts, and when any of them that engaged us fell or wounded their places were soon supplyed by the great numbers that were of them, most of my people wounded or killed, the night comeing on, and being surrounded both with fire & the enemie, I thought it better and the safer way than to hazard all, to call out to them to come to a parlie. They would not comply untill they saw the Dutch Cheif comeing towards them, soe they left off and were came to a pallaver the next morning, sessation [= cessation] of armes agreed off on both sides for twelve dayes, but notwithstanding I every day [am] anoyed by their blundering [= plundering] all they can from me, which I [am] forced to beare by reason I have but two white men fitt for service, myself being both sick & lame, and noe provisions, otherwise I should not beare [it]. All those people which promised Jappo help, the Dutch Generall have ingaged to desist and with threatenings that if they should assist Jappo [he] will bring on them the up country people to destroy them, soe that Jappo cannot now appeare against the enemie wee stand in danger of. They goe with the Dutch flagg, and is encouraged & directed both by the Dutch Chief here and he that lives at Butteroe, who followed them here, which he could not lie out of his Fort without orders from his Generall. Anta Asherry with the help of the Dutch hired a great quantity of people from Dickies Cove, did us a great deale of hurt after wee had soe agreed, they would not forbare, still take away every thing I sent to be dressed, seazing from the slaves fowles & every thing they could gett, which I [am] forced to beare with, haveing but two white men fitt to ingage & noe provision, they haveing prevented us. Since I have had the bad luck to see this ugly bussiness, would gladly see an end. These things would had been putt in execution before had not Jappo and Auguan beaten them. Just now arrived Amo, to whom I referr."
1894,3,256,William Gabb,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,24/04/1698,Fort,RAC,"This comes humbly to acquaint your Worshipps I could not gett hither till this morning about 3 a clock. As soone as twas day the towns people was all on the sands. I went ashore, they sent for Ringoo, King of the Doomes. The Cabbosheers was earnest to have the flagg hoysted, which I did as soone as possible. The Dutch Coapman sent his cane to me three times before I had done. The fourth time he sent to demand of me the reason I did not come to him, he sending so often, for all palavers must be made in his Castle. Then I sent to tell him I was about my masters business, but by and by should be at leasure, and would meet him anywhere out of his Castle, so wee mett betweene the Castles. He asked me if your Worshipps had told the Generall of the Mina that you would settle againe at this place. I told him that was not my business to enquire affter. He said he thought the Dutch and English was friends. Yes, said I, and it may be best to keepe soe, and with a few words wee parted, but understand he is displeased and doe write to the Mine this night. About four this affternoone, the King came hither with a great guard. He came to me and then went to the Dutch Castle, but did not tarry above a quarter of an houre, then came to our side, where wee had a long palaver to that purpose, that he did promise your Worshipps that his people should help to build the Castle, which he will doe, and tarry here himselfe alwayes, if your Worshipps will please to goe about it presently, and send workmen and souldiers, and great gunns to defend the place, because he heard that some of the Anntar people did say, if any Englishman came to settle here, they would kill every man, but if your Worshipps will please to send men and gunns aforesaid, he would take care of all pallavers, that none should interupt the building, and say he love no roagues pallavers, if he did he would goe to the Dutch. He added that when the Dankeryes fought the Doomes, that some of em went to Cabo Corso for shelter, and the Admirall delivered him [= them] to their enemies, and if the English would doe so any more, I should tell him off it, for he did not love to be deceived, to which I told him he need not feare, but your Worshipps would be reall to him in all you promised, [and he said] that when he sent heads by his cozen to Cabo Corso when he fought the Antas and beat them, and Mr Ronan put him in irons, which he took very ill, and that he would have Adoe taken out of the ring [which] he understood by Addico he had on, and that he would not have Amuffoe, which killed Mr Johnson, come here any more, but desire your Worshipps would send him to Barbadoes, or to the Royall Company in England, and tell them that was the man that killed one of their Cheifs at Succondee. If your Worshipps cannot doe one of these, he cannot live with the English more. He desires your Worshipps will write to the Generall of the Mina, that you have taken possession of the fort at Succondee. This is the import of the palaver, for I wrote in my pockquett book as twas told me. Part of the fort is fallen downe, and part is crackt, that it must be taken downe, and other part may be secured, but have not had time to examine it well, but will speedily and give your Worshipps a just accompt.
PS. I have not yet had time to write to Dickes Cove, but will before I sleepe. I cannot find where to have stones to build, but think the earth will make good bricks, which will examine and give you an accompt. I doubt here will require a great expence of liquors, therefore desire your Worshipps will please to send more by first, and a little Barbadoes rumme for my selfe, here being nothing to be had for money. I desine to beginn clearing tomorrow about the Castle. Nothing will sattisfie em but the above written, therefore humbly desire your Worshipps directions. I gave the King and Cheife Cabbosheers the caske of rumme your Worshipps ordered, and have spent part [of] the other."
1895,3,257,William Gabb,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,27/04/1698,Fort,RAC,"This comes humbly to acquaint your Worshipps that since my last have had severall pallavers with the King and Cheife Cabbosheers, and all end well, they promise thatt all their people shall doe any thing I sett them about. Yesterday some of the people found a faulcon gunn, she seemes very good, in the grass neare the Dutch fort. I gott the Blacks to bring it on our side. I gave them a large dramm, but they desire some dashee of your Worshipps for itt. I perceive the others are in this country, but cannot know till Sonday, neither will the[y] begin to work till then. This morning early the King sent to me and said a messenger from a friend at Butterow tell him that the Generall of the Mina sent to one Jiem, brother to Amiso that killed Mr Johnson, to demand twenty bendyes [which] he gave him to take the English fort here and cutt off the Cheifs head, but he not being able to pay it is commanded to muster up his people to fight the Doomes and drive away the English againe from hence. The King sayes he expects they will come, so I have prevailed with him and some Cabbosheers to send for their forces, which will be here tomorrow, which was not to come till Sonday. All are very urgent to write presently to your Worshipps to desire white souldiers, powder, shott and some great gunns with all speed to plant on the hill by the Castle, to be shelter if surprized and oblidged to retreat, which if your Worshipps please to send I with their assistance can presently runn up a swish wall round the Castle, which shall be suffitient to secure us till the other be in order. The joyce in the vaulte are very fitt for this place, if your Worshipps please to send with a carpenter, wee can be makeing things ready. So humbly desireing your Worshipps derections.
PS. The King gave the sheep I brought up to the white men that was killed in the Castle, and his fetish tells him, if he doe not give one for the Castle, it will not doe well, so he desires one of your Worshipps. I have tryed the earth in severall places, and part of it will make good bricks. I sent the great canoe for Dickes Cove betimes a Monday, with an accompt of timber for this place. The King and people will not lett me rest till I send this canoe, which I was unwilling to doe before received the other, but they urge the enemye will be speedily with us."
1896,3,258,William Gabb,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,03/05/1698,Fort,RAC,"These comes humbly to acquaint your Worshipps I received yours of Aprill 26th with the caske rumme. Worthy Sirs, I have endeavoured to know the minds of the King and Cabbosheers, and they alwayes promise to assist with all their strenght to the building the fort, and that [they] try with the free consent of all that the English should now be settled in that fort againe, and if any enemie should endeavour to hinder or hurt any Englishman here, they would fight him to the utmost of their power. The King have had dealing with the Dutch some time since I have been here, butt he tells me if the English have goods here as he want he will never have to doe with them againe, and if they bring an enemie to hurt us here they will take their Castle. But Sonday being wett and Monday was the day to begin to work, they told me they would not build a house nore doe any thing, till your Worshipps had sent the things I wrote for last, and that your Worshipps promised to send the King seaven bendyes more, and that they had no provitions to eat, and if they worked they would be paid, unto which I told them they had promised your Worshipps to build the house, and to help build the Castle, and in all their pallavers they had promised me the same, and thatt all their men should doe any thing I sett them about, but if they would not doe every thing they promised I had orders to take downe the flagg and begone, and that your Worshipps was not so ill beloved but had all the country thereabouts at your command, and would take some other way to have the fort againe. Then the Cabbosheers told the King he must make the house and they would doe all they promised, which accordingly they sent their men for wood and have been at work this two dayes, and will finish itt in two or three more. They desire the gunns &ca wrote for, and the King desire your Worshipps to send him the seaven bendyes, and one bendy to buy the mens provitions while the fort is building. I have sent your Worshipps a ruff [= rough] draught of the old fort, and the dementions of the ground, and what addishions may be made if your Worshipps think well of itt, and that the hill may be fortified with a ranpier [= rampart] and parrapett erected with earth, and doubt not but it will be of great use, which beleive your Worshipps will like well if itt was done. The earth by the Castle is good to make bricks, and here is no good stone to be digged in these parts. The earth will work the better to be digged now, and lye in the raine some time, and if your Worshipps please to have these things done, here will want some of the slaves that have made bricks, and some that can speak English, to tell the people what they must doe, and some of your bricklayers, six or eight iron shovels, six pickaxes, two or three dozen crews to carry earth, one grindstone. Pray please to send a carpenter with stuff to make a strong doore and doore case to the Castle, and as soone as can have stuff wee can be makeing things ready, which will soone be wanted when the bricklayers are at worke. Pray be pleased to order the smith to make me some locks, to secure my things, for I loose somthing every day amongst that crew. I shall want some old door or somthing to make one for the new house, some stong twine for lines. The thinmost of the planks that came in the great cano will make a carriage for the gunn here, if your Worshipps please to send [it] with trucks, I can gett axell trees here. Lime will be wanting before wee begin to work on the Castle. Here is wood enough to burne bricks and lime grow neare the fort. I have done what I can with these slaves to rowsaw and cleare about the fort, to make it fitt to worke. I humbly desire your Worshipps will please to order me which way you like best to goe on with the fort, and send whatt supplyes your Worshipps can spare, and with Gods assistance I will goe on with all the strength I have according to your orders.
PS. I understand they have more bricks burnt at Dickes Cove then have occasion for, if your Worshipps please to order some here wee could be repairing part of the fort, before others can be ready. I humbly desire your Worshipps will please to order your Steward to send me some provitions and some Barbadoes rumme I wrote to him for. The King will not drink Portuguese rumme but come to me every day for punch and a dram I had for my selfe, till I have none left. I find he love his belly well. If your Worshipps please to send a little corne brandy to humour his body, till the Fort is in good order, I will doe the best I can to mannage him. I humbly desire your Worships will please to send rowle [= roll] of tobaccoe, for the people goe to the Dutch for some. Abram, Bribbee, Quacoo and Affado and others at Commenda doe but break stone, others can doe there as well if your Worshipps please to send some of them. There is a long ladder and a story ditto may be spared there which will be wanted here."
1897,3,259,William Gabb,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,10/05/1698,Fort,RAC,"Your Worshipps received of the 7th instant, with the things therein mentioned, all but the barrels powder and long ladder from Commenda, which desire your Worshipps will please to order by the sloope. I gave the 12 perpetuanoes and sheep to the King &ca, and told em all you was pleased to order. They continue still they will stand fast to the English, and assist as before promised, but here are severall tempered persons, and I perceive the Dutch employ all the instruments they can to obstruct us and infuse ill and absurd notions in the King and peoples heads, so that yesterday wee had some crabbed palavery, and they did insist that your Worshipps would not doe what you promised &ca, and because the powder, shott and great gunns was not come they was very uneasie, but I by Cabbosheer Quo told them the gunns was fixing and would be here in a few dayes with powder and shott &ca. They was earnest for it, and that they might have some powder to be ready and I to have a store by me to supply em if the enemie come upon em. They say the Generall of the Mina have sent powder to the Antas to fight em here, and all they feare is they will come upon em when they are unprovided with powder and shott, and soe be oblidged to quitt this place, and urge that when the gunns are mounted at the Castle twill put a dread on the enemie, that they will not come near us. They desire more people here to work to hasten the finishing the Castle. I engaged my life to em that your Worshipps will assist em with all things necessary to carry on the building and be kind to them if the[y] fulfill all they have promised &ca. This morning all was very serene and all at work, and tomorrow will goe about our out fortification. I will lay out part this day and cleare to goe to worke. I humbly desire your Worshipps will please to tell me which way you like best for the inner fort, then Ile lay out that, which when tis done can the better contrive the outward, because of roome, and to make as little work as possible. Just now the King told me they desire powder and gunns by a canoe if the sloope was not neare. I have endeavoured to perswade em the canoes could not bring the gunns, but they will not be well sattisfied till they come. The canoe men say they did not see a barrell powder. Worthy Sirs, here is a great expence of liquors, the King and people desireing some every day, that I have spent one cask and one third of the other.
I would with all my soul doe what your Worshipps please to order, and would not willingly doe any thing to deserve blame, therefore humbly desire your Worshipps directions.
PS. The King desires you will send one woman hither, her name is Amquamboe, her husband dyed about a twelve month agoe in the Castle. If your Worshipps please to order two Black bricklayers more from Commenda wee could be prepareing earth for bricks and some lay the outside of our earth walls. Pray please to send some flints, one worme for our small armes, and two cattouch boxes. Please to order the smith to make us three or four stone hammers and as many trowells, with ferrills [= ferrules] to em about inch and _ diameter within and some three inches, and three inch and a halfe bradds, [which] wee want to make a door and lock to itt."
1898,3,260,William Gabb,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,23/05/1698,Fort,RAC,"Your Worshipps of the 27th [sic] instant received with the things therein mentioned. The sloop and Gaily arived here the 21, and acording to your Worshipps orders sent the Gaily to Dikes Cove the same day, and wrote to Mr Vincent for bricks and timber, which wee much want. The currant setts so strong that she is nott two leagues off us. Wee gott all the gunns to the Castle this day, butt cannot mount them till tomorrow. I will hasten the unloading the sloope. The Captain desires the gunn wee found here, and would leave a bigger for itt, because the least is more convenient for him, if your Worshipps please itt shall be done. Last night one from the Mina told the King the Generall had ordered Little Taggee to send his people to Buttrue to help Jenum the Antar to fight the Doomes, and must take the English Castle againe. They say the Dutch shipp that sailed by here the 22d was loaded with them. They all came for powder and would not be denyed, for they had none to fight with. Addicoe said your Worshipps was pleased to tell him I must give the King and people some when they want itt, so I gave them four minion cartridges full. I would have sold some to them, butt they would nott then buy. The King swore all the Cabbosheers to stand true to the English, and would give your Worships eight marks of gold if he runn from the enemie as long as he live. If the enemie come upon us, I'le bee in as good order as possible to receive him, and if your Worshipps please to give the King orders and me leave to assist him, wee'l remove that unplaceable [= implacable] enemie the Dutch from Succondee, and Ile be cutt in peices before I'le surrender the Royall Companyes fort to them. The people here have been part imployed in building their houses, here not being above tenn when I first came here, and now is one hundred and forty. Some have work'd, and now they say will send all the strength they have. Wee are about the earth walls, and as soone as possible wee'l at the bricks, and doe assure your Worshipps [I] will to the utmost of my power hasten the building, and obey all your Worshipps orders. This day our three two hand canoes goes out to fish, butt are nott returned. Cabbosheer Quo tells me they was affraid of this pallaver, and they have been disattisfied because I did nott give them canky money every day. I paid them all to the 11th instant, but wrote to Mr Homma to know if must pay them, he gave me no answer and I was doubtfull your Worshipps would nott allow. I desire your Worshipps will please to send some [canoes?] here, the King being uneasie about their goeing away. Pray be pleased to send the things mentioned by the first.
PS. Pray send one powder home for that is nott come [which] was sent; bolts for the three carryages, vizt four 13_ inches to the eye, four 9 inches, two 15 and two 10 inches, the smith had the length; the old carryage that is at the work house, or bolts to the carryage of the gunn wee have here; 16 lines pins [= linchpins]; a worme and ladles for the great gunns; some English and country match; a sheepe skinn and some spung nailes; one worme for small armes; 2 or 3 musquetts; one hour glass; 3 cattouch boxes; six iron shovells; three stone hammers; iron work for the grindstone; one large pair of hooks and hinges; 3 ordinary ditto; 2 padlocks and staples; 2 bolts and six staples, crook neck't; two or 3 hundred 3 inch and 3 inch_ brads; _ hundred smallest spikes; one ball strong twine; one rabbett plaine [= rabbit plane] the Captain forgott; 1 pair stilliards; one buckett and rope to draw water; one dozen more crows, better made, these are not well groved; the moulds for bricks; some minion shott, here being none butt low minion and faulcon.

1899,3,261,William Gabb,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,27/05/1698,Fort,RAC,"This comes humbly to acquaint your Worshipps thatt since my last of the 23d instant, I see the pallaver is true that Little Taggee and Anters will fight us, which I did nott att first beleive, butt last night Little Taggee came in the bushes about halfe a league from us, and sent a lying pallaver to deceive the King and people, butt I used such arguments that prevailed with the King and people to look well out, which I did att the Castle. Wednesday morning a Dutch shipp came in this road, and is still here. This morning at daylight came about 20 two hand canoes, wee hear from the Mina, with four men armed in each, which posted to the Dutch Castle, where is all their towns people in armes. Our King has been ill three dayes, this morning some carryed him to a croome about halfe a league from us. The King and Cabbosheers was earnest with me to goe aboard the sloope, when they went away and left me butt one Cabbosheer and three men. butt when saw my resolution nott to leave the Royall Company's fort, the King sent me three or four Capposheers with about 50 men. The[y] promised me to stand by us, and with Gods assistance [I] will to the utmost of my power maintaine the Royall Companys rites [= rights], and doe nott designe to quitt the Castle. I most humbly desire your Worships will consider us and please to direct.
PS. The King and people say they will fight the enemies. Yesterday the Cabbosheers had a barrell of powder. They were in a hurry butt promised to pay me this day. Wee have butt little corne and cannott now gett any, pray please to send us some. Our four gunns are loaded but one has noe carryage. The Gaily cannot gett from hence, I have sent to her to hall [= haul] neer in to assist us. Please to send a ladle for our gunns, some cartridge paper, needles and thread, rammer heads and brass wyer [= wire]. I wish wee had more people to be revenged."
1900,3,262,William Gabb,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,30/05/1698,Fort,RAC,"Your Worshipps of the 26 & 29th instant have received with the things therein mentioned. I thank God our enemie have nott yett attacked, tho' all continue att the Dutch Castle as in my last. The shipp likewise, and shee have sent near 20 white men and a great quantity of small armes to thatt Castle. Little Taggee marched back towards Shuma, but I hear is come this way againe. The King returned hither a Satterday, but brought butt a few men, and part I doubt are roagues. Sonday morning part of the women and some men went away, and others is at hott dispute, some complaining they had sent for their men and none came and was nott able to fight the enemie, some for goeing presently away. I sent Quo to reason with them butt to noe purpose. I went among them, they told me their people had nothing to eat, and they wanted the four bendye, if had nott would nott tarry. I used all possible arguments till my soule was weary. Att last I must lett them have one bendy or nothing to be done, which I did unwillingly doe and did not leave my selfe halfe an ounce. This day about twelve or fourteen more went, they say to call more from the croomes. I continually urge them to call their people in a body, for now was the time to gaine the favour of your Worshipps. They always promise well but doe nott performe accordingly. This day the King must have two sheets for the fetish, or else the Castle would be taken, which I gave them. Your Worshipps being pleased to order recruits to us, doe mightily annimate my spiritts. I hope they will stand true, and I fear none of them, but hope to putt things in better order among us here. I have nott spared to labour day and night with head and hands to gett all things in readiness, and the best order as possible could, and doe keep a strict watch in the night, and will to the utmost of my power doe all I can for my masters intrest.
PS. Will take care to give your Worshipps a just accompt how all things sent are expended. The King desire the two gunns at Dickes Cove to be sent here, and the 3 women thatt came from thence. Addico told me just now that some of them was saying if the 3 women was nott sent here they could not have any thing to doe with the English. Have sent Addicoe that your Worships may please to examine him. I find some are roagues butt cannott find who is the cheifest. They desire your Worships will ask the Generall of the Mina why he sent Little Taggee to trouble them, and another thing they would have me write to trouble you, as Addicoe heard, they desire the money mentioned. I long to see the recruits before wee are sett upon. Please to send some more small shott; the King and people had part what I had. They have nott yett paid for the barrell powder, Quo tells me they hope your Worshipps will give itt them. Pray please to send some canoes. Please to send me a little paper, having none to write."
1901,3,263,William Ronan,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,30/11/1691,Fort,RAC,"The Cabbosheers and Quifferars are well affected, but John Cabesse, being now a creature of the Dutch, will not suffer us so much as to make a negroe house untill he has sattisfaction for 8 bendys & _ he sayes Mr Elwes owes him. After I put up the flagg he sent his people to take it down. I sent yesterday morning expressly to Great Tagge, but is not as yet returned. The Dutch coopman sayes that he has orders from the Generall not to suffer the English to bring any great gunns here. If Great Tagge will not stand by us the Royall Company will loose their interest here, so that you must send to him immediatly, as also endeavour to appease John Cabess. I am forced to take my habitation within our bare walls, and John Cabess threatens to turne us out. I will keepe the great canoe till I heare further. Just now I received a message from Little Tagee, thinking we had been all setled, I returned him to his master to send him to Great Tagee. Without appeaseing John Cabess am afraid nothing will be done. Just now arrived the express from Great Tagge saying he will be here tomorrow, and ordering me to advise you to writte to the Generall of the Mina in order to send for himself, that he may be sattisfied that we are all in amity and friendshipp, likewise to let him know how much you will allow him per month ground rent, & he will come downe himself and see the Castle finished. You may take notice that they are afraid to owne us till we are in a capacity to protect them. Our house does not want so much but it may be soone in a condition to argue our priveledges with the Dutch. Severall of the Quiffers has been here this day. All sorts of English goods will sell here if we had a place to secure them. They are all for finishing the house immediatly. I am just now agoeing to meet another messenger from Great Tagge about two miles of, he being afraid to be seen by the Dutch. John Cabess is verry abusive, and beat some of the canoemen."
1902,3,264,William Ronan,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,30/11/1691,Fort,RAC,"This accompanies the 13 hand canoe with Luke Gale the carpinter, who can tell you what is wanting. John Cabess begins to change, and will be sattisfied to have his sallary as formerly, with a promise to be true & faithfull to the English, if you come to some agreament about his last demands. He and Great Tagge hangs upon a string, so that if he [= John Cabess] is sattisfied wee shall have no opposition. Great Tagge desires that what has been and will be given him may be kept secret. They are all slaves to the Dutch & want only a protection to free themselves. He will doe what he can possible for his ground rent, desiring to know what you will allow him monthly. When I see him shall show him the former contract."
1903,3,265,William Ronan,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,02/12/1691,Fort,RAC,"Just now Great Tagge surrounded us with his armed men & demanded satisfaction for the following particulars, vizt for 64_ bendies with 22 slaves he spent in the last Fetue warrs, of which he sayes that Mr Humfryes has 22 slaves & 20_ bendys of gold. Also he demands the following pawnes left with Mr Samuel Humfryes, Mr Rice Wight & Mr Boy[l]ston, of which Mr Wight & Mr Elwes knowe verry well, vizt three golden manelloes [= manillas], one sword with golden handle & one string of broad fetishes, & sayes farther that if you will have any setlement here you must secure the following persons in Cabo Corsoe Castle, vizt Baniacon, Aminta, Ahenaco, Ahencoco & Hansaby. They must have your ansewer before they will let us part this place, soe humbly desire you will consider the danger I am in. Send your speedy answer this night or early in the morning.

1904,3,266,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,30/11/1694,Fort,RAC,"These are to acquainte your worships that this mor[n]ing about five clock where [= were] arrived att Commenda and according to your worships orders I whent [= went] derectly to John Cabbess croom, where wee where kindly [received] by him and his people. He understanding that there was a Ducth interloper lying about Cabo Corso Castle, hath desiered me to acquai[n]te your worship that he hath sent seven ounces to buy armes, which he pretends is to secure us and him selfe from the Ducth, whome he doth protest never to be friends with them againe. Further he doth desier powder & shott from your worships and a flagg to hoist, and is desierious to have the old Castle built and more and is much importuning to goe to see our Castle, he goeing with me and his people promising no damage shall attend me, which I will not doe without your Worships further orders. Tagge is up in the countrey, he [= John Cabess] hath sent for him and wee expect him about twelve a clock."
1905,3,267,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,01/12/1694,Fort,RAC,"This morning the messingers came back from Tagge, who sent for his foure _ cases of spierritts, and boath he and John Cabess desier your worships to send slaves to build a house by our Castle to dwell in and bricklayers to [go] on with [ms 'wt'] the Castle, and would have them to land at our usuall landing place, at Great Commenda, they promising no injury to be offered to them, they haveing sent souldiers in to Great Commenda to secure them. As for the Ducth I have never heard from them nor seen them. They would desier your worships to send the slaves as soone as possible you can. On Munday Ile send some people to ransace [= ransack] about our Castle.
[PS] John Cabess would have your worships to send a great cannoe with the slaves and a 2 hand ditto with her, the great cannoe to goe to Great Commenda and there bring to a[n] ancor, the two hand canoe to come on shoore att his croome and to give him an accompt of her arrivall."
1906,3,268,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,02/12/1694,Fort,RAC,"The people are very urgent to have the slaves come presently. The King hath sent downe to John Cabbes to send to your Worships for the great cannoe with 20 or 30 slaves and if you can spare some bricklayers. This day will come down from the King two hundred bricklayers, I say souldiers, that the Caposheers of Commenda Towne hath sent to John Cabbess, and desier that your people may come presently to worke. John Cabbess thinks itt noe good palaver because the slaves do not come, all are very desierous. I had noe matter to trouble your worships with, the substance of which I wrote before, but John Cabbess will not let me alone writting further, he doth desire the canno may come away as this night."
1907,3,269,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,04/12/1694,Fort,RAC,"This is to give your Worships an accompt that on the 3th instant I received your letter, and the same day about five in the afternoon John Cabbess and your Worships boys and a small parcell of his people went over the salt ponds to a littell house where the Ducth keep a small guard where they digg for gold, as the Blacks say, and about seven a clock they came back and brought with them five Duchmen, one of them being a Copeman, the other foure soulders, the Copeman and one of the soulders stark naked, the other[s] had shirts on [ms. 'one'] and draws [= drawers], but I doe not hear that they did hurt anyboydy as I can understand, and with them all the plunder of that place, as cheast [= chests], bundles, armes, sheep, goate &ca. This mor[n]ing the Blacks are bringing all there goods over from Commenda. John Cabbess will have me over to his croome which he lately burnt, where he and all will reside not more, butt I referr your Worships to Quomminna who brings the letter, who will give your Worshipps a further accompt."
1908,3,270,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,05/12/1694,Fort,RAC,"These are to acquainte your Worship that I recevied your letter being dated the 4 instant with a flagg and the slaves. John Cabbess grumbles there comes noe rumm nor powder, and ask if you think all these men doe not deserve drams. As for the powder he [is] not so hasty, for I see to the valew of 12 or 15 barrels which he purchased from the Brandenbourg, and doubtless there must be a time to make him restitution. Your worships in your last letter dated the 3rd instant would be advised what wood or water or landing place is neer or about the croome, the which I cannot, by reason I am not at that croome your worships may thinke I be. After wee landed at Commenda, being to windward of the town and Castle, wee carried our cannos over the sands and la[u]ncht in to a large salt pond, where wee ther[e] padled up about a mile and a _ to a croome of John Cabbess, where there is nothing but a parcell of houses where they make salte, a remorse [= remote] place some distance from the seaside, so that you can neaither see the sea, Castle [nor] Commenda Town. Yams, wine &ca are carried to and fro in cannos in the salte pond from croom to croome, haveing severall croms. The croome as your worshipps means I should reside at is the croome to which I am now goeing, which is situated by the seaside, by Commenda Towne, the Royal Companys old Forte, and by the Ducth likewise, at which croome wee must build the house, hoyst the Flagg att the Royal Companies old Castle, where when I come shall give your worships a further accompt. John Cabbess have some tragedom [= stratagem] in [h]is head, he often laughing and telling me he hath another trick to play, I know his meani[n]g by his mumping, but I beleeve he will be decevied, therefore [fore]warned fore harmed [= armed]. This croome we are a goeing to is all burnt down but 3 houses, John Cabbess burnt it when he had the first palaver with the Ducth.
PS. Your worships have one Peter in irons which John Cabbess and all the Cabbosheers would have owt, all the country being for the English. Captain Peter will tell you the palaver, for there is such a tumult and noyse that noe mortiall [= mortal] can write before wee have a house and [are] a little settled."
1909,3,271,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,06/12/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours I recevied this mor[n]ing by Quamana, with the two pieces of sattine and powder. For your boys to see the Ducth, I am alltogeather ignorant of itt, for I know [= knew] not weather [= whither] they where agoeing nor what about, tell at night the Duchtmen came into the sheed where I was smooking by a littell fier, for John Cabbess had told he had an English Brinney and they should see sum [= some] when they goe to his croome. For me to rule your Worshipps boys or the people hear is a thing imposible, for they are like soe many wild beast lett loose. Hear I live in a noisty [ = nasty] smooking hole, where I can neither lye, stand nor goe in it, and allwayes a tumultus noyse about my eares, and would I allow myselfe an ounce a day I could not injoy myselfe with it, I wish [ms.

As for John Cabbess croomes your worships boys tell me they are all his, so that I know not what croome to keep att.
Yesterday being 5 instant I came downe to another of John Cabbesss croomes which is the croome as I suppos[e] your worshipps meane, where when I came in sight of the Ducth Castell I saw they had made a wiff [= waif] with theire flagg and a boote [= boat] came from the shipp that lyes theire, the Castle gate shutt up, the people in armes up apon the battlements, John Cabbess and King[s] people of the towne all in armes skulkin[g] up and down the bushes and town about the Castle wishing for muskett & shott, vowing if the Ducth fierd a shot they would take them.
The Ducth sent to John Cabbess four severall times to make up the palaver, John Cabbess demands one hundred bendys. The boate came not on shoore butt whent on board againe, and how the business stands I know not.
This mor[n]ing being the 6 instant the Ducth fierd three shott att the Royal Companeys Castle, the first over the other two att the slaves as they where rowsawing. John Cabbess sent to know what made them fier, they said that the English should not live theire, John Cabbess said they should, the Ducth sayd they will fiet [= fight] him, and John Cabbess says he will fiet them.
[PS] They are continually att me for rumm, John Cabbess saith he drinks none butt [it is] for the people."

Yesterday arrived hear another Ducth shipp wherin they tell me is the General of the Mina. They did attempt to come on shore in the long boote and great canno, butt are not permitted. John Cabbess keep such strickt wacth night and day and suffers no letter to go on board and on shoore. John Cabbess would desier you to send him provitsions, as beef, hear being extrodinary scarce by reason noe people come downe butt souldiers nor no canno men go of afishing, but all beare armes. For my parte I have eate nothing but roisted [= roasted] yamms this three days, unless it where three small eonions, but I have sent to Forte Royle [= Royal] for provissions.
[PS] Hear is never a flag stove [= stave] to be gott, so have not hoysted the flag, nor no wood to build Fort. Hear is a spring of water very neer."

The General is not gon as yet nor Tage. Heer are two great Ducth ships ryding. The briganteen is gon to windward. Hear is a discourse with the blacks that the Ducth have abdicated their Forte at Succondee and gon to Shumma, and that the Adoomes people have taken all their gunns owt &c.

Theire was _ a case of spirrits of Captain Amos I had in keeping, which John Cabess would make me give the King, and likewise hoiste the flagg, and give the King three gunns, which I did.

On the 17th Captain Amo whent with them to the King of aQuaffoe and as yett is not returne[d], and on the native [= one of the natives] reflects on us [ms.

The carpenter saith that the girders are all fitted att Cabo Corso for the lower woorke and [there will] be nothing done in bricklayers woorke till such time as is lade. Wee had from on board Capt. William Piles 7 good gorders [= girders] and severall joyces, timber enough for the upper woorke. If your worships would be pleased to send us halfe a hundred of men slaves wee might be getting of stone against the bricklayer come up with crows and pikaxes for that purpose. Newby the carpenter promised to speek to your worshipps for severall things, as slett [= slit] dale which would serve for the dwelling house for doors and windows and save the whole deale, instead of that hee hath carried away all the tooles with him in pretence of gitting them mended and grounded, soe that the carpenter heeare hath no tooles hardly to woorke with. Your worship please to send him downe againe, or some other carpenter to help this. Wee want a grindstone very much. John Brithoway is runn away to Cabo Corso Castle, as I think he swore he would goe home in these shipps, and that he would not woorke, and did not while he was here, what woorke was done the black bricklayer did. John Cabbess hath left a pawne with Capt. Roberts wheaing [= weighing] tenn bendyes for the valew of 9 bendyes less one angle six taccoes in gold.

The dwelling house is [ms.

The great hinges that where designed for the fort gate are putt on the yard gate, and one pair to the hall door in the forte. The deales are all gon except about halfe scor[e] which [are] nott good enough to make the forte gate, the carpenter saith. As for Amo, is still at Great Commenda with the King waiting for answer from the Densarces and Qurs, to whome they have sent the goods, as they [= the latter?] are down here, a parcell of them, every Friday, I say Tuesday, and would b[u]y goods, they tell me now the Quafferoe people and wee all one. As for the Ducth I cannot descover nothing, butt of old I know them to be circunventing [= circumventing] people and would fained have us of againe, to which purpose have sent money to the Dansers and Quaffoe Twies [sic: = Quafferoes], if your worships are better informed then I can informe you. Before wee can gitt stone your worships may send up some crows and a great sieged [= sledge] hammer [and] wedges, and then we have but a parsell of puni slaves and shall make no great hand of itt. The carpenter would desier your worships to send up some whol deales and slats and iron hindges, a broad chiswell and a littell saw, 3 quarter augors and a great plum[b] iron and grindstone, without which he cannot proceed."

He hath not bin wel never since he hath bin hear, but very weake and faint, soe now wee have never a tradesman heare. The slaves are imployed according to order in gitting stone togeather.
[PS] Mr Searle will do well to bring some tables downe with him, for wee have never a table here. The carpenter was about the table when taken sick."
1924,3,286,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,08/02/1695,Fort,RAC,"This morning about six a cloack I arrived here and was received per John Cabbess and the Cabbosheers of the place & made verry welcome per them, particularly John Cabess. So soon as I was ashore I dispatched a messenger to the King of Aquafoe to acquaint him of my arrivall, who sent downe his people to bid me welcome and verry earnestly requested workeman to goe on with the Forte, which he expected I had b[r]ought with me, and understanding to the contrary, said that if the Dutch had halfe the palaveras they would have had guns upon their fort ere this tyme, and that I should dispatch a canoe purposely to acquaint you that he is verry earnest to have us fortifie our selves, that we may be in defence against all the friends of the Dutch. John Cabess and the rest of the Cabbosheers were verry earnest with me on the same account, and that they will assist you with stones or any thing they can, and as I understand by them they are doubtfull of the Quiferas, the Dutch endeavouring to bring them downe to turne us out. I question not, if you can suply us with men and materialls, but before the rains to raise the fort of defence against any Negroes that shall asault us. If in very few days we have not workman the natives will be verry much disatisfied, and those that would be our friends may be forced to fayle us for fear of the Dutch. The timber for the lower floor I understand you have ready framed, and for the upper floor I beleive here is almost suficeint here, which if this [is] raised would stop the mouthes of the Blacks, we could better fortifie our selfes, and I hope tomorrow night or a Munday morning you will send men and materialls, that we may not slip any opportunity, for all the people are verry much disatisfied that I did not bring workmen with me. I have sent a broken maul and desire three maulls, two crewes [= crows], two pick axes, for the breaking of stone. Alsoe I have sent a man slave which has been blind a long time, and I humble desire more slaves, lusty men for the breaking of stone, and the free people will bring them [i.e. stones] to the fort, I supose for some small dashes, but as yet have made no [ms. 'ne'] palavra with them. I desire a table, a cott and a great chest which is in the possession of Mr Salmon by first canoe, of which I stand in great need of, here being only row [= raw] walls, the slaves haveing nothing to doe for want of mawles to break stone. John Cabess did as good as tell me yesterday that if did loose possession again it was our owne faulte, and that we could never have the licke opportunity. He says all the Blacks say it is he that has brought the Englisch hither, and it has cost him abundance of money and it will be a continuall charge to him till the fort is upp, the meantime he has noe place to fly to for protection, [and that the] Dutch are continualy offering him dashes and lickewisse the same to Great Taggee to turn us out. The Dutch I understand has a great trade and most of the people which live with them, could we protect them, would come and build under our fort. Here is not a lock to a dorre [= door] or any else, I desire if you have any to send two, if not I desire the armorer may macke them. John Cabess is verry desireous to have some blew perpetuanoes, and if you have any I desire you will send what you can, as alsoe some sheets (if you think convenient). John Cabess says he will live and dye with us, but he hath been in the Dutch fort since this falling out and I believe the Dutch will spare noe cost to gett him of their side, soe that we had best make use of the opportunity we have, for he tells me him selfe they have offerd him whatever he demands to turn us out. I find by him he is not disatisfied at nothing more than at our being so backward to bouild, that we may be able to protect him, which with my respects humbly thanking for placeing me here."
1925,3,287,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,12/02/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date per the 11 hand canoe I have received with one garder [= girder] & twinty six jeyces [= joists] peices, and will make the best use of the workman you have sent as I can till you can spare more. We are in want of lime, which I desire may be sent as soone as canoe returnes, for the briklayers tell me that the old morter which is here will be of noe service, however it shall be used in the midle of the wall. This night came to an ancker in this roade an English interloper, John Samson Commander, from Londen. I shall be very carefull to learn what I can of the palavras of the countrey, and advise you upon all occasions. I desire sheets, knives, iron barrs, English carpets and powder if you can spare any as soon as the armourer has made the locks, & till then I cannot with safety secure anything. The people has been with me for their custome of settling a Chiefe, I told them that when I had goods they should have them and they are verry well contented, so desire to be advised what the custom is by next canoe.
PS. There is a Brigantine from New England ladened with provisions &ca att an anchor about Axim."
1926,3,288,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,13/02/1695,Fort,RAC,"I trouble you with this, being perfectly forced to it by the Cabbosheers of Commanda about their customs, who were verry insolent with me this morning about them and told me they alwaies used to be paid after a Chiefe came, their demands is to the vallue of 4 says & a halfe & two anchors liquors. My answer was that I was unacquainted with it, but to satisfie them I would send to you for goods, & as soon as I had them they should have their usuall customs. Above mentioned goods part of it is for the King & Fetera of Aguaffo. We are in want of boards for scafolding and old [ones] for the same use."
1927,3,289,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,14/02/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date I have received with the perticulars therein mentioned. I am still in want of one say, for the[y] demand _ a say for one Captain Newna more then what they told me of yesterday Had I had goods here I would have given them twice as much rather then have had the trouble with them as I had this morning, besides the continuall charges I am & expect to be att till the fort is up. So soon as the canoe arrives I desire her loadened with bricks to carry up the corners of the wall with the boards, ladder and two walling hamers formerly desired. The Dutch has paniard Captain Abran and Shimbee of the Mina about our settling here, which much troubles Taggee & John Cabess. This morning came ashore the Gunner of Cormantine to be their Gunner here, & their fort is extrodinary well man'd. What they intend I know not, but I keep John Cabess out of their way as much as I can, for if we loose him our intrest here is all lost. I have continually messengers from Taggee pressing me to send for workman.


for he says the Dutch will never leave till they see us so well fortified that they cannot pretend to drive us out, & John Cabess says it has cost him above 150 bendis. If you please to send for the bricklayers that are att Dickies Cove and let me have a few more slaves, this would goe briskly on till you can spare the rest."
1928,3,290,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,16/02/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date I received with the bricks sent per the great canoe, by her I have returned all the empty casks you sent the lime in. It will be impossible for us to be supplyed with lyme, bricks, and all other necessaryes in canoes. If you please to order Capt. Piles up loaded with shells, will macke us a good stock of lyme, and either load him up with bricks or send men hither that can burn us a kill. John Cabess and the rest of the people is verry desireous to have Harry the Bomboy, because he was here and knowes where to gett stone & everything without breaking their fetiches. We are in want of boards for scafolding & twenty joyce peices. The joyce of the roome is laid and two flanckers, & the garder is ready for the other, only stayes for joyce. We cannot shift without more slaves, & I desire to know what agreement I shall make with the people to bring stone, which I suppose you have mentioned in the agreement with the king of Aguaffo. Alsoe I desire a short ladder which Basjohn [= Bastian] says is ready made & purposely for the place, & ropes. Yesterday came to anchor here two Dutch Company ships, one from the Mina & the other from Shuma. They are hail'd in verry near the shore, which made John Cabess in a very great rage. I could not keep him from going to the Dutch fort to tell the Cheife if any men came ashore he would kill'd them, which he did under the walls att 10 a cloack att night, though I told him they might shoot him if he [ms. 'be'] ventured in that manner. The Chiefe told him the ships should ride here four dayes, in this manner the Dutch did when they panyard the Commenda people before, & the Blacks are afraid that the Dutch now expect some people, either Quiferas or others, downe upon them to serve them so againe, but certainly they have some designe more then ordinary, which I hope they will neaver bring to pass, but I plainly see that wee shall neaver be att quiet nor free from expence till we are able to defend ourselves, & then I doubt not but here will be a trade to answer the charge. I desire a piece of lead to putt to the bricklayers plume [= plumb] rules, and the joyce & the necessaryes desired a Munday.
PS. Basjohn tells me that either of the black carpenters will give him more assistance than this old man."
1929,3,291,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,17/02/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours I have just now received, & have send your boy to the king. This beleive the Dutch expect, & wee mus.0.t expect if we do not go on further in our work to be beaten out. I will engage, if you pleasse to send all the worckmen you have and good store of slaves & necessaryes, in twenty days to defend ourselves against all the Blacks the Dutch can raise, and it is hard if we cannot raise friends to keep them of so long. The King of Aguaffo had just send his Che to call his men together, & we hear that the Quiferas is lickewise expected, but I am certain we cannot be long protected if we do not protect ourselves, so humbly desire that so soon as this comes to your hands that you will do as desire.
PS. I desire good planck to macke a gate & 3 verry st[r]ong hinges for the door, with hooks, bars & staples, & amp; provisions & men, & we will not soe easily be driven as they may expect."
1930,3,292,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,18/02/1695,Fort,RAC,"This comes as from John Cabess purposely for Captain Amo, and if he be not well a trusty friend in his roome this night without fayle, and he will endeavour to spoile the Dutch designes, and if we can now prevent them, and you answer my yesterdays request, they may do their utmost afterwards. I desire as many black soldiers as you can raise with ammunition [ms. 'annumition'] for them. I have noe powder, what is here is in the hands of John Cabess, and he tells me there is two barrels. As soon as I can I will secure the powder roome, and then will have itt from him. The Dutch designes is verry disperate [= desperate], for this morning the Copeman told John Cabess that before the ships sailed they would have Taggees head, and if he [= Cabess] would be their friends, they would pay him all expence.
PS. If you have not great canoes to bring slaves, tradesman & all pray sent [= send] 2 hands [i.e. 2 hand canoes], that there may be noe delayes."
1931,3,293,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,18/02/1695,Fort,RAC,"Your messanger is just come from the king of Aguaffo, he says he expect the Quiferas & Cabestera people in 8 days to fight him. His request is that you will send him ten bendyes in powder and thirty bendyes in goods to carry on the warr, and that with all the speed as is possible that we raise the fort. I am afraid the Dutch expect them much sooner, and beleive they will stick at nothing to gett us out. His messenger goes in the canoe. The great canoe is just arrived & I have received the things sent by her. Here is hoocks & hinges &ca enough, but none fitt for the gate of a fort, but for slight dores, therfore I desire three larg[e] hinges, 3 ditto hoockes for wooden barrs. You advise you are in hopes the Quiferas will doe us no harme, but you may be assured that they will be with the Commenda people sudenly and that the King of Commenda is not able to resist them, as far as I can learne, so that if they come we must rely upon their mercyes, for we cannot pretend to defend our selves in the condition we are in. If I had the worckmen I would strike all these houses & lay in the fort, & run up a spur for the present with swish and stone, & when we are secure strike it againe & bring the guns in to the fort and plant them out at the lower window, so that with John Cabesses people & our owne we may defend ourselves, if we should have occasion. I doubt not if I had all the workmen but in twenty dayes to have two flankers upp. I can if I have slaves gett wood, or I can hire free people to fetch it. The slaves I have will not keep these men I have at worck, soe pray let me have more men slaves. You give me noe orders what I shall doe about the free people bringing stone, therefore can make noe palavera with them. Here is noe timber fitt for joyce, and not joyce enough for the upper floor, so desire you will have joyce sawed for us. Basjohn says there is two peices of timber by the water side is fitt for nothing else, and if you will send sawers & a saw I will saw what timbers here is, except three for the top, and will not be enough by at least thirty peices. I humbly desire that if any possibility of spareing the worckman that you will send them, & I hope all will be to your content. If not I fear that when the enemy approaches that John Cabess will shift for him selfe, for he told me yesterday that if I was not here he would go to some other country, and asked me if the English had but one canoe. I satisfied him the other was at Winneybah. He replyed that he had allmost spent what he had about the palavera, and at last must be forced to seek for protection. I promised him as fare [= fair] as I can, & tell him you will supply us with necessaryes as soon as possible. Here is but one crow, we should have four or six at least, and more mawls for the breaking stone. The canoe I returned as soon as she was unloaded, hoping to have her tomorrow with lyme, and when Capt. Piles comes I hope shall have his loading with shells & some bricks if he can take them in. Crows and mawls are much wanted.


PS. The bar for the gate four foot two inches.
I have heard nothing of the workmen from Dickies Cove."
1932,3,294,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,18/02/1695,Fort,RAC,"This comes expressly to advise you that between this & Thursday the Quiferas will certanly fight. We are in noe manner able to defend our selves, nor can I think of any protection here if Taggee be beaten. John Cabess came & advised me to send for canoes to fetch away our things. I desire Mr Salmon may be ordered to take care of what I sent downe. I will alwais give him account, and send them by little & a little, that it shall be perceived as little as can be. We proce[e]d in our worck, but if Taggee be beaten, which is expected by all, it is to noe purpose, soe if the great canoe be not come away with the worck- men I leave it to yourselves, and desire you will order what I shall do and what security I shall take to save what I can of the Company timber &ca here, which I fear will be hard if once we have lost the feild. I desire your immediate answer.
PS. If you send me ammunition &ca & your orders what I shall doe in the matter, nothing shall be wanted in me."
1933,3,295,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,20/02/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date I have received, and all the whitemen & slaves sent, and observe its contents, but the bussiness will be of a sudden. The Generall of the Mine is like the rest of his country men for fair promises & a false hart, but I hope to secure the Company possession against them. If Taggee be beaten, indeed I know not what shift we shall make for water, which will be the chiefe thing we shall want. We have but 3 musquets, noe small shott, but little match, noe granadies [= granadoes], which I desire with speed. Here is wood enough to be had to burn shells, but I desire lyme as fast as you can in the mean time. You write me I may keep the canoes, but they are not to be so commanded. I desire you will not pay one of the small canoes a cra cra, but besides make some of them an example, for it is a shame we should be serv'd so by them as follows. Last night I ordered them all to stay till the morning & the great canoe to take in John Cabesses women & begone in the night, & they stayed till day. I went to the water side myselfe, all the small canoes tooke in Comenda women before my face & one would not take a wife of John Cabesses, nor staye for a letter of mine, so you may judge if we are served so by our owne people what those will do for us that lives under the Dutch. They would take in nothing for me nor come ney [= nigh] the factory, and if any mis[c]hance happens I know not how I shall give you advise. We desire that what canoes you send you will order them to bring the canoes of[f] our side. I cannot get a canoe to carry this same, forced to send it after the great canoe. I understand Mr Bloome goes home. I am willing to stay here to see the ground of the designe & secure the place till the danger is past if possible, but if it be true I hope you will not dispose of Accra, but favour me with it. I have not been so ill these two yeares as I was last night, and all day yesterday, or I would have write you by the smith. At present am something better; pray pardon my fowle [= foul] writing at this present."
1934,3,296,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,21/02/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date I have received, with the particulars therein mentioned. We shall mount two guns today on one flancker & tomorrow the other two on another, to defend ourselves whilst we raise the other worck. The king of the Danckers, throw [= through] intrest Abon has made with him, thre[a]tens the Quiferas, which will delay them from coming so soon as the Dutch expect them, & the Quiferas has sent toe Taggee for elleaven bendis to drinck, which he has sent to macke a palavera, in which tyme I hope we shall be of more defence. If I hear the palavera is not to be made upp shall desire a canoe loade of water, pray let there be cask ready to be filled, for here is noe shift to be made for any here if we should be shutt upp. We have used almost all our boards to secure these flanckers & the gate, so desire what more you can spare, wee cannot doe any thing with less than fifty. Pray lett Capt. Piles take in what bricks he can to bring with the shells. If the canoe can bring any bricks with the boards pray let her, for they will be wanting. Wee want three walling hammers & two trowells. The seaven which have been here since we first took possession want their pay. I know not what their pay is or from what tyme they must be paid, & these which came last I know not what method to take to have them provided of, provision being verry scarce. These two days I have given them la a day to buy cankey, & soe I must doe till I receive your further orders, & that is verry short for working slaves in this place. Boards the surveyor say you have not enough to cover the fort when it is raised, therfore if you thinck convenient to send to Dickies Cove to have planck sawed would doe as well, & I hope we shall be soon ready for them. I shall forward it as much as is possible, & make as cheep agreement with the Commenda people to help me with stone as I can.
PS. The iron barr is to long, soe have sent him to be cutt to the length of four foot & one inch from outside to outside, & the hoocks will not bare [= bear] the gate, desire three elleaven inches long. 25 lb shott is as nothing, considering we have noe lead to macke more."
1935,3,297,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,23/02/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date with i[t]s particulars I have received. I shall sende the sawyers to Dickies Cove to saw planck. I desire a canoe of bricks. John Cabess desires twelve half barrills powder, & as many musquetts or snaphances. If he doe not fight he will pay for the powder, and restore the armes.
PS. John Cabess will not be contented without Harry the Bomboy."
1936,3,298,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,23/02/1695,Fort,RAC,"The Dutch have sent for Ante Ashrevy now they see [ms. 'soe'] the other will not answer their desires so soon as they expected, he is to pass Shuma Revier [= river] this night. John Cabess his people with more of Great Commenda people lay weight [= wait] for him, and [we] are all in what readiness we can be in to receive him. I have given John Cabess 4 of those musquets till you send his, & two barrills powder, so that you know how I am provided. I desire you will send his, as we may be furnished. The Dutch will neaver leave, therefore it will be convenient to have a canoe of water & a cask of bread more, which I humbly desire on sight hereof. We are somthing of better defence then we was. We want ca[r]tooch boxes, flints and a worme for our armes.
PS. I also desire ould junck & cartridge paper, and if we had more white soldiers it would do well."
1937,3,299,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,23/02/1695,Fort,RAC,"This comes by John Cabess desire, for what Black soldiers you can raise. Pray send an hour glass, as we may keep watch right.
PS. Pray lett them be served with powder & ball, & then they will have catoock [= cartouch] boxes, for the halfe of the twelfe that is here have none. If Blow desires they may come by land."
1938,3,300,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,24/02/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date with the perticulars to be sent the king I have received, they shall be sent him this night. I hope the Quiferas will not come downe at all, for the Dankaras has sent to Taggee &ca to send eighty bendyes and they will not lett the Quiferas come, so they will conclude to send them pawnes and when they have ajusted all palavera will pay them, this is what I hear, but they tell me that Ashrevy was at the Mine about six days since & has taken mony to come & turne us out, but he will not find it so easy as he may expect. Tomorrow we shall be of as good defence as we can be till we have raised the flanckers to their height with good morter, & good & dry lodging in the fort, & then we must have the smallest guns you can gett, for these will take our work downe. The Dutch is on some new designe. The Galley is gone directly to the Mine this day. you may have an eye there to see if she doe not take Mina people to carry to Shuma to assist Ante Ashrevy."
1939,3,301,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,25/02/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of this date per the great canoe with the particulers sent by her have received, except the hour glass. I desire she may be returned with bricks.
PS. Wee are in want of the three walling hammers & two trowells formerly desired."
1940,3,302,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,27/02/1695,Fort,RAC,"I send this to desire you that since the great canoe is not come today that you will be pleased to load her [ms. 'hear'] with lyme, as much as she can carry, & if you have any more great canoes that you will send them with lyme alsoe. What we have here will hardly keep the men at worck for this day, & the bricks will last some days longer. If you can supply us I hope to have a flancker up to its height the next weack and ready for four small guns, which I hope you will have reade [= ready] to send by that tyme. The Dutch Generall last night sent money by the canoes to Shuma to be sent to the king of the Danckeras, that he might not hinder the Quiferas coming down to turne the English out.
PS. Pray lett the walling hammers & trowells be sent, as also 2 or 3 pair of line irons."
1941,3,303,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,28/02/1695,Fort,RAC,"About sunsett came the Windhowns long boate ashore here, as the Black says with armed men. John Cabess with his soldiers went downe to the water syde, and as the Blacks say the whiteman fired first, but there is two whitemen kill'd, one head they have cutt off as they tell me, so that you may expect we shall have some sudden bussiness here. To trust the Blacks is hard, here is no comand to be kept over the soldiers you sent, they do us more harm in the fort then good, therefore on sight hereof I desire white soldiers, not such as the last, please to send but such as will do service. Tis the Mine people we may expect so sudenly. Tomorrow I will send all my lumber on board the Galley, that I may lay in the fort. Lett me have your imediate order what to doe.
PS. John Cabess [would] have the Black soldiers you sent to help him, he told me otherwise that he waild [= would] go to Commenda."
1942,3,304,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,01/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys the great canoe, which I send downe that with the other that they may immediately returne with lyme. Here is noe thought of burneing the shells here now, for this hinders all our worck. When I receive the lyme I will returne Capt. Piles and one of the canoes, that she may put the shells ashore with you and returne with lyme & bricks. The Windhown is hail'd in soe near that she may kill men of the shore with small arms, & the Galley is plying upp, she has fired three shott, one of which just over our fort, & the fort fired two shott, one in the see [= sea] and one in the towne. They have burned their towne & I suppose we shall in few hours see their designe. If we cannot defend ourselves I doubt we shall be in a bad condition, and we are really but of poor defence, seaverall of our men sick & others I beleive that never fired a gunn in their lives. I have pulled downe all the houses, so that now we lay all open to the dow [= dew] & raine. I desire a tent or something that may shulter [= shelter], or tarpollings [= tarpaulins] to cover the men, or we must all expect sickness, a chirurgeon will be necessary. The Windhown takes all canoes that passes. I hope before this tyme you have sent a good supply of bricks & men. & if the fort & ships doe not fire at us, I hope to deale well enough with the Mine Blacks if they come. You must not on any accompt lett us lack lyme, for delays will be very dangerous where the case is soe desperate. Wee expect assistance from Taggee but as yet the messanger is not returned. Pray send at least 100 lb shott, for these lead barrs will the best [ms. 'beast'] part be given away to the blacks. At tymes I have desired bandilears, wee have but three collers in the fort. Worms for the great gunns we have not one, we are bare of match, if you have not English pray send this country match. I have advised you what I can. If we canot defend our selves here is no way to escape the enemy, therfore we must not want any necessaries.
PS. The Cabbosheers desire two carpetts & one sheet to make a fetish. John Cabess is bare of powder, I cannot supply him. I have neither wax or wafers, therfore desire some. The glass you send is good for nothing, therfore desire others; if noe small ones, two hour glass will doe as well."
1943,3,305,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,02/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date I have received with the men sent per the great canoe. I was sending her aboard the Galley to fetch the shells ashore, but the shott flyes so thick that the canoe men will not goe, so have returned her, & ordered Capt. Piles to weigh & saile for Cabo Corso. The canoes I desire this night full of lyme & the necessaryes desired yesterday as they can come. We stand still for want of lyme, & then pray let the Galley come up with lyme & bricks & four small guns. The blacks began to fight the Dutch fort last night about 8 a cloack & plyed them verry thick till one of the morning. There is only two Blacks wounded.
what damaged the fort has received I know not. but they have made seaverall attempts to put more men from on board this morning but are kept of by the Negroes. Their Galley will be in the roade in an houre more, & then to be sure they will make some other attempt. Taggee has sent John Cabess a supply of men this morning, & I supose they will atack the fort in the evening. John Cabess had a barrell of powder of me yesterday, soe that I have but three barrells and he is still in want, as I wrote you yesterday. If supply[ed] with lyme this flancker will be up next weack.
PS. The men you send up says the Laiutenant told them they need take nothing with them, that there was provisions enough. I thought the provisions had been to have served when we had been shut up, but as they have nothing to live on I have given them part & I desire the Galley may bring more, for here is not a cankey to be had."
1944,3,306,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,03/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date per the great canoe with what sent per her have received. We must stay for lyme, we always putt more swish than lyme, that you have now sent will only serve tomorrow. If we had lyme we should raise the fort verry fast. I sent downe one of the carpenters yesterday, & he tells me he doe not see any timber fitting for the timbers of this flanckers when it is up. At Annamaboe there is severall peices fitt for nothing else, and will doe our bussiness very well. The Dutch last night came ashore with all their boaths [= boats], and by force landed their men just against the fort; they leaped out of their boates and gott up the rocks at least thirty whiteman & three Blacks which swam before to show them the way, & just now came ashore & landed many casck of provisions at the same place, the Blacks continually fireing at them but had not the hart to advance to hinder it, the shott flying verry thick from the Castle and ships, and boats. One of our women slave goeing down to fetch the lyme as they began to fire came a shot from the ships, broacke her crew all to peices in her hand. Severall shott from the Castle & ships has flew'd directly over our fort. Here is now a fresh talk of Quiferas coming this weak, but I hope they will be frustrated. Pray lett the canoes come both as soon as possible loaded with lyme, and Capt. Piles bring a good quantity, for the rains is at hand and here is not covering for the men. I have given John Cabess one barrell of powder you have now sent & keep the other two, so that I have five barrells & I cannot keep less. He is much disturbed to be so scarce of powder. He in the canoe send[s] a boy to desire two barrells more, which may be sent in the night per a 2 handed canoe. Just now is come advise that the Quiferas will fight Taggee suddenly. The blacks spend abundance of powder, & if they are not supplyed will be a means to make them fly. The 2 hand canoe I last sent you is not returned, I hear they are afraid to come, you sending your letter the other night per the great canoe, that if they come without a letter the Dutch will paniare them. They are my owne slaves, & I never send them but on such an occasion as the other night, when I canot get others, because I would have them to give you advice when there is nesessity. I desire you will have them found & send them away, for I shall get noe canoe here if anythings hapens. If you find they are rogues & wants to run away, pray secure them."
1945,3,307,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,04/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"This comes expressly to advise you that the Quiferas are certainly on their march. Taggee just now sent me word to be gone with all my people to Cabo Corso, for that he would goe out of his country the night, and he did not know what the Dutch would do, that they have hired the Quiferas to fight him, & the Anta people our Castle. Pray consider of this & order for the Galley immediately to come and sayle to windward of the Dutch, and six Cabo Corso canoes aboard to carry & send orders, as the Dutch do, and Capt. Piles to follow the signes I shall give him. and I will defend the fort to the utmost minute. If you give your orders we shall have upwards of sixty people & have not water and provitions for above eight days at most. We must have at least 2 months provitions and water, or wee must expect to deliver our selves into the hands of the enemy. If we have not a supply this night, I fear tomorrow will be to late. If they engage you must send people downe the country to make them raise their camp, or we shall be in a verry bad case. Thirty granadoe shells is nothing, the Dutch spend more in one night, and we have noe spare arms. Blunderbusses will be verry well, patereroes will lickwise doe us a kindness, but am afraid your supply will be to late, for they are certainly now designed on us, and the fair stor[i]es the Dutch tell you is of noe effect, & I thinck it will be convenient to send another messanger to the Mina, for perhaps they will think to have revenge on us for the men they had killed by the Negroes. They salley out and fight every hour. John Cabess I hear designes to leave me this night.
PS. I wish I had another man in the roome of John Browne, a mutinous raskall, he strocke [= struck] the Serjeant yesterday, and you are sensible what he was before, he may doe more harme theen good."
1946,3,308,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,06/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 4th & 5th instant by the great canoes with bricks & lyme I have received. John Cabess went from hence with all his people last night. & I received


another messenger from the King to tell me to begone to Cabo Corso, and when he had fought the Quiferas he would send for me [ms. 'my'] againe. I bid the messenger tell him that I wished him good success, but that I did not designe to leave the place, thincking it of defence against any bla[c]ks that should come against it, and that the Dutch dare not do any thing themselves. I desire the canoes may both be loaded this night to be here in the morning with lyme, and the flancker shall be upp in four days, and I hope the gunns are ready for us, which will disharten the blacks for coming against us. and disincourage the Dutch in their procedings. If we want lyme we shall not have a dry place by the rains, and no man can live long to lay as we all doe at present, severall already taken sick. We canot goe on with our building if I send downe the slaves, & I know not well what to doe with them here, whether we are beseiged or not, for here is nothing to be had for them to eate. The old slaves doth very well, but those which are Alampoes I fear I must be forced to send downe. I have advanced them one akey each to buy provitions, and paid the old slaves their four months pay, deducting 9ta each paid them by the serjeant, & the Alampoes complains already, so that if you can [send] ten good men Cambo [= Gambo] slaves or others I will send you them all downe. There have been four of them missing ever since yesterday morning, but the rest tells me that they are only gone to get provitions. If they are runn away I believe shall have them againe, but they canot shift here unless they have corne. I shall take care not to fire or molest any that doth not begin with us first, for if they keep us from water, as I see by yours you have not sent any, we canot withstand above six days at most, & as for storming us I fear them not. I shall be glad of Capt. Kecks company, but fear he will not so well like his habitation. Pray supply me with lyme by canoes for this flancker, and by that time I hope it will be better, & if so will send downe the Galley for a whole kelme [= kiln].
PS. I have sent downe twenty slaves, thirteen women and seven men. The Dutch sent to the watersyde & took a man of John Cabesses that was wounded going downe in the great canoe."
1947,3,309,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,07/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"Capt. Piles is now come to anchor in the roade. Tomorrow shall take ashore what you have sent except the powder, John Cabess and all the people being gone, soe that I have not any to supply. What I have is sufficient for the defence of the fort, & as much as our powder roome will hold. When I have occasion will send for [ms 'fort'] it, or he shall bring it you againe. We live now as if we were in the woods, nobody comes ney us nor I hear nothing of the country palaveras. Here is
not a man or woman left or a canoe to send you a letter, if never soe great occasion. This is the canoe you sent to carry the men ashore you have sent to the Adoomes. Cabo Corso canoes will be verry convenient to stay either aboard or ashore, for we shall not know of any thing the Dutch designe till it is come upon us. I should be verry glad to hear of the two canoemen I write you of the other day, who are still in the towne. I was in hopes to have had the canoes full of lyme this morning, what you sent was used yesterday & we have nothing today if we are not better supplyed. Men canot live here in the rains, if we are not molested before. Yesterday the Dutch toock a slave of the Companys out of our canoes, upon which I went to the water side my selfe & there I found a white sentinell & many blacks to overlook us, so I demanded his reason, and he told me it was his Copemans orders. I tould him he should not come nigh the canoes nor concerne himselfe with anything therein, if the Cheif had anything to say to me I would stay whilst he send to the Cheif, which he did and he came. So soone as his boy told him the slave was the Companys he turned him out of the Castle before him when he came. I asked him whither he had any order to molest me and paniare the Companys slaves, & that I had lost severall, one of which I found in his hands, and from him the rest would be expected, if they are not found elsewhere. Here is five still missing, & I beleive I shall never hear of them any more. He as good [as] told me him selfe that we should not live here long, and that what we lost we might write of it into England & there get satisfaction. Capt. Keck has given you his opinion of the fort, and if you designe to hold it by force we must have lyme to raise the worck out of hand. I hope Taggee will beate the Quiferas, that we might have John Cabess here, for after all the charges the Company have been at should verry unwillingly loose the possession."
1948,3,310,Lawrence Keck,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,07/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"I this day about 12 of the clock came ashore here, & have according to your worshipps commands taken a view of the house & fortifycations, which according to the best of my judgement. I think not tenable, if a body or army of men appeare before it, for the reasons following, & first we have here indeed 4 gunns mounted, but in case of a storme we canot expect to discharge them above once before the enemy will be under them, for they are too big for the place where they stand, & your Worshipps I presume know verry well that great bodys are not ma[na]geable in small places. 2dly [the] whole & best defence we can macke must be with our small armes, & whether a shot now & then made thro a loop hole, which may doubtless now & then occasion a man to fall, will be of force to putt a stop to their courages I know not, yet certain I am by the report
I have here heard, if the Dutch had been able to make noe better resistance John Cabess had unavoidably been master of their fort, which to ours is a Fort Royall, for they may stand upon one anothers shoulders & leap into ours, there being not one floar laide, noe not soe much as a place to lye drie in for the poor men. This is plainly my opinion in the matter, & on the other side if we should kill them a great many men, as tis possible & probable we may, those that remaine alive must expect noe quarter or mercy, all which I humbly leave to your worships consideration, with this provise, that if your Worships will have it defended we will God willing defend it to the last, & sacrifice our lives in the service."
1949,3,311,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,08/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date with a canoe loade[d] with lyme I have received. I have this morning ordered the survejor to build the outside of the wall with good marter & fill the inside with all swish, lyme being so verry scarce. This morning passed by this place to windward about forty canoes from the Mina, the Windhounds boate examined them all. Whither they were bound I know not. One came ashore to the Dutch Fort. John Cabesses man I advised you the Dutch took out of our canoe this night made his escape over the wall & came hither, he tells us that they expect [the] army verry speedily, and enquired mightily of him what was become of his master."
1950,3,312,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,09/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date with the lyme by the 11 hand canoe have received. I hope two canoe loads more will raise this flancker. I am glad to hear John Cabess is returneing, for I doubt the 300 soldiers they mention otherwise would never have been seen, if ever so great occasion should be of them. So soon as he arrives I will dispatch the Galley to you for bricks. I hope the fort is not in much danger, but it is good to prepare for the worst, knowing what neighbours we have by us. I hope in few days to be some thing better secured than at present we are, I have gott wild cockernutt trees enough to cover the flancker, which will serve both for joyces & boards, and by Thursday I hope it will be finished. Lieut. Keck says there is two gunns on the redoubt that will be verry fitt for our purpose if you thinck convenient to send them by that tyme, & if could have two more with them should be verry glad, these we have being too bigg for our worcks. I will with all the speed as can be secure another flancker & then we
shall be in no danger of being stormed by the Negroes, & I hope by that tyme thee designe may be over. The Dutch ships still ride as they did. You advised me you sent twenty four Black soldiers, here is but nineteen. If John Cabess come we shall be well enough guarded."
1951,3,313,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,12/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date per the 11 hand canoe loaded with lyme I have received. The Quiferas may promise what they will, but they must doe as their master order them, & I am very sure that the Dutch has since I has been here offered to make up the palavera with John Cabess &ca & pay whatever they demand to turne us out, therefore there must be the same designe in bringing downe the Quiferas, and for Adoome Ashrevy I hear is lickewise bribed, and to my knowledge refused Taggee his assistance & have rather assisted the Quiferas. If guns that lately came over are to large for this place you may charge two at Annamaboe, them being almost all small and wants larger, and then we shall have two on every flancker. These we have here already with after fireing will bring downe all our work. When another flancker is up we shall be as secure in our possession as we can be till there is a tanck. Water Capt. Piles says he has none for me. I designe to raise another flancker before I make dry lodgings for the men, which I fear must be made without thack [= thatch] to fence till after the rains. If those palavers was but over that we could safely suffer thack in the fort. The two canoes you sent hither to me a Friday I would have sent one to Dickies Cove to fetch the sawyers to saw the cokernutt trees, & neither of them would goe, soe that I was forced to gett a canoe that was just going of to Cabo Corso to goe to Dickies Cove, and a Sunday morning they went a fishing, as they pretended to me, & have never seen them since, so I supose they are returned to your parts & I have not a canoe here. Capt. Piles if you order me in your next I will send downe for bricks & lyme, & I hope he may be here again before we are in any danger.
PS. The black soldiers are at me for mony, I know not what agreement you have made with them. I desire with the small guns shott, cartridge [ms. 'partridge'] baggs & cartridges fitting for them."
1952,3,314,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,13/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date with its conten[t]s I have received. Anta Ashrevy I know is our enemy, but it is Adoome Ashrevy I say refused Taggee his assistance, but I beleive if Taggee has good success, we need not fear any thing but want of water. Capt. Piles I have sent downe, who I desire may bring bricks & lyme with the timber from Annamaboe for the next flancker. This is in a readiness to brick & tarras, therfore I desire that I may have 2 hogsheads tarras, & the remainder of her loading lyme, & the other all bricks, which I hope will keep the men employed till you send the Galley. I hope you will order a Doctor to send some medicines, here is two of the bricklayers tacken verry ill & one carpenter, the latter I have sent downe. The Dutch landed yesterday forty hogsheads water, & this day a great canoe loaded all with provisions, from the Mina. We spend all upon the provisions you sent, for here is nothing else for us. Here is nothing to be done with these Black soldiers, some have not been here above fiveteen days & they say they will be all gone if I doe not give la 6ta each. I should have a Cabbosheer here & then I could doe better with them than I can, for they thinck I keep the mony for myselfe, & they say you promised them that every new month they should have la 6ta each, and if not they will go to Cabo Corso, if I will not lett them goe in the great canoe they will goe by land. Wee want some twyne for the gunner & bricklayers use, allso two or three spare axle trees for the guns that came this day."
1953,3,315,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,15/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date with what sent by the 11 hand canoe I have received. I am sorry that both canoes are not fitting to come as I may have lyme and bri[c]ks. However, we goe on with another flanker in the mean tyme, and only the outside stones layed in morter, the other swish. I should be glad to have this flancker paved as we may mount the guns on it, which will be of great defence to us. The curtaine walls I raise all with stones because I would use as few bricks as possible, knowing the charge it is to sent them. The Black soldiers I will content as long as I can without any more mony, and when they ask me againe I will pay them according to your order. About two days since all the croomes about us were burnt, and we know not the meaning of it, but thought it to be the Dutch slaves, but this morning I understand that it was some out scouts from the Quiferas army. They will not macke any pretences on us till they have conquered Tagee, if they should it would too plainly show the Generall of the Minas false hart. I wish we may not be molested, if we are I doubt our case will be but bad, but I doe assure you I will not eassely loose possestion. A Cabusheer will be very convenient, if any body of men should apear, to send upon a palavera, for I must [ms. 'naust'] not pretend to face out with them but keepe faire as long as possible & perswade them to our interest, if they are soe to be dealt with all, as to be sure if they conquer Taggee they will pretend the country to be theirs, & soe may say that none shall settle but those that make agrement with them. I wish Taggee may have success, & then need not make noe doubt of all this. I want trucks, & axle trees for the guns & twyne for lynes for the bricklayers & gunners use, & some thred to make cartridges. If you please to send another man in [the] Captains
roome he will goe down tomorrow, but is not willing to goe till another comes. If you send none he desire the arms that is in his roome.
PS. Here is noe cloath come for the Captain of the black soldjers. Since the sealing of this the slaves informe me that the bumboy sold the slaves missing, the truth of which I know not but have sent him downe by the canoe to prevent any further loss, & I desire two bomboys, one not being sufficient to take carre of soe many slaves."
1954,3,316,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,19/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date I have received. I know the Royall Companye is not indepted to the Mina Blacks, nor did I ever hear that their canoes was so panjard by any, but it is licke a Dutch trick, & I doubt not but you will easely come up with them. I presume that you beleive their designe is on us here, or they need not endeavour to put us backward in building. Indeed they have hindred us mightily, we have done noe work since Monday morning for want of lyme and bricks, and if we had been supplyed we might have had another flancker ready to floar [= floor] by Saterday night, and then we might not have so much feare of the Negros. If I have never so great occasion canot send you a letter but when you send canoes, for here is none, which is very hard. I doubt not if the Quiferas overcomes Taggee but the Generall of the Mina will send white men to direct them to storme us here, and if wee can defend ourselves we have not water for above five or six dayes. I hear that one of the great canoes is staved & Mr Jordan is missing, which I hope not true. I can ill spare the surveyor before the bussiness is over, which I hope will be tyme enough. As soon as I see how things are I will send him away to lay out planck for us & cutt the axle trees lickwise. I have herewith sent seven musketts that are not servicable, I desire seven per next. The shott you send with the last gunns fitt only one, they are all too bigg for the others, therfore desire by a two hand canoe 100 smaller & some smaller patridge [= cartridge] baggs.
PS. Leiut. Keck desires the armes in his roome whether you continue him here or not."
1955,3,317,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,22/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 19th & 21th instant I have received. By this canoe goes Basjohn. Capt. Piles arrived in this roade last night, I shall make the best I can of the lyme
he has brought, which will serve the people to work about two days or three, you may be assured that none here shall stand idle whilst I can employ them about any things towards the secureing the Royall Company possestion. Stone I have almost enough broake to build the fort. So soon as I heard the canoes were seiz'd on I had all the curtain walls run up with swish [to a] mans height to save us from small shott, which must come downe as you supply us with lyme. The Galley will be with you this day, in her goes Leiut. Keck. The fort is now almost as secure as it will [be] before the rains. I desire the shott wrote for in my last, & lines for the briklayers, with twyne for gunners use.
PS. The bricklayer I send downe is indebted for provisions 12as 4ta, the carpenter 2.8. I desire may be stopt at pay day, & the rest for the mens pay send hither, for they are all indepted for provitions & mony lent, therfore desire that noeone may stop their mony or their [= they] cannot subsist the next 2 months."
1956,3,318,Charles Jordan,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,22/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday I arrived here safe. The Mina canoes fish to windward of the Mina & keep together in great numbers, & 3 or 4 men in a canoe, and I beleive mostly armed. The cheif occasion of this is to thanck your worships for your favours, and also to assure you that I will in all matters be continually zealous & carfull in the Royall Company affairs, hoping also your Worships will thinck me so too. I begg your Worships as soon as palaver is made up with Mina people to send to me by first safe convoyance the five ounces for the things they penyard from me, and what else allowed for the abuse, which I humbly conceive ought to be considered, & not satisfied with less than a marcke, as I pretended I lost, besides other things. I desire creditt for a Guiney stuff, or a piece of perpetuano for a cloath for my boy Hansicoe, & that by first canoe sent hither, order Bomboy to send him to [me]."

Our lyme will all be spent tomorrow. I desier the shott formerly desired & all the other necessarys. If we have water caske we can fille water here, such as it is, & if not should Taggee lose the feild, & the Quiferas come upon us, we shall find the want of it."
1958,3,320,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,01/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of this date have just received, with the particulers sent, and have sent downe the bricklayer. The shott are of the same sortes I received before, & are much to bigg for one of the guns, they will not enter the mussell [= muzzle], so desire less. The musketts I received. I am glad Taggee is likely to gaine the victory, but wish they had ended the matter. The Dutch have sent to the Danckeras for assistance; the King of the Danckeras men was at the Mina a Thursday last, which I presume you may have heard. Our bread is short, and we can gett no cankey, nor any thing more then what you send. Wee have not ten days bread. & beaf but two casck, and peeze almost all spent, so that our provitions is butt short. If Taggee has the victory it is well, but if not we shall soon be in want. I desire on accompt of all the mens pay & [sic] money to pay them with. This canoe goes another with four of Taggees soldiers which came to me and requested a canoe. We have sent downe two of the Black soldjers that are canoe men with them, & desire they may be returned in the morning. Here is more of his people here, but had not a canoe to send them in.
PS. Thomas Howard is indepted 5a 2[?] _ta"
1959,3,321,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,04/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 2d instant I have just received. Basjohn brought noe to[o]ls hither, but I have sent what can be spared, accompt of which is here inclosed. I hope by this tyme the Galley is returned with shells.
PS. William Sessons being verry ill I have given him leave to goe downe by this canoe. He is indepted 4a 7_ta to provitions. Our match is the best part of it spent, I desire more of this contrey match to burn all night or we shall use abundance of English, alsoe sheet lead to make two spouts for the flancker."
1960,3,322,Edward Searle,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,06/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"Soe soone as I had wrote you my last I was seized with a feavour. which held me for a considerable tyme and at this present is verry violent upon me. Besides I find a hardness in my belly, and noe convenient place for a sick man to be in. nor any necessaryes to help myselfe withall, & nothing to drinck that is fitting for a feavour but muddy water, therfore desire that you'l as soon as possible send a canoe to bring me downe to Cabo Corso to stay there tell I am recovered, which I hope will not be long were I in a place convenient, & if I lay here being sick. I shall I am sure throw myselfe away, for its impossible for a sick man to subsist here.
PS. I humble desire a little of wine or bear [= beer] or anything fitting to drinck."
1961,3,323,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,09/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"I returne you my most humble service & harty thancks for the many & continued favors I have received at your hands, and doe assuredly promise that I will act nothing in the station you have been pleased to place me in save what shall be to your Worships honour & creditt and the Royall Companys interest and advantage. I should here acquaint you with the particulers wanting to carry on the work of the Fort, as also about a supply of provitions, powder &ca, but shall referr you to Mr Searle, whom I discoursed about these things this morning, att parting. The Doctor, John Browne soldjer, surveyor and 2 Black carpenters went along with Mr Searle, I hope you will not long detaine them, here being none left to carry on the worcks. All the soldiers are paid, except John Brittaine, who was left out of the bill, if he must be paid here pray advise what his pay is, & if any to be stop'd out of it. All our man are in verry good health, but much pinch'd for want of fresch provisions, and good liquors. I desire you would be pleased to [send] me up some brandy & rum & lymejuce, & let it come in the canoe that brings up the Doctor, least the canoemen spoile it. Here is not a lock in the Castle nor any hasps for hanging locks, soe desire the same may be shortly sent up, expecially to secure the powder. Mr Jordan is verry much indisposed with the flux, so is desirous to have some thing sent up to give him dose, or else you would please to send for him to Cabo Corso. The black soldiers importunes me verry much for money & say that what you gave them at [ms. 'to'] Cabo Corso was for a dashee. Mr Searle has since given them a months pay, pray advise me herein, for I shall not supply them till I receive your orders."
1962,3,324,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,11/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"By this canoe comes John Brittain and Thomas Wilkinson, both violently afflicted with the flux, in so much that at present they are not able to doe any duty, the latter of whom 2 nights since was bitt in the neck by a snacke [= snake], which in 4 hours tyme did cause such extrodinary pain, besides a great swelling, that we all cuncluded it would either have kill'd the fellow or made him goe distracted. Brittain is indepted for provitions 9a 3ta, which I desire you will please to stop out of the next payment. This morning the briklayers wrought up all the lyme, soe hope you will supply us with more verry suddenly. I beleive another canoe full will finisch this flancker wee are about soe high as to the laying on the timbers, but further wee cannot goe on with it except the carpenters be returned to gett the wood in readiness. I doubt not but if we are wel supplyed with lyme & bricks to have two flanckers finished before the rains.
There is noe want of stones ready broake & part of the slaves are daily employed that way. Pray send up two soldjers in place of these men, and by all means the Doctor with medicines. The men are much afflicted with the grips and flux, which I supose is cheifly occasioned by the badness of the water. Yesterday about 4 of the cloak Mr Pinck and Mr Jordan went from hence for Dickies Cove."
1963,3,325,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,13/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours with all the necessaryes by the 11 hand canoe I have received verry safe, except the lyme, which is verry much damaged by the salt water, so desire you will please to lett the next shells Capt. Piles brings us be burnt here. What lyme you have ready burnt pray send with all expedition, for one canoe full serves not above 3 days. The Arda slaves are verry much necessit[at]ed for provitions in so much that some of them are fallen sick and others verry weack, scarce able to do any worck. Here is not come or any sort of food to be had for money, so that if they are not supplyed from Cabo Corso with corn or yams they will be in a miserable condition verry shortly. This is but a sickly place at present, so hope you will not lett us want medicines and one skilfull to apply them, here being none that can lett blood if never upon so great occasion. Here is great need of water cask, there being but 6 in the fort, which would not containe water enough to serve us 5 days if besieged. If you please to furnish us with 18 or 20 hogsheads empty, we can gett them fill'd here, but the carpenter must order them better then the others he hath sent, else the water will all be spoyl'd with the beef pi[c]kle. I desire you to send me per next canoe a stone jarr to keep water in, if you do not use that on the battlements it will fitt my purpose. As for the European provisions I shall not be att all lavish of them, but the soldjers have nothing else to live upon, so that had need be well supplyed with all sorts. I desire to be enformed what powder, rum & palme oyle is allowed monthly for the use of the fort. Att this time there is much powder used both by the whitemen and blacks in clearing their armes once or twice a weak, soe that I hope you will pleased during these troublesome tymes to allow something extrodinary on accompt of the powder. According to order have sent downe the Black carpenter Alampo, whom we shall want as well as the rest in a verry short tyme. They must be sure to bring all such toolls along with them as will be used for cutting and squaring of tymber and about the carpenters work. Pray hasten the locks and lett the smith make 6 hasps of severall sizes.
PS. Yesterday the Gunner was seized with a violent feavour, and is verry desireous to be sent for Cabo Corsoe."
1964,3,326,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,16/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"By this canoe comes the Black carpenter Alampo, who unknown to me stayd behind the 11 hand canoe, for what reason I know not, but after she was out a league att sea he came in to the fort, and told me the canoe men would not stay till he had fetch'd his chest or what else he wanted from his house, this is the only excuse he made for his neglect. This day we have to finish the flancker we are about, to the laying of the tymbers, which shall be done tomorrow or next day. The lyme you last sent will be all wrought up today, and except wee are supplyed twice or 3 tymes a weak the men cannot go on with their worck as may be expected. When you send upp the lyme pray supply us with a canoe of bricks. I desire you to send up some sheet lead for making spouts for the flanckers, also a barrell of tarr for the gunns, 2 brushes & 2 powder horns with primeing irons. On Sunday last some of our Black soldiers together with the Bomboy & most of our men slaves, unknown to me, rambled upp towards the Adoom country to fetch corne, who when they had gott their bootey, was sett upon by a party of the Adooms, well armed, who kill'd one of the Black soldiers and cutt of his head, and for ought I can imagine have either kill'd or panjard five of the Royall Companys slaves which are yett missing. I had given your Worships an accompt of this action yesterday, but that I was in hopes before this tyme some or all of the slaves might have been returned. I will not here trouble you any more about this matter, because the bearer hereof is come purposely to give you a relation of the whole bussiness. I wish you would be pleased to send up another bomboy in roome of this, for he more hinders then forwards the slaves in their worck. If the Serjeant or my selfe was not constantly amongst them in the tyme of their worck, I beleive one halfe of them would be idle all the day. Besides I do [ms. 'due'] impute the loss of these slaves wholey to his negligence, for had he not forc'd them to goe with him, not one of them durst have sturr'd from their houses. I hear nothing as yet of any ships to windward."
1965,3,327,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,23/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"The bearer hereof Serjant Wilson being verry desirous to goe to Cabo Corso for
2 or 3 days, have given him leave, with whom comes Isaac Ogbourn, haveing for severall days been violently afflicted with a feavour. I desire you will please to send up another in his room, here being but few men in the fort att this tyme. Six days agoe we lay'd the tymber upon the flanckers, but since that tyme not a stone lay'd for want of lyme. Could we be but well supply'd with bricks & lyme, I am sure the whole building might be finished in 5 months tyme, which if otherwayes the rains will destroy, all our men haveing nothing to shelter them from the weather. I hope you will dispatch Capt. Piles hither with all the shells he bring
from Accra. Since my last fo[u]r of the slaves are return'd, but one of them as the others relate was panyard and carryed up into the country. If you doe not send corne & yams to releive those here verry suddenly they will all be disabled from doing any worck, and severall of them dye out of meere necessity. Here is not a graine or come or any fisch to be bought, that if it were not for palme berrys & such trash as the poor slaves pick amongst the bushes they would all of them ere now have been quite famished. Pray advise me what pay the black soldjers have per months, this morning they came to me for their money & demanded la 6ta each man. Mr Searle told me when he went from hence that in 14 days their pay would become due to them, which tyme was expired yesterday. The necessarys you send up are come safe to hand, but not halfe lead enough to make the spouts. I have sent per the Serjeant a small case containing 6_ gallons, which I desire you will please to send per bearer with brandy, and an anchor of lymjuce, as also the particuleers under written.
[PS] I referr you to Serjeant Willson, who will give you an [ms. 'on'] accompt what provitions are wanting.
Necessarys wanting: beds, comes [? = coines] & trucks for all the gunns, 6 hasps for doors, _ m [= 1,000] 4d nails, _ m 2d ditto, 2 small gimbletts, 3 spung[e] staffs, rammer heads, 6 worms for the great guns. To be mended: 3 musquetts, 1 larg[e] saw, 5 wedges, 1 mawle.
Cape Coast Tom went from hence last night."
1966,3,328,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,01/05/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours received, together with one cask beefe & one of flower, but the case of brandy as the canoe men enforme me Captain Peter would not suffer them to bring now. I hope the letter I sent yesterday to Mr Ronan is received, by which you will understand what necessity we are [ms. 'were'] in at this tyme, & expecially for bread. As for the flower it will be of little or noe use to me except I had palme wyne, which at this tyme is not to be purchased. If I have not some come sent up I cannot possibly subsist, therfore earnestly entreat you to supply me with 2 or 3 chests in a day or two at furthest, for all my fowles dye for want of meat to give them. What necessarys are wanting towards carrying on the fort, I advised you of in my former letters, so referr you to them, only desire we may be suply'd so soon as possible you can, else the rains will verry much damage the flanker wee are now a building. There is as great want of bricks as  lyme, therfore desire both may be sent together. Seven of our Arda men slaves run away last Sunday, & are not yet returned or heard of, & I am much afraid of the rest unless some recruits are sent them. I writ in my last about the black soldjers pay, but haveing noe answer could not putt them off any longer, so paid them this morning la 6ta each man. 3 days agoe they had all run away from me, but I sent a file of musquetteers downe to the water side & fetch in to the fort 3 canoes which they designed should have carryed them to Cabo Corso. Pray faile not to supply me with the necessarys above said, & when you send me the brandy let the key of the case come with it, & a small anchor of lymejuce, for I have not any left. By this canoe come[s] Robert Ogleby, soldier, who has been so ill this 5 or 6 days that I t[h]ought he would have dy'd distracted with the violent feavour [which] was upon him, & here is not one can lett blood though never so great necessity. Last night & the morning came hither near 60 soldiers, who intend to remain here till John Cabess come to them.
PS. Here are now but a few man in the Fort, so desire you to dispatch the Serjeant & what men you can spare."
1967,3,329,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,04/05/1695,Fort,RAC,"On Tuesday in the afternoon came hither John Cabess, accompanyed with a great number of Blacks, and intends to remaine here till the returne of this canoe, afterwards will goe for a few days to Abbraboe. He desires you will please to give him creditt for 5 pieces of stript sattins, & lett them all be according to the inclosed pattern & sent up by the bearer, who comes purposely for them. All the Dutch canoes that have pass'd along since he came hither, his people have panjard, & yesterday morning came 2 Mina canoes from windward, both loaden with palme wine from Dickies Cove, there was in all 19 anchors, all which was brought ashore, though the Dutch fired att least 20 small arms shotted at the canoemen as they brought them in, yet hurt never a man. All our tradesmen lye idle for want of lyme & bricks, soe desire you will send up canoes, that we may goe on with the worck. The last 2 days rain did noe small damage to the flancker they are now carrying up, & which was finished all but the battlements before Mr Searle went away, now letts in water in 3 or 4 severall places, but I suppose it may easily be stopp'd when the lyme comes upp. We hear nothing of the seven slaves that are run away."
1968,3,330,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,07/05/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours have received, but much doubt Mr Pincks returne from Dickies Cove before the tyme you advise the Dutch ships will sayle, so intend on Thursday morning to hire a 2 hand canoe & come for Cabo Corso. Yesterday in the afternoon. John Cabess went from hence, and as I am since enformed is gone to macke a palaver with the Adoomes, who have received & protected severall of the Quiferas women. I [ms. 'It'] suppose it will be a fortnight or more before he returns to Commenda, though great number of people are daily comeing & begin to build, so that do not doubt in a short time we may have as good if not better trade then our neighbours."
1969,3,331,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,18/05/1695,Fort,RAC,"This serves only to acquaint you that at my arrivall at Comenda I mett with John
Cabess, who has been return'd since last Thursday, but what palavera he hath
made I know nothing of it as yet. I told him of your intention about panyaring the Mina canoes, who readily embraced the motion, & says if he once receive your orders, not one shall escape him. I have had great damage by the rains since I went to Cabo Corso, both in my cloaths &ca, which I had lodged in the flanker already finished. The water runs into it so verry much that if it be not suddenly stopped, will certainly spoil all the floor over the powder roome. Here are a great throng of people already come to inhabit insomuch that they have built howses almost as low as the landing place. I belive there are above 40 canoes already come, so that I hope we shall not want for fish, but come is as s[c]arce as ever [ms. 'over']. The 17 black soldiers have promised me to go for Cabo Corso this day, from whom I have received 4 musquetts belonging to the Fort, which was lent them by myself.
PS. There are 4 musquetts lost by the soldiers, which were delivered to them by Mr Searle & reckoned in the inventory."
1970,3,332,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,21/05/1695,Fort,RAC,"Just now I received yours, & imediatly sent for John Cabes, whome I have made privy to your commands. He assured me they shall be strictly observe'd and forthwith put in execution. In order thereunto he desires you to send him as many slaves irons as possibly you can, not haveing any to secure those he panyars, severall of his prisoners of warre have lately made their escapes from him for want of such necessarys. As to building near the Dutch fort, he hath already made this [ms. 'theis'] palavara with the people, that whoever goes to erect a house on that side of the salt pond, the chief actor shall have his head cutt of, and the rest be made slaves without redemption, and that noe fisherman is to supply the Dutch Copeman or his people, upon paine of the licke penalty. Yesterday the town Cabbesheers came to demand their custome, which they say is a whole say & 6 gallons rum. I have desired their forberance till I can receive your ordres, which I desire may be by the first opportunity, for till they are sattisfied I shall have noe quitenesse. The [= this] morning I sent up into the country along with some of John Cabess men, 21 of our slaves, whome he had orderd to load with corne, I haveing agred to pay him 3a per chest. Along with the bearer comes John Cabess boy, to whome he desires you to deliver one of the Company silver headed sticks, because at his return he intends to goe himself and make a palavaro with the Adoms to come down & trade, as also to send some sort of goods to take up [ms 'yp'] along with him. He left a cloth that you gave to him for a dashee, & now desires to have it sent by his boy. He further desires to know what you will be pleased to allow him here per month & what you have agreed to doe concerning the palavero he made with you about Mr Elwes, whome as he relates is indepted to him 11 bendys loz 7a of gold."
1971,3,333,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,28/05/1695,Fort,RAC,"Since Fryday last here has been such excessive raine that it has beat down one end of the house I lay in, so that now I am forced to lye under a shed in the Castle, nor can I secure my selve there from the weather except I have tarpawling to cover over the boards, which are so crack'd & shattered that not one in five of them but letts the water in upon me. I desire you will please to send one with all expedition 13 foote square, els not only my selfe but what necessarys I have will receive much damage thereby. Here are two leys [= lies] over the powder roome, but neither of them must be remov'd for fear of spoiling the powder. When you send the tarpawling pray send up some chests of sheets, here haveing been severall traders since Satturday would have bought a great quantity if they could have been supplyed. The soldiers are verry importunate with me for their pay, & desire you will order it by the first conveyance. Since my last I have heard nothing more about the Mina palavera. Pray advise me how you rate a whole chests of sheets when sold together.
PS. Here are slaves daily brought to be sold, so wish you to supply me with goods to purchase them. Sheets are most desir'd."
1972,3,334,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,01/06/1695,Fort,RAC,"Haveing the opportunity of this conveyance by Mr Jennings canoe, which came hither last night, thought fit to acquaint you that John Cabess went from hence towards the Adoomes yesterday morning, being call'd on by seaverall of Great Taggees people. Pray supply me with the necessarys I wrote for in my last by Tuesday or Wednesday att furthest, & advise me what I shall do concerning buying of slaves, which daily come hither to be sold. I have not irons to putt any in, so desire you to send up some by the canoe that brings upp the goods."
1973,3,335,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,03/06/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 1st instant I received last night, but the tarpawling was left at Cabo Corso. I desire it may be sent by the bearer, as also 6 gallons brandy, 100 weight of sugar, a cask lymejuce, 1 gallon sweet oyle, 2 gallons vineager, & a cask mallagetta to give amongst the slaves which I am now about buying. If you will be pleased to furnish me with the large tarpawling I formerly wrott for I can secure a great quantity of goods in the shed. I now lye in one of the flankers, which I am now getting thatch'd for that purpose. I do not think it convenient at present to build any other house, but to lye in the shed till the storm be quite blowne over, so shall employ the slaves in getting of stone ['] fetching of swish. Pray send me up what slaves irons you can spare at present, els I know not how to keep those I shall buy with safety. Come here is verry dear, the lowest price being 6a chest, but beleive I can procure so much from John Cabess and others as will serve my purpose with good husbandry till there be new corne."
1974,3,336,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,07/06/1695,Fort,RAC,"I desire you will be pleased to lett me know what money is due to the Royall Companys slaves, who now begin to done [= dun] me for their pay, & send me up one quarter cask rum, one ditto of palme oyle, as also the slaves irons and mallegetta I wrote for in my last.
PS. Pray send up a halberd for the Serjeant."
1975,3,337,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,08/06/1695,Fort,RAC,"This morning came downe to me from the Quifero's country one of the king of Aguaffo's men, & Captain Amo's, with the following palaver, which they did desire me to give you an accompt of this night, vizt that the Generall of the Mina has already sent up to the Wassaw's & Anta Ashrevy 50 bendys in gold, to hire them to come downe & fight Tagee & John Cabess, but those people not att all consenting to the Generalls proposalls, immediatly sent it [i.e. the gold] away to Taggee & would have him accepted of it, but he refuseing ordered them to return it, & hath since in the behalfe of the English agreed to give them 20 bendys, which he desires you will not fayle to send him up with all speed, either in gold or goods, which you please, carpett & boysadoes being only accepted
[= excepted] against.82 Great Taggee, John Cabess &ca being now at a place call'd Durnpim,83 they desire you to send up per the bearer a couple of sheets to give the two messingers that brought downe the news, for a dashee. Pray dispatch the canoe tomorrow for the 2 men are order'd to returne from hence on Munday, at furthest."
1976,3,338,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,12/06/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours received, together with the slaves irons and cask palm oyle, which was not above _ full. On Munday night John Cabess came hither & desires you will dispatch the canoe sent on accompt of Taggee['s] palaver with the Wassaws, his men remaining here on purpose to waite her returne. Ockamy, the Captain of Commenda, had lately his wife panyard in comeing from Cabo Corso by the Mina people and sold on board the Portuguez ship which was brought in thither last weak. He is inform'd she sayl'd from thence yesterday & is come to an anchor of Cabo Corso road. John Cabess in his behalfe desires you to gett her releas'd & sent hither per the bearer, & what charge you are at he will be sure to see defray'd. I should have enlarg'd but time will not permitt, it being verry late before the Captain of the Town came to me with the palaver."
1977,3,339,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,14/06/1695,Fort,RAC,"On Wednesday night about 8 of the clock, arrived here Mr Jennings from Dickies Cove, but in such a distracted condition as I seldom or never see any, & ever since hath continued delirious.84 The hamock men which brought Mr Pinck I never see, since he went from hence, so conclude they went for Cabo Corso along with the soldiers. Earnest Week Gunner is verry weak with the flux, & for my owne part I have had a violent feavor & ague this 3 days, & fear tis lickely to continue. Be pleased to send me up the great tarpawlin I formerly desired, for except I can secure myselfe better from the bad weather, I shall have great reason to dread a tedious fitt of sickness. My ague fitt is just now comeing up on me, so take leave."
1978,3,340,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,16/06/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours I received, and have aquainted Ookamy, the Captain of the towne, with what you writt me concerning his wife, as alsoe Taggees people who still remains here expecting your answer. I paid the canoe hire but no canky mony to the men that brought downe Tagee['s] palaver yesterday, and all last night I was extreamly afflicted with the ague & especially the feaver, which continued till
this morning at 8 of the clock, so I was forc'd (though much against my will) to send up to the Dutsch fort for a black they have there to lett me blood, since which I have been much better, but have nothing to take whereby to give me ease. I have sent downe the Gunner by this canoe, who is growned so exceeding [ms. 'exceedrag'] weak that I belive he would have dyed had he stay'd here 3 days longer. There comes in company with him John Dobson soldier, who came hither from Dickies Cove this morning in a verry weak and lame condition.85 I wish you would be pleased to send some one hither that can both administer physick & lett blood, else all must be great suffere[r]s if sickness happen, by reason we are at so great a distance from you. My hands tremble so much that I am scarce able to write, so take leave."
1979,3,341,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,21/06/1695,Fort,RAC,"According to your order I have sent downe all the brickayers. Our slaves are verry urgent for their pay, being in want of money to buy provitions. I would desire you to sent money, or an accompt what their pay comes to, & I will pay them. I am still extreamly bad with the feavor and a verry great pain in my head, & so faint that I am not able to stur. I would desire your worships to send me [a] little cord[i]all waters, & some Venns treatle for two or three sweats,86 & three or four doses of phissicke, by reason one of our men want a dose &ca. I would desire a quarter cask rum, & four cheeze if you have any good."
1980,3,342,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,26/06/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours I received of Gamatan,87 & according to order will advance the slaves each of them one angle. This morning about seven a clock John Cabes went to meet the Dutsch Copeman to palaver with them, as he use to doe severall times before, upon the sand by the Dutch Fort, John Cabbess haveing six men the Copeman ten, when after som[e] time being seated in their chairs and some discourse past, the Copeman haveing two pistolls in his packett [= pocket], drew out one & fired at John Cabess, which he perceiveing fell out of the chair upon the sand before the pistoll went off. The Copeman fired the other pistoll at him as he lay on the sand, but John Cabess grabling88 about escapt the fury of them both, & by the asistance of his men gott clear.89 The Copeman they say is wounded in the theigh with one of their swords, so went to his Fort & fired a great shott into the towne, & afterwards hang'd out their flagg, which is still flying, & I would desire you to send me two marques of gold by the bearer Gamatan. John Cabess would desire you to send a party of soldiers if you can to remain here. I am still verry ill."
1981,3,343,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,04/07/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours I received with the two marques of gold, & did acquaint John Cabess what mony he had had on accompt of his pawne, who [he] saith in a short time he will discharge. I would desire you to send an [ms. 'on'] accompt of the slaves pay, who are so inpatient that I cannot be at quiest for them. I am still verry ill, haveing a verry great pain in my head, that I cannot rest night or day, & desire you to send me something that might move it, & two blanketts, & a brass kettle."
1982,3,344,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,13/07/1695,Fort,RAC,"I give you many thanks for sendeing Mr Julois up,90 & God be praised, I begin to be something better, tho verry weak, that I am not able to write to you, but I hope in a short time to gather strength. I received the two blanketts you sent by the boy, butt for the brass kettle I know nothing of. I would desire you to send the Whitemens pay, they haveing at pay day 4 months due to them, & are in want of mony to buy corn or other necessarys, haveing no provitions for them in the Fort. As for the slaves they refuse to take 1a each, they will have their whole pay, therfore I would desire you to send the accompt & mony to pay them. The 11th instant we buryed Thoomas Heycock the carpenter. I would desire you to supply me with 4 gallons brandy more, & then not trouble you till a ship comes."
1983,3,345,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,18/07/1695,Fort,RAC,"On Satturday night last I sent my boy Gamatan to Cabo Corso along with Mr Julois, but since have not heard of him. If you have sent him away from thence he is certainly panyard by the Mina people. Since Tuesday night our bomboy has been missing, I desire to know whether he be come to Cabo Corso. I had intended to have sent him downe as this night, for he was so horridly abusive to the slaves that they all came togither & told me, exept I sent him away they would all go to Cabo Corso. He never would keep all to the Companys work, but would dayly have part of them to fetch his wood, to sell in the market for his owne use. I have at present put in one Coffee, a lusty young black fellow, one that speaks English verry well, and I beleive will behave himselfe civilly. Since my last I have paid all the slaves 1a each, but the bomboy none. Pray if my boy is not come away send up the slaves accompts, that they might be cleared to a day, for they are hard put to it to gett victualls, & the white mens pay, they being very much necessitated to gett provitions, everytheing here being att an unreasonable rate. I am now forc'd to pay 9 taccoes for 5 little boys, & glad that I can gett them for mony. Pray send a skeain of Englisch match & 6 balls [ms. 'ballt'] of country ditto, there is not an inch of English match in the Fort but what is on the linstocks,91 alsoe 2 or 3 dosen of hoops ready made upp of 2 or 3 sizes to put in the powder barrels. The powder room is so extraordinary damp that itt rots everything that is putt in itt. We are forc'd once a weacke to carry the powder upon the flanckers to dry, but now wee cannot stirr a barrell except they be new hoop'd. I have ordered the Gunner to take up a firkin tallow to make me some candles, which be pleased to place to my accompt."
1984,3,346,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,23/07/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours I received together with the 2mk gold, which did not hold out to pay the men by 5oz 12a 1ta, as you will see by the inclosed bill. The slaves are daily at me about their pay, & say that the la paid them is all they have had for 5 months. The Serjeant says he believe it is full so long time since Mr Searle paid them. I wisch you would be pleased to lett me know what remains the due to them, for I am afraid if they are not paid, they will most of them run away. If the bomboy is not come to Cabo Corso I cannot imagine where he should go, ex[c]ept to the Dutch, for I have had the bushes all here about sought for him twice. The match & hoops you mentioned in your last the canoe men says was never delivered to them. At pay day I put in John Story [as] gunner, who [I] desire to know if you aprove of him & will allow him his usuall pay & match mony from this pay day, he doth promise to be verry carefull in his employ. Be pleased to send up the goods together with their prices as under written.
PS. 1 baile carpetts, 20 oz corrall, 20 iron barrs, 1 bale green perpetuanoes, 50 1 lb pewter basons, 1 bale white blankets."
1985,3,347,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,07/08/1695,Fort,RAC,"I received yours this morning, & imediatly sent for the slaves and a guide, and send him away. I gave the slaves lta each and the guide 2a to buy them cankey. The guide demanded how much I would give him for his pains, but that I told him he would know at Cabo Corso, so that if you pay him be pleased to let me know, or order me what I shall give him.
PS. Slaves sent to Cabo Corso: Quan, Affodue, men; Quack, Quo, Yow, boys."
1986,3,348,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,15/08/1695,Fort,RAC,"This is answer to yours of the 27th last month, when I received Mr Searle['s] old accompts & your aprobation of John Story being Gunner. There is not a neater men in the Companys service for cleanseing of small arms, it being formerly his trade, but except he be allowed match mony he will not act, & I am sure besides himself here is none capable. According to your order have sent an accompt of the expence of powder. It is verry hard upon me to give an accompts of every particulier cartridge of powder given out as such a time as when I first came, and the warr just ended, when I could not be att quiett for fresh comers for powder, as you will see per the bill. Had I denied all (though abundance went without) I am sure to have been reputed a verry ill man, & I believe it would not [at] that juncture have been for the Companys interest or reputation to have been pinching of a barrell of powder. As to the expence of lyquors I am sure I come verry little short of what charge the Company are at out of my own pockett, and yet have not given half the satisfaction I expected. Yours of the 13 instant have received, & can assure you there is nothing of truth in the palaver brought you about the serjeant and bomboy. T'is so far from any thing of that nature that my man has been this 3 dayes with Taggee & John Cabess on purpose to gett them to send downe to the Captain of the towne (who is a great rogue) to lett our whitemen be supplyed with fish. This is the second time I have been forced to send to John Cabess, the first time one of Taggees near relations, & did so because the Cabbosheers and fishermen that [w]as on assurance they would not play the rogue with the whitemen but lett them have what fish they wanted, he caused severall of them to lick the dust of the soles of his feet three times apeice with their tongues. I sent for the Captain of the towne as soon as received your letter & asked him the reason why he sent such a lying story to Cabo Corso, his answer was because I had sent to Taggee. We are verry hard put to it for want of provitions, some time 3 days together & no fish. I formerly writt for 3 or 4 dozen of hoopp for the powder barrells, which are now so decayed that we cannot touch them but they will fall in pieces. Pray send me some paper, for this is the verry last sheet. I have a great swellen [= swelling] fallen into both my leggs, that I am scarce able to stand, & such a great paine all over my limbs that I have very much adoe to write. I did expect to have seen the great canoe long since."
1987,3,349,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,18/08/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours received, and have inclosed returned your letter, which pray send me back againe by my boy when you have entered it. I have aquainted the Gunner with what you writt, who now is willing to embrace the employ upon your first proposall. The corne is come safe, 7 basquetts, which measured only 2 chests & one basket over & not a graine more. The hoopes my boy brought are good for nothing, being knokt of from old barrells, that they will not abeide driveing, pray lett the cooper send soome green ones that may doe service. I earnestly entreat you now to lett John Tygar, and another if you can spare him, be forthwith sent up. Wee have not men to doe duty here, being two of these five that are here sicke of feavors & ague. If possible send up the great canoe up this next weeke with goods desire[d]."
1988,3,350,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,23/08/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours with John Tygar have received, and returne you many thanks for sending him up. Some few hoops the cooper have sent but we cannot make use of them. He hath only splitt the sticks, not fitted them to any size. He should work them up, els we know not what to doe with them."
1989,3,351,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,07/09/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours with the goods have received. The blanketts & carpetts took some wett, but it proving indifferent fair weather this afternoon have open'd the bailes to dry them. The corrall so soon as I received it from the canoemen, the paper being broake, called the serjeant to see it weighed, and it wanted in weight loz 12a. Here had lately been some traders enquiring for the nicconnees and blew bafts, if you have any pray send some up by next canoe. I have by the great canoe sent downe 24 musquetts which are alltogether useless. Thomas Lee may cleanse and mend them, and if you please they may be kept at Cape Coast, we haveing here 22 more than what are constantly used by the soldiers, besides no one man is able to keep so many in good order. There where at my comeing 59, but the Cape Coast soldiers lost 4, & the night John Cabess had like to have been kill'd by the Dutch Copeman the Towne Cabbosheers borrowed [word illegible], one of which they have lost, so of what remains in the fort hang'd up, the soldiers arms in use, those lost & 24 sent downe make up the number 59. The sticks the cooper sent up for the powder barrells are of no manner of use, they being only cast asunder, if he do not fitt up some, & send by the canoe of 2 or 3 sizes, we shall have all the powder spoyled for want of aire."
1990,3,352,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,11/09/1695,Fort,RAC,"I have sent by my boy nine deale boards, which I desire you will please to lett Bastian gett sawn & bring them up the next week to make doers for the house. He must bring up some small hooks & hinges to hang them, here are some in the Fort but they will be to bigg for such slender works. I pray advise me per next what you sell the lead barrs for. as also the iron barrs, because I can sell some of the latter. The inclosed is the soldiers bill, which if you think fit to pay this day will verry acceptable to them, here being nothing to be had without the ready penny, and at unreasonable rate."
1991,3,353,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,18/09/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours received, and shall returne Bastian & Tyger according to order. When the slitt deals came up in the great canoe, 3 half deals were left behind, which I desire you would please to order by my boy, as also 200 2d & 200 4d nails, 2 small hanging locks, 12 small hinges for the windowes & hooks proportionable, here being none of either sort but what are too big to put upon slit deals, la knifes for my own use. The Cabbosheers of this towne never let me rest but are daily duning me for their custome, pray let me know what you please to doe with them. The custome Mr Searle paid them is in the accompt you sent me. Our owne slaves are not less troublesome, not haveing a cra cra to help themselves. By next great canoe be pleased to send up some nicconees and blue [ms. 'flue'] bafts."
1992,3,354,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,26/09/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 21st instant have received, & the next day acquainted the Cabbosheers of the towne with your answer, who seemed verry much disatisfied with it, but since I have not heard anything from them. The slaves are paid la per month for every month since I came hither, being 5 months beginning from the 29 March 1695, which was the first payement I made, to the 29 of the last month, and Sunday next there will be another pay day due to them. They say Mr Searle paid them only for 4 months each slaves, and that when he went away there was 2 months pay more due to them, for want of which they grumble extreamly. If you pl[e]ase it shall be paid them I will clear them next pay day. If some nails are not sent up Bastian cannot finish the wood work. For nailing on the hinges &a it may be easily done without him. I have got him to make me a desque [= desk] & want about 100 2d nails for the drawers, if any in the store pray send some by the boy. Here is but one axe in the Castle, which the other day cutting some timber broak, I have sent it to be mended and desire it may be returned by this canoe, for we cannot cutt any wood without it. Pray send up 2 sheeps skins, & some scupper nails, for we are in great want of them.
PS. Here is a flying report amongst the blacks of 2 English ships being to windward, but what place I cannot be enformed."
1993,3,355,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,30/09/1695,Fort,RAC,"I had sent Bastian to Cabo Corso last night according to order, but takeing phisick & it not operating save 2 times caused me to keep my [ms. 'me'] roome and bed all day, not being able to set pen to paper. The goods all came safe, save one of the half pieces broad black bafts which is wanting & I beleive forgott in the packing, the serjeant & myself haveing counted them over 3 times. Six of the sayes are extreamly much damaged, some of them being eaten through all the folds. There is noe certain rate can be sett on them, so that if you please to have them returned or that I shall sell them for what I can get, be pleased to give me your answer per next canoe. As to the slaves I shall observe your last dirictions, & had done it before now had I been advised. I hope you will spare me Bastian again in a little time. What work I have done here might if he had not idled away his time been finished in 4 or 5 dayes. I humbly thank you for letting John Tyger remaine here.
PS. Just now a Commenda canoe came from the Brandenburghs, haveing been there to buy a small canoe, who possitively affirms that there is a Dutch interloper lyes there who came out of Europe in company with 2 of our ships, & left them trading at Cestus. The interloper had been at the Brandenburgs since Satturday morning."

We want the hinges, hoocks and nails for the window shutters. There has been such excessive rains here of late that it has done much damage to the house by beating in at the windows. I wrote to you in my last about the damaged sayes, be pleased to give me order what I shall do with them, some of them are so eaten that I beleive if they where opened there is not a fathom off whole stuff in all the peice.
PS. Pray send me some inck and sealeing wax."
1995,3,357,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,15/10/1695,Fort,RAC,"I have herewith sent downe Serjeant Willson on purpose to bring me up some corn & what provition he can meet with all. I humbly begg of you to spare me what beef you can and send along with him. We here are so hard putt to it that I protest I never lived so in my life. I shall say no more, the Serjeant can well informe you. As yet we have not viewd the saies, but so soone as the Serjeant returns shall obey your order, and give you an accompt per next opportunity. The inck you send by my boy was lost, the cannoe being oversett."
1996,3,358,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,23/10/1695,Fort,RAC,"I am daily dunn'd by the Cabbosheers about their custome but have now at last prevailed with them to waite on you at Cabo Corso Castle. They alledge that Mr Elwes &a that have been here alwais paid it them, and they wounder now why should be so much slighted. This morning the Serjeant and Gunner according to your order have view'd the damaged saies, and do judge them to be worth no more then what is mentioned in the inclosed certificate."
1997,3,359,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,29/10/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours received, & humble thank you for your advise. I have not been at or neare the Dutch fort since I came hither but only the day Mr Searle went from hence. I shall take care to keep myselff out of their clutches, & as for our men I have them given sufficient warning. I believe the Dutch Copeman had design to have panyard my Serjeant, for on Satturday last he sent his boy 2 times to me that he would give him leave to come & eat part of a pigg. Pray advise what must be done about paying our men. The next weake there is 4 months pay due to them, which coomes to as you will see by the inclosed paper. They are verry pressing for their money, & especially now it draws near Christmas. I have not taken above 7oz gold since I came hither, els would have paid them. All the blanketts are sold excepting 10 or 11, soe desire you will please to send up some per first great cannoe. I heare here that the Copeman at Sumah is run soe much in debt that he is like to be served as his brother Crajers. The Dutch doctor was in our town 3 or 4 days agoe & told Serjeant Willson that the great ship brings over a new Generall, which news I wish may prove true."
1998,3,360,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,30/10/1695,Fort,RAC,"Haveing the opportunity of writing to you by this Comenda canoe bound for Cabo Corso, thought fit to acquaint you that this afternoon I panyard the Dutch Gunner belonging to their fort. I doe really believe though he promise not much it [sic], he is a verry ingenious fellow, haveing been Captain of a ship as he says & born others comands. He will wel informe you when you come to discourse him. Tomorrow I intend to send him for Cabo Corsoe. If I have done an ill action I heartily beg your pardon."
1999,3,361,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,01/11/1695,Fort,RAC,"I have herewith sent downe the Dutch Gunner, who beleive will be verry servicable to you at Cabo Corso or elswhere. He is reputed to be a great artist in gunnery and one that understand fortifications very well. Notwithstanding I wrote in my last that I had panyared him, yet that was only done at the fellows request, to save him from the gallows, in case he should be retaken before he gott to Cabo Corso, but his w[h]ole design of comeing hither was purposely to serve the English, and he told both me & Serjeant Willson that he was very much afraid they would fire at him from their fort when they see him come this way. He came to me early in the forenoon. The two markes of gold & goods I received safe, but there wants to make up their pay 6a 8ta, which I shall deposite at pay day. Be pleased to send me some quils and papers, this being the last peice that I have by me."
2000,3,362,Howsley Freeman,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,30/11/1695,Fort,RAC,"I understand by soome of our Dutch neighbours that the Galley is bound for Europe shortly after Christmas, I desire leave to take my passage in her for England. I am sorry that I am not in a condition of staying 3 years in the country. I am really reduced to soe very weack a condition that I am scarce able to rise out of my chaire without the helpe of my chaire or some to assist me. I was never soe much indisposed since I came to Guinea. My long sickness I beleive hath [ms. 'thath'] thrown me into a consumption, for I have not enjoyed my perfect health since the beginning of June last, that now I am soe very much out of order whatever I eat or drinck generally makes me [ms. 'my'] sick. I hath sent to you sooner but defered writing in hopes that I might recover my health & continue my station, but I find my selfs grow weaker and weaker. I hope the Royal I Company nor yourselfs can take it amisse, since tis the want of health obliged me to leave the country, nothing els should have done it. My [ms.

2002,3,364,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,18/12/1695,Fort,RAC,According to your order on seight of your letter I have sent the twenty four green perpetuanoes.
2003,3,365,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,21/01/1696,Fort,RAC,"This morning by break of day we descried a fleet of canoes to windward at Aberebe, & some few canoes to leaward apadleing up to them, who as soon as they had joyned the fleet they bore directly downe for Commenda, being about 50 small canoes, 3 people in each canoe, two flags one Dutch on[e], the other a bloody flag, a red one. Our towne people were in no small confusion, bringing their wives, children, mats, basketts, pipkins &a into the Castle yard, all scampering about in such a confused manner as if the enemy had been behind him a cutting their throats. In this hurly burly John Cabess came to mee and begged for Gods sake to give some powder, he have none to give his men, which I readily condescended. I encouradge John Cabess all I could, telling him if he could not hinder their landing, as I did imagin he could not, by reason of the Dutch Castle, then to retreat to the Royall Company fort, and if they should dare to offer any insolence that we would stand by him as long as we are able. He promised he would, but notwithstanding all his promises hath it come to the test I beleive he & his people had taken to the bushes. It is pitty the fort is not better man'd, for fear of some such sudden exploit. The canoes came close almost to the shoar & there lay parle[y]ing from 6 a clock till tenn. There was 3 or 4 canoes came ashoar to the Dutch Castle, & so went to the fleet again. The true narrative of this bussiness I cannot learn, some say that Little Taggee was to fight Great Taggee, & the Mine cannoes came to fig[h]t John Cabess & Comenda people, others say they heard John Cabess was gone into the country & that they came to fight Comenda, but hereing he was here were afraid to come ashoar, some say one thing & some another, but however I thought good to advise your Worships what I could. It is credibley reported that when this fleet joyn'd at Abrebee, besides the 50 that came downe to Comenda, there went thirty canoes to Shumah & landed. What their intention is we know not. A[t] tenn a clock these cannoes that lay at Comenda sett sayle & stood for the Mine.
PS. The canoes I writt went for the Mine went but to Ampenny, & are now come back againe. We haveing seen a shipp all this day off in the offing which we do imagine may be a Dutch ship comeing here, I hope your worships will be pleased to sent powder & men. This comes by one of the Companys slaves per land, by reason no canoe will goe, being about 2 a clock at noone [= in the afternoon]."
2004,3,366,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,22/01/1696,Fort,RAC,"In my last I gave you an accompt of a fleet of the Mine cannoes, which went by land by one Companys slave names Breaney. The canoes are still lying here, some at Shumah, some at Comenda & others at Ampenny, ready to panyar any that shall make their escape by sea in case Little Taggee should prove victorious, which John Cabess credibly informed he is to fight Great Taggee on Sunday next, & so to come to Commenda & turne the English from thence, & that the king of Saboe is assisting to him, John Cabess desiring you would be pleased to send for the king of Saboe, for without his aide Little Taggee can do nothing. We are here in a verry sad posture of defence, haveing no victualls, the fishermen being all run into the country & the woman, & no caske to put water in, few men & the most sick, in a manner nothing, no orders what we must do in any case whatsoever. I would desire your Worships to send us powder, men, water cask & provisions with your orders as soon as possible can be, which I hope will be tomorrow.
PS. I have neither paper nor ink to write any more."
2005,3,367,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,23/01/1696,Fort,RAC,"Yours I recieved with the caske of water, one barrell powder, tenn lead barrs, and shall follow the contents of your letter to the utmost of my power. I have sent what carpetts I have left with the corrall. I have likewise sent some slaves as underwritten. We are beleagurad all about with Dutch cannoes to panyar who they can, as people certain of victory. Most of our town people have desarted us to them selves. As I writ you word before, once more I hope your Worships will be pleased not to forgett us, but by all means to send us man, come & more armes, without which it will be impossible for us to maintaine the Companys fort. Their is no trusting to blacks, I can assure you these slaves I have will leave us if it comes to the pash [= push], for they gramble [= grumble] already, and say they want victualls. It would be incouragement likewise to the men if youl send a doctor. I am say are more [= will say no more], but leave all to your Worships consideration."
2006,3,368,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,26/01/1696,Fort,RAC,"You must contrive som[e] way or other to gitt us of. John Cabess is gone and all the people. Whe [= we] have noe corne nor nothing to subsist on [ms. 'one']. They panyard the great canoe this morning and panyard all your canoes, and now the town people are gone. I doe suppose we shall have the dam'd people upon us, who I am afraid will give us no quarters, and their will be no way for us to make our escape. This morning John Cabess sent a _ barrell powder to the King of Aguaffo with tenn lead bars."
2007,3,369,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,31/01/1696,Fort,RAC,"Yours I received at the camp, and according to order went with all speed back to Commenda, where we found William Reeves and Richard Braywood, whom whe left there, who by reason of their infirmities were not able to go, so did designe to gett them passage in a canoe the next morning, but could not by any means procure one, tho they proffered never so much, yet with notwithstanding their stay the blacks have stole allmost everything. Now you cannot be unsensable that we have no powder nor anything in the Castle, only a runlett I gott for [= from] the king, for which I must pay him half a barrell the first powder you send. For my part I have lost all I had. I wish the corne hath come before the letter Coffee brought. The Company hath lost some goods. Coffee hath given you an accompt how we dispose of them, a further accompt you shall have when you send me ink and paper. You may now supply with what you please, the seas being clear, the Dutch canoes being all gone. Pray doe not pay the canoes for I pay them here."
2008,3,370,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,07/02/1696,Fort,RAC,"Yours I received of the 4th instant, with eight pieces of pork with [= weight?] 32 lb & 90 lb of flower. The canoe men say he was plundered a little of the Mine, by a Shuma canoe bound thither, who opened the anchors, suspecting it to be powder, & took some peices of the porck away. Wee have daily expected aide from your worships either by sea or land but find none. I have often sent to you for men & powder, we haveing not above 40 lb in the fort. Here we live pend [= penned] up, knowing nothing, niether intelligence from camp or court, and in daily expectation of the Miners or some other people to sett upon us, & when there will be no way for us to escape, & pray consider what a condition wee are in to fight, which wee must doe to the last. I hope you will be pleased to send up forthwith men, powder and match. The Dutch have a great many white & abundance of blacks alwaies in arms about their fort. Wee are all so lame with our late journey that wee are hardly able to stir. All our towns people are gone, some to one place & some to another; wee have not so much as any body to bring us any news, since the town people are gone. It is almost incredible to report the abundance of ratts we have, that wee cannot lye in our cotts a night but with sticks in our hands to kill them."
2009,3,371,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,13/02/1696,Fort,RAC,"On the 10th instant arrived here the Fauconberg, Capt. Browne, he came to an anchor in a great offin gunshott without [= outside] the Dutch Gaily. The 11th instant [he] went to send a few canoes ashoar, who were interposed by the Dutch canoes and so was forced to putt aboard againe, and so ever since then she hath layn without any action. I was very eager to know what orders he had for us, and working all the stratagims I could to perswade a canoe to goe of, which by fair words and great rewards I gott a canoe two nights together to putt of, but [it] was afraid and so putt ashoar againe. The 12th instant I gott a canoe that went aboard and came safe ashoar againe, in which I wrote for a barrell of powder, & the Captain sent me a barrell of powder, a little biskitt & 2 peices of beef with your letter. As for the ship we know there was one att Cabo Corso, and their she might have stayed for any service she will doe us. He might have landed the first or second day if he would have man'd his boats, the Dutch thinking we had some force in our towne, but since the Dutch being of great strength, haveing about a hundred men in armes ransacking about our towne, & about 40 small canoes att sea, that it would be hard for us if the goods were landed to secure it in the fort, haveing no body in our towne to assist us. As for your six black soldiers [they] are a thing of nothing, for if they were ashoar they would not stay with us two minutes but would be scampered into the woods, and indeed what doe six signifie? I reckon in a day or two more they will not suffer us to fetch any water. If your worships had sent 10 or 12 white men & about 30 or 40 blacks, it had been some incouragment, with a supply of powder & provitions, yett your worships may stand by us yett, only delays are dangerous. Send to the King of Aguaffo to send down 40 or 50 soldiers, & the Captain of ship to man but one boat will scare all the Dutch canoes, that they will not come near him, for they are a parcell of cowardly doggs. This 12 instant came likewise here 140 Adoomes Shrevys [men], and went to the camp to aid Little Taggee. And as for the slaves, I would send them aboard if I could, but cannot so much as gett 2 two hand canoes if I would give a mark of gold, and [how] I shall send this letter I know not.
PS. Pray send possitive orders if I shall fire if they oppose our landing."
2010,3,372,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,19/02/1696,Fort,RAC,"Yours I received last night with one cheese and a peice sowes beef, some bread, but as yett have not weighed it, but noe powder, I believe the King keeps that for the small runlett wee had of him, which when we opened was not _ full, not above 20 lb, all which is to no purpose, it is men, men, men and powder that I for this two months together have writt for, but to noe effect, & told you the necessity & the desperatness of our condition, haveing not a man for ever[y] flancker & most of them sick, as the other day when a turnadoe blew very hard


 and two canoes coming of from Capt Browne, the Dutch Generals fleet being ashoar dare not putt of, made all the force they could & came out of our side, thinking to have seized them ashoar, fired two or 3 small gunns att the fort, wee firing one great gunn & severall small armes made them retreat, our two malatoes Browood & Tyger standing trembling & would not fire a gunn at their countrey men if you would hang them. The people say you make sure of the Companys concernes as their goods & slaves &c, tho they signifie nothing to us, it is white soldiers & black solders wee want, they might as well have come by land as it was proposed for as to goe downe by land. The Dutch have store of whites & black, but what doe I say any more for when to no purpose? I am doubtfull this may prove a second Succondee [ms. 'Secuccondee'] bussiness, who have not one black hear to assist us. Our men will come when it is to late.
PS. You will receive ninteen slaves. I would have sent 20 but by reason they are gone into the bushes for potatoes."
2011,3,373,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,27/02/1696,Fort,RAC,"This morning all the Dutch canoes were gone for the Mine, the Coast now being clear. If they returne not againe you may now furnish us with what you please, by night or I believe by day, for they have but one or two small canoes att the Dutch fort, provided they land not at the usuall landing place, but to windward. Wee are in great want of our pay; wee could now and then buy a taccoes worth of fish or petinoes &c, tho att dear rate. Your worships must not be pleased to stop their pay by any meanes, being nothing to be had without the penny, and besides they are indebted to mee somthing for the Companys goods, wee [have] four months pay each due. Wee want some musquetts, flints, small wier, small tackes, two or three small long guimblets for clearing the vents of the great gunns, a skin or two to cover the spunge staves &c. Wee have a discourse here that the two Tagees are making up the pallaver, whether true or false I know not, wee haveing so many uncertaine reports. Wee received the provisions from the camp, but rest according to your letter as you will find under written, but no powder.
76 lb bread
65 "" beefe
30 "" cheese"
2012,3,374,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,03/03/1696,Fort,RAC,"This by return of the canoe that brought the powder &c, all being received according to the contents of your letter excepting the corne, which could not be two chests, being but four small basketts. The canoe men I believe play'd the rogue with it. I would not have paid them, but considering I should not gett a canoe another time and the come was very well accepted, being very scarce here, and none to be bought. The first corne I received from your worships was divided amongst us all, the corne I received from Capt. Browne I gave to the slaves, being then 27. The slaves begin to want their pay, telling me every day they are hungry. If you[r] worships would order us I would pay them, their being but eight of them and four months pay due to each &c, or send the money, with the white mens pay. I can advise your worships of no news. Here is great preparation for war, getting all the forces they can together. The Dutch spare for no cost, sending to all the people round about, but I think to little effect as I can hear, but I know not how I should hear of anything, for wee have nobody hardly comes near us, from on[e] place or other. The Dutch are very strong here, haveing a great many white men and black soldiers and a good fort. Wee on the contrary have but few white men, & not above ten old blacks, and four canoe men in the towne, & an open fort, which well mand [= manned] with water and provition enough would be sufficient. Your worships will consider and furnish us 4with men and some empty water cask, wee having but six punchings (= puncheons] of water. Pray send by next opportunity, if no flints a flint stone, 3 or 4 lead bars, if wee should have occasion a bottle of sweet oyle for musketts, one or two hour glasses, the ratts haveing broke ours, that wee have none to stand sentry by."
2013,3,375,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,10/03/1696,Fort,RAC,"Yours received with the gold, wanting an angle of weight, but nothing else, and by the return of the canoe have sent downe the Companys three says and one blankett. As for the peice and _ of narrow bafts, I lett the men have it to make shirts, which [they] must [be] accomptable for. The says were all damaged and soe are these. The other night came a great parcell of the Addoomes, wee could see them by the moonlight, but not to tell what quantity. Their horns played a pretty while at the Dutch fort, and so went for Little Taggees camp. Last Sunday wee heard in the night a great many small peices goe off, as if they were but at a small distance. In the morning wee see about 12 or 14 blacks att a good distance as far as wee could see, which on a suddaine they all vanished into the bushes, soe wee see them no more that morning. I charged the blacks not to goe out of the towne, upon no accompt whatsoever. Notwithstanding one of them went to gett potatoes named Shadue, who I belive is panyard with some of the townes people, by Little Taggees [people], who sworme about here, there was this morning I believe, about 60 or 70 at the Dutch fort. The slaves will now be starv'd if you doe not forthwith send some corne, likewise wee have not provisions to serve us above 4 or 5 days longer. The seas are clear, here is only the Dutch Galley riding here, but they panyar no canoes, wee have one or two canoes goes a fishing every day, which goes of and comes in att the Dutch landing place, without any stop or hinderance. The corne Mr Salmon sent last was so nasty nobody could eat it, but as hunger forc't &c.
PS. This afternoon the Dutch galley [went] to the Mine. If your worships would be pleased to send some beef & pease it would be very well, for it is cold weather and wee have a great deale of raine here &c. For the slaves I know not what they will doe."
2014,3,376,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,16/03/1696,Fort,RAC,"Yours received with the cask of pease and 2 basketts of corne (which is a poor medicine for seamen & slaves), it cannot serve above two days longer, wherefore you will doe well in sending more corn and bread for the white men, for here is not a bite of anything to be had but what comes from your worships. It can never be that two little basketts, and them not full, can be a chest of corn. Wee have that chest here, but should I measure it I am sure their would not be halfe a chest. Mr Salmons may be small, but never soe small. These canoe men have play'd the rogue with the slaves and townes people corn, they sold two basketts, one to the white men, the other in the towne. The towne canoe men says when they fetch corn from Annamaboe, they have 3 basketts and halfe in a chest. Mr Salmon would doe well to send word how many basketts. I am advised that the Companys slaves is sold at Suma with two more of this towne by an old man that was panyard with them, who was likewise carried with them, but as he reports the Copeman, being in hast to goe to Succondee about some bussiness, bid them bring him another time, so he made his escape, but I rather think it was he being an old man and unfitt for bussiness the Copeman would not buy him, and so might make his escape, as they have served severall here that have been panyard, the Copeman seemed to be angry and chid them, saying who gave you orders to panyar these poor people, saying goe goe father or mother, such sort of inveagling deceitfull ways they use, when [they are] so old and decriped [= decrepit], with shakeing heads, unfitt for any service in the world, not worth a canky. He further relates of a two hand canoe that was bound for Dickies Cove, the Copeman of Succondee sent a canoe of & brought her in, which was fraigthted with two barrells of powder and twelve muskitts, they were carried to Suma, where your letter or letters were opened and read, and so for the Mine &c. I am glad to hear that Great Taggee is so strong.
PS. Now the old man says they were sold at Adoomes Sherreys croome and that only he was carried to Suma as I writt before &c. Wee have heard a great many small arms fired towards the camp, both in the morning and the evening."
2015,3,377,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,19/03/1696,Fort,RAC,Yours received with the four chests of corne.
2016,3,378,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,20/03/1696,Fort,RAC,"This morning att six a clock wee heard them begin their fight, and about eight Little Taggees camp wee see on fire. Att four a clock came a great parcell of Great Taggees people, who brought in the joyfull tidings of Great Taggees victory, of which I was heartily glad. Here's abundance of them, and likewise their is a great many of them gone to the Dutch fort that fled from the camp, amongst which they say the Adoomes Shrevy and Captain Dick. The Accromes and Great Taggees people together are come to catch them if they can. The Dutch fort fires att all the blacks that comes to our fort. I am att great charge with them both with powder and liquor. In hast."
2017,3,379,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,23/03/1696,Fort,RAC,"This is by a canoe that John Cabess sends to buy him corn, att his request to give you an accompt that this morning att eight a clock he came here, and doth intend to stay, would desire you to send him some beefe and brandy. I would desire your worships to send some more slaves to thatch the factors house & likewise the fort, for wee lie open to the air, nothing but the heaven for our canopy, wee haveing pulled all the thatch work downe for fear it should have been fired by our enemies, and now the raines are comeing on, wee have but seaven slaves to doe the forts work. John Cabess would have you send him _ a barrell of powder to give to his men."
2018,3,380,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,24/03/1696,Fort,RAC,"This goes by returne of your canoe, by whom I received one chest, the other they4 keep their by reason the sea runs so high they could not take it in. I hope your worships doe not pay the canoemen that come from me, for I have paid them all along here, but of that gave you a caution in two letters before. I can advise you but of very little how affaires goes. That day the fight was. as I write you before, here came about two hundred of the Kings soldiers, when att the same time wee see from as far as Ampeny about a hundred blacks comeing upon the sands towards the Dutch fort, came very softly along, they were people that run from the camp for but very few had armes. Had the Kings soldiers came by the sea side they might have secured a great many of them, but they came out of the countrey hallowing and fireing as if they had been mad. There was not two minuites difference in their coming. The Dutch blacks just gott to their fort, the Kings people all enquireing after Addoome Sherrey in whom they were in pursuite. The poor people were very much tired with fighting and pursuing all that day. I gave them an anchor of Barbadoes rumm, and they beg soe heartily for powder, telling me they had none, and that they were going to Adoomes Sherreys croome, where there was a hundred gone before, that kept up along the countreys, that I was forc't to give them some, soe they lay downe till eleven a clock att night, then went for Adoomes Sherreys croome, but I can here of noe great exploits they have done their, only burnt one or two little ajacent croomes, and brought away some corne, that is some few of them that are come away, the rest remaine their still. His croome is on an island, and that they cannot gett at itt without canoes, being very deep, so I suppose they may have belagured it. John Cabess as I wrote you before is come downe here, haveing about a hundred soldiers, few of them Commenda people, or his own, but most of them the Kings people, and Abonds [= Abon's], All things are seemingly att quiet here, John Cabess according to his order, sending up and downe to adjacent croomes, willing the people to return to their habitations, and due [= do] allegiance to their King, & that now since the King had conquered his enemies, they might enjoy what they had in peace and quietness. Whether they doe this out of policy to trappan [= trepan] the people, or whether to wrong the fort of his people, I am not able to judge, but certaine it is a great many of his people are revolted from him, and went to Little Taggee both from this towne and all the adjacent croomes, whome they all did hope would prove conqueror. Both battalions stood to it bravely, their fell that day a great many men, here is a great many men killd of Commenda that I know. The Dutch are now as mute as mutton, keeping all very close within their fort.
PS. Pray send some paper for I have not a bitt."
2019,3,381,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,26/03/1696,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday being the 25th instant I had an embassador from the Dutch fort, to tell me that the Copeman had these orders from the Generall, to tell me that they meant us no ill will or to doe us any harme, but if the blacks would not lett their slaves fetch wood and water peaceably and quietly they had orders to bum the towne, and hop't wee would have nothing to doe with it, to which I answered wee had no ill will to them, nor nothing to say to them, but that the towne belonged to the English, but that mattered not, he had best follow his Generalls orders, I had nothing to say to them. So I dranck to the man in a dram, as being a white man, & soe was going from him. He still urged me that I would speake to the blacks to lett their slaves goe and come in quiet, I told him wee had no pallaver neither with whites or blacks, and I had nothing to say in it, neither would it be prudent in me to meddle or make up, the people being exasperated against them, that they were the Kings people, strangers to mee, whom I had never seen in my life before, and that he had better redress [= address] himself to John Cabess. Why, says the man, is he here? I told him yes. He askt me that over three times, if he was here, I told him yes, & bid my boy call him, then the man began to be afraid and would have been gone, I bid him stay and told him nobody should hurt him here, as he came with a message to me he should return safe to his fort. John Cabess came not himself, but sent a Cabosheer that came downe along with him from the King, to whom the man said he had nothing to say to him, but that he came with a messige from his master to the English serjeant, [and] withall rehearseth the story he told mee. When the Cabbosheer heard him talk of burning the towne he was in such a rage that he could not utter himseif at present, but spiteing [= spitting] on the ground with derision, and said what and all we here, lett him come. He told the man all this ground was Abba Taggees, and that the Dutch had nothing to do with it, and how they dare be soe impudent to ask them for water, when they had raised a warr against them, and would have cutt them off, so bid him stay, and he went out to John Cabess, so when he came in againe, he asked him what made them sue for water when they were so strong that they threatned to bum the towne, but however told him they mattered not a little water, they might send their slaves and fetch it, but that a great many of their men was in the bushes, and if they were panyard they must not blame him for it, so with this answer the man wen[t], and had the satisfaction of seeing John Cabess as he went out of the gate, who sat under a pallavering house, to whom the man pulled of his hatt and bowed very low. The Copeman sent two canoes away to the Mine within halfe an hour, I suppose to tell the Generall his answer, and that John Cabess was here, but however I have seen no slaves fetch water. The Copeman when he sent the bold message little thought we were so strong, or that John Cabess was here. His embassador would have eat his words, saying the Copeman only bid him say so but did not intend to doe it. The meaning of my writing to [your] worships is to have your possitive orders, should they attempt any such thing, which I am pretty well assured they dare not. They are afraid before they are hurt, I see nobody that opposeth them, but all still and quiet.
PS. Pray send me some paper & inck."
2020,3,382,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,28/03/1696,Fort,RAC,"This by a canoe that was coming to Cabo Corso about some bussiness, may acquaint you I received yours of the 26 & 27 instant, the former with the halfe barrell of powder, a case of spiritts, six peices of beef, John Cabess with his people being gone the night before to a croome hard by, to make some pallaver, and told me he would returne back on Sunday next, but ordered the aforesaid things to be sent to him, which was accordingly. The latter shall observe the contents, but received no rumm."
2021,3,383,Thomas Wilson,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,31/03/1696,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday being the 30th instant about nine a clock in the morning came here from the Mine about 140 Adoomes going home to their countrey, they having a white flagg with them, they made a small stay at the Dutch fort, and so went their way. In their going they unfortunately litt upon the Royall Company's slaves, who were fetching wood, and have panyard three of them. Ther[e] was no thought that day of any danger, most of the towne went that morning to the ajacent croomes to fetch come. The Adoomes keep the exact path and went to Shamma. About an hour [later] John Cabess came. It was well they litt not of him, for he had not above twelve men with him. He saith if you will give him orders he will panyar some of the Dutch slaves. On Sunday next he doth intend to be with you at Cabo Corso. These Adoomes are a great plague to the King and John Cabess, haveing a great many of their women and will not lett them goe.

2022,3,384,John Rootsey,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,06/04/1697,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 30th March last by the 7 hand canoa and 13 ditto loaden with come have received, also 30 countrey boards, one role sheet lead and brads by the Sally Rose. I hope to have the Swallow here suddenly, for the shells that came from on board the former will doe no more then build the outer walls of our tanck, which in two days designe to begin, if no raine comes. By the bearer Serjeant Thomas Willson have sent my accompts and ballance, being 6oz 13a 2ta cra cra gold for Annamaboe Factory. My suddaine removall from thence here, and the indisposition of my body, the care of the building, and the warr is the reason of my not sending them before, but I hope to be excused because I before sent you a ruff draught of them, which you returned to me, and ordered duplicates to be sent, which now comes by the bearer [ms. 'prier']. I cannot conveniently draw out accompts for this place by reason know not the mens pay due to them (or each of them), but have supplyed them with money to serve their occations, tho have not called to a generall pay. I had last week some Cuffra men down, whos[e] business was to take fetiche with John Cabess that no traders or their goods should be panyard that came downe here (on mens heads that owed John Cabess money), which after had passed on both sides, the Cufferas promised to be downe in fifteen days. John Cabess hath sent a man with him into the Cuffera countrey to take a fetich for him, which pallaver I now perceive is the reason I have sold but five perpetuanoes and a chest and a halfe of sheets of the goods you sent me, but now in all probability I shall have a vast trade, not only thence but from the Addoomes. Yesterday our cook, one of the five old slaves you ordered me to pay corne to, is mising. He went for wood, as the other slaves tell me, whether he run away because he was not paid as the others are or [is] panyard, I cannot tell. I sent the Bomboy and old slaves after him, also John Cabess soldier, who brought me word they trackd his footsteps over the salt pond towards the Dutch Fort. I then sent the Bomboy to know if he was there, and also to demand of him a child, which Little Taggees men had stole, and was in his custody, or he could procure, as he sent me word by his boy with his cane, but when the Bomboy came to the Castle gate he was stop'd (the like he never did before) and the Copeman sent me word that he had or knew of [n]either of them, and sent me word I should take what followed if I sent anybody to his Fort againe. The reason I suppose [is] that three of his soldiers run away from his Fort, and perhaps mistrust me that I intice them, but I hear they are gone to the Mine for want of food there. Shall want boards to turn the arch of the tanck, and 1000 20d, 10d & 6d nailes, some countrey match, wedges to break stone, and maules."

Pepperell and to what time, for certainly there is a very great mistake, which your worshipps are not informed off, for on the 19 October 1696 I received an ounce of Mr Salmon, the 28 November at our comeing for Commenda [omission?], and since about Christmas another ounce sent me here to Commenda, and then at pay table Doctor Jackson received for me 3oz 12a 10ta. [of] which 6oz 12a 10ta the six angles one taccoe might be due to him [i.e. Salmon] for provitions, but I allways understood the money I received of Mr Salmon by your worshipps order had been part of my wages, but he has stop'd it from Doctor Jackson out of 3oz 12a 10ta, soe I am certaine that is the mistake, which I suppose your worshipps did not know of, therefore I most humbly desire your worshipps will be pleased to lett me have a right understanding, and I shall for ever as in duty bound pray for your worships good success.

Pepperell and he can give you an exact accompt of the bigness of our tanck, which in my opinion is not to large. Those that informed you I made it larger then the fort requires, should have consulted with me or had soe much reason to consider the illness of ground, which caused the hole to be made slopeing and soe wide on the supersition [= supposition].

The old Dutch Copeman is sent to the Mine, and their bookholder is come Copeman. The surveyor wants the ironwork to break stone, and the Gunner some countrey match.

2028,3,390,Gerard Gore,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,10/05/1697,Fort,RAC,"In pursuance to your orders of the 6 instant received into my possession the Royall African Company of Englands fort and factory at Commenda with all the goods, merchandizes, gunns, stores, amunition &c, as will appeare by the inclosed inventory, and with me by the Sally Rose I received 100 blue perpetuanoes, and one cask knives mentioned to containe one hundred sixty six dozen. I desire youl be pleased to send me some tallow and some white blanketts, being enquired after here, and according to your order have sent Mr Gabb surveyor and two sawers on board the Sally Rose, tho shall mightily want him in two or three days, by which time the tanck will be finished to arching, which then can goe no further without his direction, I shall stand still for want of him, and that where he was a goeing, he said he could mark out and direct them in all things what shall be wanting and necessary, both for this place and Dickies Cove, in four or five days time, and that after his staying will be to no purpose and much to our hinderance here, and that in a day or twos time more wee must stand still, which will be much damage to what is begun, for wee can finish nothing without him, for he said if he found his staying would be to no purpose there, after he had given as much directions as needfull, would come here by canoa from thence, and that you'l please to send two or three barrells of tarris more, this being too small you have sent, will not near finish it.
PS. I desire you will send me accompt of the customs of this place, not knowing what it is, and also desire the goods above writte for may be good for encouragement of traders, here being a great talk of traders comeing speedily, and likewise the other inventory shall send by the first conveyance that offers."

'finfish'] it, but will make it goe as far as possible I can. I allso received by Capt. Piles seven and a quarter chests come which in my last I omitted to advise off. The reason was he not sending it before he was under saile, and would not measure it, nor did not care how or what he gave, which came very wett on shore, and late at night, I had noe oppertunity next day of drying it, by reason of the weather. Likewise as concerning the surveyor as you was pleased to write to me, twas not my fault, for Capt. Piles came on shore himself, which I told him I could not send nor spare without your orders, which he told me he had possitively from you for to send him, which I told him I must see before I lett him goe, which orders he told me had mislade and could not find them, and was mighty importunate for him and told me he wondered I should disobey your orders, tho' I must acknowledge it was my fault because I did not see them, but the Captain makeing such a great noise about him, I thinking it was so, and that I should disobey you if I did not send him, therefore I sent him, which I humbly begg your pardon in soe doeing, tho' hope I shall have no occation for him before he comes againe. I believe the tanck is not soe forward as you have been advised, but it will be this three days before it will be ready for arching, which I shall forward as much as possible I can, and all other things. The inclosed is a note of what carpenters tooles is wanting here, not haveing any such tooles here, which wee are at a great loss for, therefore desire they may be sent by first opportunity, also the iron work the surveyor gave orders for when he was at Cabo Corso last may be sent with them.
PS. The above mentioned goods (vizt the blanketts) are soe much damaged will not sell here at the price you write, and also the tallow, therefore desire you will send me at what rates I shall dispose of them. I also desire you would be pleased to send by the next some powder for the Forts use, haveing here but 4 _ barrells powder, as is by inventory, which will not be sufficient for this Fort, in case we should have occation. Also by the next I desire you will send five yards canvas.

2031,3,393,William Gabb,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,17/05/1697,Fort,RAC,"According to your worshipps order have been at Cape Tres Pointas, with two sawyers from Cape Coast and the two sawyers I had here, and with much adoe gott six slaves at Dickies Cove, Mr Vincent was not willing to lett me have any, but with these I have cutt down six trees, which make near fifteen load of timber, at fifty feet per load, propper for what wee shall want hear or Cape Coast. I have cutt all off in length and squared six or seven load, and sunk a saw pitt and lined it out fitt for sawing, and gave directions to the slaves to cutt it out in scantling, fitt to be carried on board. I likewise told Capt. Piles what was best to be done with the timber and desired he would lett his carpenters mate or any one white man to see the slaves did what I ordered them about the timber, but he would not, and both the Captains sware neither of their men should put a hand in order to gett downe the timber to the sea side. Capt. Pepperell sayed he will carry but very little timber, and especially no heavy peices, he spoke of tarrying there two months. Capt Piles did intend to saile thence in eight or tenn dayes, but now he is vexed he must tarry for the other, and say none of his men
shall help him. There is a great deale of as good timber as any upon the Coast, of two feet diamiter and downwards, but I doubt unless your worships send more slaves, and some white men to see the timber cut out according to orders, that the shipps will bring away but little, and there is enough cutt close to that which may be gott with little trouble. I have cutt the poles ordered by Capt. Piles. Capt. Pepperell desired me to acquaint your worshipps he expected a seven hand canoa, and if he have none cannot gett his wood on board his boat, for they ride at grapling and cannot gett away att the Brandenburgh Castle. The slaves have no corne, nor is there any to be bought in the countrey, else I had bought them some, for they cannot work without it. I came from thence a Fryday in the afternoon, it was late a Saterday night before I gott to Commenda, because of bad weather. Yesterday the raine hindred the canoa from goeing. Our masons have been to extravagant of their tarris in my absence, it is all gone and the tanck is not quite high enough to turne the arch, the bottom is not floored, therefore desire your worshipps would send downe three or four casks as soone as possible, that we may perfect it before the raines damage the walls too much. Our bricks prove very bad, they moulter away with the wett, and our masons have used parte I ordered for the arch. If a great canoa comes pray be pleased to send some well burnt. I will take care in all things committed to my charge.
PS. If any goe to helpe cutt timber they will want 2 or 3 broad axes and two cross cutt saws, that all may work. Wee want the iron work I desired, especially to break stone."
2032,3,394,Gerard Gore,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,18/05/1697,Fort,RAC,"Yours the 17 instant I have received, with one barrell of tarris and the carpenters tooles therein mentioned, also 3 maules and six wedges, with a list of every mans pay except Anthony Martins, but the canvis and the iron work you writte me off I have not received, which I desire you will be pleased to send by the next, and also what things the surveyor wrote for the 17th instant, who there also advised you of what he had done to windward, and as for the tarris and what wee have here wee shall have used by this day night next, therefore desire you'l please to send as soon as possible two barrells more, which if wee have not cannot finish our tanck."

I am also sorry I should acquainte you of the misfortune that has happened to the 7 hand canoa, which about nine of the clock yesterday morning arrived here, about which time the wind began to blow very fresh, and was mightily troubled to send a canoa of to her, by reason the seas was soe very bad, which canoa in comeing ashore againe was broke all to peices, and as soon as I had received yours according to your order I endeavoured to send of the iron work that was left here by Capt Piles, but could not, the seas and wind being soe extraordinary bad nobody would venture, haveing soe bad an example before, and that the seaven hand canoa could not goe by reason of the weather, was forced to remove, and about 9 and 10 of the clock last night there came three of the canoamen on shore, which I sent for into the Castle, who said the canoa was broke all to peices by a thunderbolt, and all the rest of the men lost, and everything that was in her, and this morning makeing further enquiry and searching after the goods but have not as yet found any, but have found five of the canoamen and the canoa a great way upon the sand near the Dutch landing place, and not in the condition they said she was in, but has been broke in comeing ashore, and just now I have found the rest of the canoamen which they said was lost. I have secured them all and examined very strictly, I have threatened them very severely, and I believe they have played the rogue with the goods they had in her, and I find them all in severall stories, and I hope shall make them confess somthing, for I find some likelyhood of it, but all as I can gett out of them they say they came ashore at the Dutch landing place, and before said to windward of our Castle, and that they believe the Dutch has the goods, whereupon I sent to see, but they own nothing of itt, but I hope to find it other ways, for two I have whip'd at the gunn but cannot make them confess anything to the purpose, but hope shall by inflicting punishment on the rest, which by the next shall acquaint you more at large. In the mean time I write this to acquaint you how it is, that you may doe as you think convenient.
PS. The surveyor sayes that one barrell more will not be enough, but desires wee may have two, and also if a large canoa goes to Cape Tres Pointas for to send some well burned bricks in her for this place, he believing wee cannot finish the tanck without them."
2034,3,396,Gerard Gore,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,20/05/1697,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday I wrote you of the loss of the seven hand canoa, which I have examined in more stricktly, and in whiping the third man made him confess that four of the canoamen had carryed one case into the bushes a great way beyond the Dutch Fort when they went first with the canoa, but that man said he was not one of the four, but he was one that looked after the canoa, which four men he told me, whereupon I examined [them], but could not make them confess anything to the purpose, upon which I fastened two of them to the gunn, and began to whip them, but they would not confess what they had done with the goods, but they said they were beyond the Dutch Fort, but would not tell what they done with the goods, and believe the Dutch had them, but the Dutch would not own nothing, tho believe had some, for wee saw three slaves very busie upon the sands a great way beyond the Fort, tho' could not see what they brought with them, tho' I sett people to watch, and this canoaman that said there was a case carried away by the 4 canoamen, to find out the truth whether it was so or not, I made him show where he thought it might be laide, with whom I went myself above a mile beyond the Dutch Fort but found nothing in the bushes as I expected, but wee found the boards of one case, which the surveyor said was broke open with hands, and the boards of another case, some way beyond, all scattered up and down upon the sands, and upon one of the rocks found one single nicconee, and this morning by break of day sent more slaves, with a whiteman with them, hopeing they might find more, by reason the water was down, but could find nothing, and examineing of two which I had whiped before, bringing them to the gunn the second time, who said if I would lett them loose they could find some, which accordingly I did, and sent some slaves and the whiteman with them againe, who in one hours time brought me word they had found a great many and wanted more slaves to bring them home, which I sent and one white man more to take an accompt how many there was, which in bringing them home, the Dutch Copeman panyard and carried them into his Castle, which I sent to know his reason for itt, who said he did not know whether they were Dutch interlopers goods or not, which was all his reason, and in the afternoon I mett him halfe way between the Forts, but he was still in the same story, which I told him his argument was very weak in that respect, and that I gave him sufficient reason to the contrary of that, and made it known to him that they were English Companyes goods, which then he said he had orders from the Generall of the Mine to seize of all things that came near, anything that belonged to the English, tho' he and I have had a faire correspondence one with another, and that yesterday I sent to lett him know beforehand that they were our slaves that were comeing, and what business they went upon, and he sent word to me againe that any body that belonged to me should goe any whether [= whither] without his medling with them, and [he] did not. but paid his respects to me both in comeing and goeing, and he beg'd my excuse because he did not give me invitation into his Castle comeing by, because it was his Generalls orders, and as before mentioned, and in friendship to me he lett us doe what wee did, which he desires I would be secrett in, and as concerning the goods I told him I was sorry that he had done what he had done, for I told him he must be accomptable for everything that was in the canoa, for what slaves did not find he took from ours, which was, as the man I sent took an accompt of them, forty one whole nicconees in whole length and fifty seven peices in severall lengths, and that the Dutch had this day a small canoa from the Mine, by whom he has sent to acquaint the Generall of what he has done, whose answer he shall have tomorrow; which when comes he will send me word what it is, which I desire your orders for my further proceedings, whether wee shall take them or not, or send for them if he sends me word."
2035,3,397,Gerard Gore,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,25/05/1697,Fort,RAC,"As I wrote you of the 20th and 21st instant the next day the Dutch had a canoa from the Mine, who I believe had a severe check from the Generall for what he had done, for he has sent to me severall times to send for the goods againe, and that he was mighty sorry for stopping them, who I sent word againe that I had sent to acquaint you of it, and that I could doe nothing before I had heard from you. Also acquainting you that wee have used all the bricks, and have not finished the arch of our tanck, but want halfe a days work to finish it, and that wee must now stand still for want of bricks, which I desire you'l be pleased to send with all speed a great canoa loading about three thousand well burnt bricks, or more if the canoa can carry them, and here is above four thousand of what has been sent not being halfe burnt are washed all to sand, which if had been good should have had noe occasion for more. Also desire you will send with the bricks two barrells of tarris, also the iron work, powder and canvas formerly wrote for by the 13 instant. Also acquainting you that cask of knives which I received by the Sally Rose, haveing occation to open for saile, find some much damaged with rust, and would not sell at 10 per a, tho' have disposed of a few at that price, and that if I would have sold them at 12 per a believe might have sold them all, which if you approve desire you would send me word by the first. Also acquainting you that here is severall white men very sick, especially my Serjeant and Gunner, who lies very sick and weak. I myself have been very sick this 4 days, but thank God pretty well recovered, tho know not how long shall continue soe, therefore desire you will be pleased to order some medicines by the first, our Doctor here haveing nothing to give us in our sickness, and that he tells me he has wrote to the Doctor severall times for what medicines he wants, therefore desire you would order Doctor Jackson to send some thing of what he wrote for, or what he thinks most needfull, our Doctor here not haveing over much knowledge in phisick, I believe.

Since my writing this some of our townes people being by the salt pond gathering musells of from the rocks, the Dutch fired a shott at them, which I sent to know what it was for, he told me it was his Generalls order that none should come near his landing place, as he said they were, that he knew them to be John Cabess people, and they were none of our Companyes slaves, if they had would not have fired, tho he told me it was his Generalls order to fire at all, which he told me at our first meeting, and desired I would not lett our slaves come near the salt pond, which I told him againe they must be about their business in digging stone, and that if he fired at them, he and I must fall out, and that he must lett no
blacks out of his fort, which I believe has cast some terror upon him, for our slaves has been where they could not goe formerly, both digging stone and cutting wood, and that if he should fire at our slaves at any time, desire your orders whether I shall fire, if light of the same opportunity."
2036,3,398,Gerard Gore,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,26/05/1697,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 24 instant with two barrells tarris by the 2 hand canoa have received, which will be sufficient to finish our tanck, and as to the return of the goods panyard by the Dutch Copeman, I wrote you of the 21st instant to know if I should receive them if he sent me such word, as [he] has severall times, as I wrote you yesterday. I have here according to your orders sent you an accompt of all the Royall Companys slaves that are here. Paul Read as I wrote you yesterday lyeing very sick and weak is not able to walk out of his roome, or else according to your orders should have sent him by this canoe, but if recovers if you approve of it I will send him, and as concerning the canoamen I am sorry that you have not approved of my punishment upon them, which was but on three, but had I not took these methods, you would never heard of any of the goods, but they told me a parcell of lies, that there came a thunderbolt and split the canoa all to peices, and that three men were drowned with the canoa, and that they were almost halfe way to Shuma. This they told me thinking I would enquire no further into itt, and that I thought it was all truth they told me, and that accordingly it was plotted before what they should say, and their three canoamen that they said were lost were hidd, and could not be found for a great while, and that the first I whiped said the English did not use to whip canoamen for takeing care of their goods, and that it was done by thunder and they could not help it, but I saw to the contrary of that before I whiped any, by the canoa which was broken in comeing on shore, which in whiping the second and third men they all confessed the truth, and said they were goeing on shore at the Dutch landing place, which was not their business, for they might have been halfe way at Dickies Cove, or at least ways keep out to sea, then all the goods had been saved, but they had certainely a minde to play the rogue with the goods, as I believe they have with part of them, for one of the canoamen confessed soe, as I wrote you by the 21 instant. I have also with the enclosed sent you an accompt of the iron work we want, which the surveyor gave the finish orders for when he was at Cabo Corso Castle last. The bricks yesterday wrote for desire wee may have with all speed, wee standing still for want of them.
PS. I have returned by this canoa 2 iron crows broak, 6 ditto wedges 3 ditto mawles."
2037,3,399,Gerard Gore,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,31/05/1697,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 25 instant I have received. Also by the 13 hand canoa about seven thousand bricks, which was not according to expectation, but thought should had enough by the canoa to finish our tanck, according as I wrote you by the 25 instant, and that believe with our good management these wee have received will be sufficient to finish our tanck, which we shall doe I hope in halfe a days time more, and that desire you would be pleased to send as soon as possible about two thousand more, for the pavement of our tanck within side, which we mightily want, and that if we had these bricks before might have finished our tanck before this time. Also acquainting you that we have been at a great deale of troublle in getting these bricks ashore, by reason wee have but three canoas here and that they would not venture for fear of breaking and that the canoa being so large could not come above halfe way ashore, before [= in front of] the Dutch, and then forced to put back againe, and that on Saturday night and last night they gott them all ashore at the Dutch landing place. Therefore desire you would send me a good small canoa or two, for if I should have never soe much occation for one they will not goe of here except the sea be extraordinary good indeed, nor that they will goe off a fishing for themselves, and that if I should have occation when they are fishing, have no canoa, which desire you will be pleased to consider. I am sorry that you are pleased to write me I must lett my knickknackes alone, which truly I am altogether a stranger too, for all my care hitherto since I have been here has been for the Royall Companyes interest, in promoteing the forwardness of the Castle, and shall be till finished, if please God to bless me with life and health, and truely I am not mindfull of such thing yett a while. You also write me word that I gave you no accompt whither I have received the nicconees from the Dutch, which if you recall mine of 21st instant you will find at the latter end where I wrote possitively to know your pleasure whether I should send for them, if they sent me such word, as I also wrote you of the 25 and 26 instant, which truly I expected your orders before for my receiveing them, which as soone as [I did] I sent for them, which as I wrote you before of the 21 instant [are] fourty one in whole lengths and fifty seven in peices of severall lengths, all in a very bad condition, by reason they have been in the sea, and that I am not well but thank God on the mending hand, and that I cannot give noe better discription of them as yett, but will take such care that they be looked after as may be, and by next to give you a better accompt of them. I also by the first desire some powder for Forts use, haveing formerly wrote you for some. I also desire that what you send for the future to send by seven hand canoas, and not bigger, by reason of our landing place, which may come without much danger. It is also my humble opinion that if wee should fire at the Dutch canoas here, in goeing and comeing from the landing place, that they would leave off fireing at ours, nor molest us in our landing there, which is without any danger, for which desire your orders, I holding it to be our just due, it being the better halfe way from the Dutch Fort. Paul Read still continues his sickness, or else I had sent him by the 13 hand canoa. You are also pleased to write me we have one woman slave more then you have an accompt of, which there is no more then ten women, nor never was here my time, as you will find by my inventory. Also acquainting that the 13 hand canoa went away without my knowledge, and that I thought she had more bricks in her then what was brought ashore the last night, but found to the contrary, and that I ordered them to carry the 7 canomen, they saying the canoa could not be mended, which since with some charge and a great deale of trouble have mended [and which] I sent by this.
PS. Understanding the Fauconbergh is come, desire you would be pleased to send by the first some sheets, which be the only means to bring traders downe hither, for John Cabess sayes they are mightily enquired for up in the countreys, and that the merchants cares not for comeing without they could gett some sheets, which will also be a great meanes for the dispatch of a great many other goods with them, and bring trade to the Castle, which has been but little yett, which I also begg you will be pleased to consider."
2038,3,400,William Gabb,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,01/06/1697,Fort,RAC,"According to Mr Gores order I have note of what smiths work is wanting for the use of this Fort. He since told me you called it part knick knacks, I suppose you mean those things mentioned for which I sent a pattern. My reason was because I know the smiths are not acquainted with work belonging to building, nor are they capeable in directing me in my business. I am sure to my knowledge there has not been the worth of a two penny naile converted to any other use then the Royall Companyes interest. I am heartily sorry wee are obliged to trouble your worshipps soe often for bricks. I have been as frugall of them, and all other materialls, as any man could have been, but those we had proved so very bad that above four thousand of them are not worth anything, and I cannot pretend to erect any building firmly without materialls proper for what they are to doe, therefore humbly begg you will be pleased to send two thousand of the best burnt bricks, for wee received not above 700, which have but just finished the arch. The seas has been soe very bad of late that the canoa durst not come on shore, and had no other then two hand canoas to unload her. Some went off in the day and sunk coming ashore, soe wee were forced to unload her in the night
at the Dutch landing place. Wee want about 1800 bricks to floor the tanck. besides some to make the passage for the water into and out of the tanck. Pray be pleased to send the iron work before wrote for, that wee may finish the work in hand, that wee may begin the other you have already ordered. Humbly begg wee may keep the deales I brought from Cabo Corso to make the center of the arch of the tanck, that when wee strick the center [omission], the boards for the staircase, and many other things, which I hope you will please to order part of the timber hither which I cutt at Cape Tres Pointas, which will be suitable for what we want, as I at present think off."
2039,3,401,Gerard Gore,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,02/06/1697,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 1st instant have received, and accordingly I have wrote you of the 31st past, thinking to have sent by the 13 hand canoa, who went away without my knowledge in the night, as I wrote you by the 7 hand canoa, which we have mended up againe and sent, whom I ordered to goe last night, but found by reason of the sea that runn here, went not before the morning, by whome I sent an accompt of the shipps that came into this road a Sunday last, and sailed last night from hence, and also sent an accompt of the good[s] received from the Dutch, and also what I therewith wrote for, desire you will be pleased to send if possible. Yesterday with scarcity of bricks finished the arch of the tanck.
PS. As above written the 7 hand canoa in goeing off was oversett and a little broke, which must be mended before can goe of againe, which shall send this day, but have sent the letter by this canoa."
2040,3,402,Gerard Gore,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,01/01/1000,Fort,RAC,"The enclosed letters were sent on shore from an English shipp that came into the road yesterday, who I sending to know what she was, who brought an accompt she was a permission shipp from the Royall Company named the Prosper, Capt. Hobman Commander, and this he desired the enclosed might be sent by the first, hee not knowing when he shall be at Cabo Corso Castle.
PS. Thinking the canoa would have been mended the last night I wrote accordingly, as which is mentioned, but the wanting soe much mending as wee have done extraordinary well, and not finished her before this night, or else would have been with you before, which I humbly begg you will be pleased to excuse."
2041,3,403,Gerard Gore,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,04/06/1697,Fort,RAC,"As I wrote you of the 2d instant that wee had finished our arch of our tanck, and used all our bricks, and can gett no further in our tanck for want of bricks, which desire you will be pleased to consider, and that wee may have some soe soon as possible, and also with the bricks some sheets, which will be the only meanes of bringing traid down hither, haveing had but little yett, and also some powder for the Forts use."
2042,3,404,Gerard Gore,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,27/06/1697,Fort,RAC,"With me by the seaven hand canoe of the 24th instant I received three spung staves, one hour glass, one scaine of marlin and one houslin, and some English match, gunners stores, and by this I have returned two firelock musquetts, one two hour glass, and one compas, good for nothing. Also by this according to your orders comes the surveyor, which desire you will nott detain, butt thatt you would be pleased to send him again as soone as posable, with all things necessary for the forwarding of the Castle.

By this I have returned one woman slave named Beshee, no.74, not being fitt for service, haveing lost one hand and the use of [the] other, and desire you would send more. Also the woman named Temawoll, 106, which you write me word was wanting, was panyard by the Guoffoes fetching of water the 11th of March last, the same time this woman lost her hand."

Allso you were pleased to write me that I have no occation to spend more powder than is allowed at other factoryes, which have not the occassion or half so much as this has, by reason of the station [= situation] as wee are in at this place, for wee cannot gett wood nor swish without the expence of powder, which I have putt downe the same quantity, tho before had not exprest the uses how it was expent. Allso for palme oyle the same, which am sure expend twice the quantity of any other factory, by reason are forct to bum severall lights every night. My dyett have rectyfied. and corne, mallagetta, salt &ca have charged less, and am sorry you were pleased to write me that such things is not allowed, neither done by any of my predicesors, tho am satisfied to the contrary, which truly think is very hard for slaves to worke all day long from sun riseing to sun setting, and have noe time nor liberty to look for any victualls, otherwayes live upon half a chest of corne a month, which will not suffice them but that I allow them a moderate allowance in reason as much as they can eat, which is more than what I have charged, and have not been wastfull of it, tho it is very bad come. Allso for mallagetta &ca, think it more reason for slaves as work as they doe than for bought slaves, which has cost me more than I have charged, and were they to be stinched [= stinted] of what they now have would not be able to doe halfe the service as they now doe, and the want of such things would soon kill them all, which I hope you will be pleased to take into consideration, and that shall be at more expence till such time as the fort is finished then afterwards will be required, which I will forward as much as possible, and that wee are some way in our foundation but wee shall be at a great want for more slaves, which desire you will be pleased to send with all expedition, or else shall be at great expence, in hireing the townes and John Cabbess's people to help us to digg and fetch our swish, which what slaves wee have here will not be able to fetch it as fast as it will be used, by reason it will be near a mile distance from the fort.

According to your orders would have sent my accompts to the last October, but not being very well at the beginning of this month, and having had then taken but little money, and considering having great expences this month, and having had since much trouble otherwise in minding and forwarding the building, have not had time to write them out, which humbly desire would be pleased to excuse, which if had not done would not have been as forward as it is, which the same forwardness shall continue till finished, and that this month being near ended will send my accompts to the end of this month, which hope will be time enough and be as well."
2054,3,416,Gerard Gore,Sekondi,,Cape Coast Castle,04/12/1697,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdayes date by two hand canoe have received, with the iron work therein mentioned. Also one of the crows you were pleased to write was according to the directions I sent, tho' much differing, tho' that received much more fitting for our work here then any that have had yett for our service, and according to directions, therefore desire that you would be pleased to order that the next may be made two foot longer, but no thicker, this being thick enough, but wanting in lenght, and that may have them as soone as possible, with the stone axes mentioned in the note sent per Thomas Covey, carpenter. The building shall forward as much as possible, with what assistance have here, and that hope in a fortnights time shall finish this flanker, and had wee had more slaves that flanker fronting the Dutch might a been as forward as that is, which desire would be pleased to send some lusty strong slaves to break stones, and that have imployed all the Black bricklayers this four months in breaking stones,
which if had other slaves might have imployed them otherwise, and that all that are imployed in breaking stones cannot break so many as to keep what white men doe work imployed, which for this six weeks have been but three, Lawrance Brindly having had so long a distemper in his hands, not being able to use them, but almost now well againe, and Joseph Reynor ever since been here has been so sick and weak, has done little or any worke; and that considering what assistance wee have are mightily forward in our building; and that have had great assistance both of John Cabess and towns people in fetching most of the swish wee have used, and that shall mightily want lime to pointe our walls with and build our battelements, which if have not in a fortnights time shall much want it, and stand still for want of it, which if not if have any raine, will much damnifie what have built, which humbly desire would be pleased to consider. Also that [you] would be pleased to send as soone as possible some good gunns, which wee shall much need, and that if would be pleased to send two or three good culverine and two or three dimme [= demi] culverine more, it would be absolutely necessary, it being built and designed so very strong that it is more fitting for some such gunns then any fort upon the Coast beside, and it standing so to the sea that there is not the like contrived Castle, for its biggness, upon the Coast, both for the defence of shiping and against an enemie, had wee gunns accordingly, which humbly desire would be pleased to take into consideration, which if have not some such as before mentioned, our building so strong will be insignificant. Therefore humbly desire that would be pleased to order Capt. Piles shipp hither with lime, and two or three good gunns, one or two of the above mentioned, which wee shall speedily want, which if have not so large will be to no effect, and it would be very convenient and strong against the Dutch, if should have any difference, and that the Dutch Coapeman here sayes when this flanker is finished, and have good gunns mounted there, that the Devill will not be able to stand against it, and that he much dreads it. Therefore humbly desire that [you] would before [you] send Capt. Piles shipp of the Coast, [send it] for this place with the afformentioned, and a flaggstaff and new fflagg, which wee much want, expecting every time these [we] have are made use of, to break downe.

the future that your Worshipps will not be pleased to credit noe more such false storys, and then hope shall not merrit your Worshipps displeasure in any thing, which shall be my endeavour. Had noe sooner dispatched my last away but that came to the Dutch here a great canoe, which brought them 20 chests of sheets, and that I was there yesterday, and see above twenty five chests of sheets, and likewise see his invoice which he had then came of all the goods he had in the Castle, and that the bales of his goods, wherein is charged iron barrs at 1a 6t each and other things cheaper then [you] are pleased to allow here, which makes a great many traders goe from hence thither, and that he has given great gifts to sundry Cabbosheers, which the Coapman told himselfe ordered by the Generall of the Mina. Therefore hope your Worshipps would be pleased to order me to give some dashes, or else it will be a mighty hinderance of trade to this place, severall Cabbosheers stopping the traders coming to the Castle and sending them to the Dutch, saying they have had noe dashes from the English to send traders, which hope your Worshipps will be pleased to take into consideration to allow something, not haveing yet allowed the custome which hath been always allowed for my first coming here, which hope now [you] will be pleased to allow, here being now a great towne and much people. Alsoe acquainting that traders will not give 4a for the tallow last sent, saying they can have the same of your Worshipps for 3a, which if are pleased to lett me sell them soe, could dispose of them a great quantity, traders saying that it is not worth more, it being a great deale smaller then them usually sould for four angles, which if your Worshipps approve to lett them goe at that rate, desire would send me as many as can spare more, and iron cheaper to send some quantity, here being severall traders here that wants more goods, iron and perpetuanoes then [I] have good here. Therefore desire would be pleased to send as by my last with all speed, and twenty iron barrs, John Cabbess saying he will perswade them if can to give more, telling them the difference between Dutch iron and English, but if are pleased to allow them cheaper desire would be pleased to send more.

With this goes Thomas Farmer, who being sick (and here without a Doctor), on his desire have sent him up to have some blood taken from him if the Doctor shall think fitt, hopeing in a few dayes he will be in a condition to returne again. Please to send me on accompt of the Royall African Company of England one baill of blue Welch plaines, and the canoe may be returned with the come &ca that remains here."
2161,3,523,William Melross,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,19/09/1692,Fort,RAC,"Being advised that the Cabbosheers of Agga did expect (besides liquors given) payment for repaireing the Royal Company Factory there, and being willing to be satisfyed what their demands would be (as well as for preventing future trouble might be occasioned by their unreasonablenesse after the resetling thereof), I made inquiry of the said Cabbosheers, whose pallavour was that Mr Cross and others his predicessors did alwayes pay for the repaires of the said factory, and that the books at Cabo Corso Castle would shew the same. I asked them how much, they replyed 7 pease, so after some arguments past I told them in short that they [= I] would allowe them no more then what they had received, and that if they were not satisfyed therewith the Factory must remaine unresettled, to which they said they would goe or send to you towards Christmas, and if you will alowe nothing they must be content, in the mean time by my desire it may be settled imediatly, promiseing that the persone you send shall in no wayes be troubled about it, but that they will refere themselves wholy to you, which if you pleas to credit may settle as soon as shall think convenient, it being now or near as much repaired as the neccesaries will alowe. This I thought good to advise you for the reasons before expressed."
2162,3,524,William Melross,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,10/10/1692,Fort,RAC,"I had yours of the 8th ditto by Mr Thomas Smith, to whom according to your order shall deliver up the Royall Companys Factory and goods here and take his receipt for the same. When done shall come up to Cabo Corso Castle to receive your further commands. By this canoe comes 18 chests corne upon accompt of the said Company."
2163,3,525,Thomas Smith,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,10/10/1692,Fort,RAC,"This day according to your commands I received from Mr William Mellross the charge of this Factory with the goods and merchandize thereunto belonging on accompt of the Royall African Company of England, as per receipt will appear. Inclosed is a true inventory of the goods. I returne you many thanks for placeing me in this Factory. No care nor pains shall be wanting in me to promote the Royall Company intereast in this place. Pray be pleased to send me down a baill of Welch plains of what couler you have by the first conveyance."
2164,3,526,Thomas Smith,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,15/10/1692,Fort,RAC,"This comes to informe you that the Cabbosheers of this place are very important [= importunate] for their dues (as they call them) at a new Cheifs settling, which I am not willing to give without your orders. They demand the value of goods which Mr Melross gave them. Likewise the Braffo &ca [demand] their dues, you may see by Melross accompt what they were, the same value in goods by me will satisfy them both. Pray send me word what quantity of corne you would have me buy, likewise the prizes of slaves. I could gett much more come had I the goods they want, which are fine sletias and plains. I desired a baill of plains in my last. If you have any fine sletias pray send one case with the plains and ane iron crow, pickax and a shod shovell and a corne shovell on accompt of the Royall African Company of England and would be very necessary here."
2165,3,527,Thomas Smith,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,20/10/1692,Fort,RAC,"If you have not sent the goods desired in my last before this comes to hand pray send a baill or cace of boysadoes with the rest on accompt of the Royall African Company of England, and order the canoe to bring away what corne she cane, for the floor of this corne roome is very bad to keep corne, altho I have matted all the bottom over. Mr Melross will informe you I can keep corne for some time with great care. I am not willing to loose any oppertunity of sending it to Cabo Corso where there is better conveniency then what I have. 30 deall boards if they can be spared will make this corne roome as good as any in Guiney of the bignesse."
2166,3,528,Thomas Smith,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,22/10/1692,Fort,RAC,"Yours I received by the 13 hand canoe with a baill of green Welch plains and a baill of boysados on accompt of the Royall African Company of England, and have returned per the same canoe 20 chests good corne on the Royall Company accompt."
2167,3,529,Thomas Smith,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,02/11/1692,Fort,RAC,"Inclosed is my October accompt. No trade stirring here, for I have not took one cra cra since Mr Melross left me, and but a little corne, I hope in a little it will be better. When I op[e]ned the boysadoes I found _ of them damaged, some more some lesse, likewise a great many of the Welch plains, pray order somebody to view them that the damaged may be valued and be ready for the traders again[st] they come. I am sorrie the corne I sent should not hold measure, when it was measured by the same chest my predicessors made use of, which I sent to Cabo Corso with the corne, and have of the same size by me, which was not found fault withall in his time, but I am afrayed there was some juggle played by the canoemen, one of them see it measured as they always doe. I hope for the future if any corne to be wanting youll make them make it good, and not me pay twice over. If you please to give the smith leave he will make a shovel, pickaxe and iron crow for the factory, which canot be without, likewise 200 naills to naill the matts round the bottom of the come room and up against the sides of the wall. I have bought 20 matts more then Mr Melross left me, designe to make it as secure as I can, considering I have no boards."
2168,3,530,Thomas Smith,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,04/11/1692,Fort,RAC,"The King of Soboe hath sent down to me for 4 barrells powder and about an ounce in lead barrs upon credite, for they intend to go against the Futures tomorrow night. If the bussiness takes good efect they hope to make you full satisfaction, if not they will pay for the powder and barrs. Pray send a possitive answer what I shall do in the bussinese for they tarry till the messenger returns, for they are very earnest and resolve upon the action of revaingeing Mr Gregory's death. Pray dispatch the messinger with what speed you can."
2169,3,531,Thomas Smith,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,09/11/1692,Fort,RAC,"Yours I received with ten half barrells powder on accompt of the Royall Company. Pray be pleased the next conveniency to send me about 30 blue pautkies and 30 paper brawles, in any old case, on ditto accompt. I have sent 20 chests good corne by the 13 hand canoe. They told me Mr Cooper did not give them canky money, nor would they [omission] without I paid them 13a. Arthur Conner came here last night. According to your orders Mr Farmer will goe to Agga."
2170,3,532,Thomas Smith,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,12/11/1692,Fort,RAC,"Pray send the 1st conveniency with the goods I wrotte for in my last, [and] 1 piece red cloth on accompt of the Royall African Company of England."
2171,3,533,Thomas Smith,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,18/11/1692,Fort,RAC,"Yours I received wherein you informe that the last corne I sent to Cabo Corso wanted one chest measure. I am verry well saisfyed they had such measure of me as would hold out with that at Cabo Corso, the chest being the same size as that which use to give content at Cabo Corso. Both the souldiers and canoemen see it all measured, if they play the rogue among themselves I canot help it. Any of them that have a mind to be a rogue may leave two or 3 basketts at any rogues house when they carry it down to the canoe from the Factory, for I take no further care of it affter I have delivered full measure to them. I hope you will not lett me suffer for there knavery. Pray send the goods wrotte for per the first conveniency."
2172,3,534,Thomas Smith,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,02/12/1692,Fort,RAC,"Herewith comes my November accompts. The ballance I retain here, which I hope is no predjce [= prejudice], being I am to pay the souldier and slaves in few dayes, very little money comeing here and not much corne. I owe about 60 chests corne upon tally at 2a per chest which I cannot give you ane accompt of till they have goods for them. The Blacks wants Benneen cloaths, as they say. I have sent for severall goods for them and when they come they buy non of them, which makes me unwilling to trouble you, but however if you please you may send 32 for a tryall per the next slave that comes from hence to Cabo Corso.
[PS] Inclosed is the certificat of the damaged gre[e]n plains & boysadoes 8."
2173,3,535,Thomas Smith,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,08/01/1693,Fort,RAC,"Herewith comes my December accompts with the ballance being 4a 10ta. If you do not send for the corne it will be spoyled, lett me take all the care I can. When the hoy comes pray order the measureing chests at Cabo Corso to come down in the hoy, with a case of sayes. Pray send now per the slaves 64 blue pautkies if he can bring them. The Cabbosheers of this place demand for their Christmass dashees on[e] sey, two green Welch plains and eight gallons brandy, they say they had as much in Mr Blooms & Mr Gregorys time. Pray send word what must be given them."

The blue pautkies are half of them damaged, pray order some person or other to view them that the damaged may be valued. I could not possible do other ways with the Braffo and Cabbosheers here then I have done about their Christmass dashees, have transgresed la beyond your orders, in both which I hope you will excuse me.

2175,3,537,Thomas Smith,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,29/07/1693,Fort,RAC,"This day [I] was showne per my boy and Arther Coner the Black man I bought my sheep and lambs off, and accordingly sent for Coffee that he might see him liveing in the town, in hopes I should have some redress. The slave Herentes that liveth at this factory brought that man to me that sold me the sheepe, and he denies that to be the man that Arther Corner and my boy testifies to be the same, he haveing given him some small matter to deny it, and Coffie instead of redressing me was going to knock the boy to the ground with a great stick for justifieing the truth, and [my] indevering to hinder him put him into a great passion against me. that he gave me several blows on the face, which I never expected nor deserved from his hands. He brought all the town about me, and for my satisffaction of demanding right of the man I bought the sheep off [I] was very much beaten and almost hald [= hauled] to peeces amongst them, not suffering me to enter into the factory, but still as I endeavered to goe that way was ma[u]led and beaten by them sufficiently, being all I can expect from them except some other course be taken with them, for Coffee countenances all rogues in whatever action they comit. This town is wholy a herber [= harbour] for them, Coffee being their head is the reason no trade comes to this factory, for they panyar all straingers and others that are not their gang, and brings false pallavers on them, which frightnes all people from coming near this place. They have played so many roguish actions with Saboe people that all goe to Annimaboe, fearing to come here. I have agreed with the people very well ever since I came here, till I came to press upon their franchies [= franchise] as being rogues, to have my selfe righted by some honest means, which they are alltogether straingers to, and will no way lose their privelidges to make satisfaction for my wrongs, cheats & abuses done by them, being upheld by Coffee their Captain.
[PS] This was wrott and sealed being before Hanssico came down here, intending to send it tomorrow from Anni[m]aboe, by reason I have no boy to carry it from hence. Coffee and my selfe should agree very well if it were not for rogues harbouring here. I desire leave till Wednesday or Thirsday next at furthest before I send this months accompts, by which time I hope to give you a full accompt of the corne I am to buy. I hope you will give more credite to me then you will to Hansaco, who is Coffees great friend and will tell you a faire story in his favour, maybe to my prejudice."
2176,3,538,Thomas Smith,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,03/08/1693,Fort,RAC,"By the bearer have sent you my last months accompts in which are the first of the corne you ordered me to purchase. If you want 40 or 50 chests come can procure them by Tewesday next, which [if] you have occasion for, pray dispatch the messinger with all convenient speed, that I may have the more time to comply with your desires."
2177,3,539,Thomas Smith,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,04/08/1693,Fort,RAC,"I makeing a small mistake in my accompts, which I found out as soon as the messinger was gone from me, I sent one after him to bring him againe, which I have now returned by this bearer. I was in hopes by this time to have received orders to propose my selfe for Whydah (haveing a little bussiness to settle at Cabo Corso Castle [&]ca). If I was there I believe I can do as much for the Companys interist as any you can propose to send. It is in your power to do what you please, I again humbly request to be sent there as Chief, hoping you will not place any one over my head, since I desire to goe for Whydah. To my knowledge I never deserved the ill will of any persons in the government, but have endevored to carry my selfe fairly and justly to all persons, whatever bac[k]biters may say of me to the contrary, which they cannot justifie to my face."
2178,3,540,Thomas Smith,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,07/08/1693,Fort,RAC,"Yours I received on the 4th & 5th instant, and had answered the former but my accompts &c were gone before it came to hand. I have sent by the bearer a sample of corne I have purchased on the Royall Companys accompt, taken this morning as it rises out of the come roomes. The person that informed you I took in noe come told you halfe his story, as I believe he did the same concerning the affront and injury done me by Coffee, which you take no more notice off then done to a dog, when I thought you would have branded him for taking part with unjust Negroes when they do injuries to the Royall Companys factors. You are to apt (as doth appear) to give creditt to an notorious lying Negroe, who is publicklie known to be such, then to a factor, which is the reason hath made you transffer Abington law to Cape Coast. I have carefully perused the coppy of the letter sent you on the 4th instant, wherein I find nothing worthy of reproofe. I thank God I am my selfe now and was not at that time as much in my senses as usually. I am very sensible who I write to and what I writt. There are no reflections in my last on any perticuler person, not one word tending towards heat or passion (however you may represent it), nothing but what is civill and modest and with submission and would have been so taken by any wise and discreet men, but what can I expect from persons prepossest with an ill opinion of me without any cause or reason?"
2179,3,541,Thomas Smith,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,04/09/1693,Fort,RAC,"By the bearer have sent my August accompts. I have not taken one cra cra since I came from Cabo Corso Castle. Captaine Curtis and Ingerham his trustee liked the corne I had by me on the Companys accompt so well that they both said better corne could no man desire, and if they had no wors[e] desired no better to take aboard ship."
2180,3,542,Thomas Smith,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,18/09/1693,Fort,RAC,"The wood you ordered me to be cutt is now ready. If you please when you send the canoe for it to send me on accompt of the Royall Affrycan Company of England four or six chests of sheetes with 10 cases speritts. I could sold most of the perpetuanoes at 10an per perpetuano, they will not give any more."
2181,3,543,Thomas Smith,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,19/09/1693,Fort,RAC,Yours I received and have according to your order sent you fifty sticks of wood for handspikes on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England.
2182,3,544,Thomas Smith,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,02/10/1693,Fort,RAC,"I have by the bearer sent my September accompts, & have delivered the 10 barrels of gunpowder sent here the 29th of the last month according to your orders to the person that brought your note for the same. If you have any blew Welsh plains (the next time you send a canoe down into these parts) pray send one bale on accompt of the Royall African Company of England. Here is no trade nor likely to be any as I see as yet, only for corne, which they are willing to part withall for goods & may be had for 1_ an per chest. If you think convenient can purchase what you please to order me."
2183,3,545,Thomas Smith,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,07/10/1693,Fort,RAC,"This morning the people of this town seized 15 peeses perpetuanoes going from Mr Edward Searle, Chiefe of Annimaboe, to Cabo Corso to be sold there on the said Mr Searles private and proper accompt, as I were informed by persons that were carrying of them to Cabo Corso. The perpetuanoes will be keept in the town untill they know your pleasures what shall be done with them, being pretty well assured that they do not belong to the Royall Company. Pray be pleased dispatch some orders about them."
2184,3,546,Thomas Smith,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,09/10/1693,Fort,RAC,"Yours I received of yesterdays date, & had sent an answer last night if I could have gott all the perpetuanoes into my costody, there being two still remaining in the hands of one Quacoone, a surly, doged, morosse, willfull fellow, he demanding 5 peezes in gold before he parts with them, saying that Ambo at Cabo Corso is so much indebted to him, he will keep them for satisfaction of that debt. Coffee underhand perswaids him to it, who is the author, continuer, promoter and upholder of all villanys &c that are acted in this town, thoug[h] he will not be openly seen in any thing, and yet [is] the head of all mischeif, perpetualy brooding and hatching the same, for I have made it part of my business of late to dive into his actions and his canting way of managing intreagues, who wipes his mouth and sayes he does nothing, who is a perfect [word illegible] of villiney. I had 11 perpetuanoes from Coffee, who makes demand of debts owing to him from persons liveing at Cabo Corso, and expects satisfaction before I part with the perpetuanoes, if not he expects the debts to be paid by me. He sayes Quo belonging to Hansicoe owes him a bendy, and one Odi belonging to Amoe 11an, and another 10an but cannot tell me his name. It plainly appears that these perpetuanoes were not seized to serve the Royall Company but their own private ends, which I hope will be converted to the Royall Company advantage thoug[h] not designed so when taken, being done illegally and contrary to the laws and customs of their own countrey to take white mens goods to pay black mens debts, where there is dayly people coming to and through this town from Cabo Corso, and if any such sums of money be owing they are to act accordingly to their own country laws by seizing such persons as come from thence or live at Cabo Corso, and not whit mans goods who owe them nothing, therefore I looke upon this as an intreague of Coffees to gett the best part of the two perpetuanoes for himselfe, and if suffered to goe on in their severall illegall wayes and practices without being branded there will be no liveing here for any person. Coffee being more insolent and open [in] his affaires then usually, and tell me to my face the Gentlemen at Cabo Corso do not love me in my souldiers hearing, upon which he presumes to act as he pleases, though I endeavour to carry all faire with him and shall not find fault without a cause. Coffee is not to be perswaided upon any termes to go up to Cabo Corso. If you have a mind to speake with him Hansicoe at Cabo Corso must be the man to perswaid him to go up or nobody. I send the aforementioned not[e] to lett you understand how affaires are managed here, & leave all to your judgement to act as you shall see cause & think convenient, no wayes doubting your kindness.
PS. Searles boy Hansico being now at Cabo Corso, can tell you the persons that were carrying the goods to Cabo Corso."

I have one slave that hath been of no use to mee this five weeks or more, and believe will hardly be fitt for any service this 2 or 3 months, being blinde of his ey[e]s. If you please to give mee leave to send him up to Cabo Corsoe and send mee downe another in his room, you will much oblige [me]."
2188,3,550,Thomas Smith,Anashan,,Cape Coast Castle,04/12/1693,Fort,RAC,"Per the bearer have sent my November accompts. The slave you sent demands 2 months pay, if due will pay him. If you can spare 3 or 4 pair of irons, pray send them per the bearer, with six or eight wedges for them. In all probability may have occasion for them in a little tyme and would not willingly bee unprovided. I have very good conveniency for 50 chests of corne more.

I could not buy the men, except I bought the woman, and rather than loose two such lusty young fellowes, did buy them all together, though the woman is noe of the youngest, being of a midle age, yet strong, lusty and healthful, and may endure hard labour better and longer then a young girle. I returne you thanks for your ready help in supplying mee with the Doctor. I am but indifferent as yett, hee finding mee almost at deaths door. I hope in two or three dayes more to bee in condition to part with him, and hope you will spare him soe long. If I can doe without his assistance in less tyme shall send him to Cabo Corso Castle. I hope you will give mee leave to charge canoe hire for bringing the slaves to Cabo Corso, I not being willing to part with such slaves out of my sight into any other hands.

If the slave had run away, then it had not laid att my door but theirs that sold him to me. This comes only to desire a bale or two of blanquetts on accompt of the Royall African Company of England, and to informe you the Factory is very much out of repaire, occasioned by the raines this year. I have spoke to Coffee to repaire it, but he sayes it is none of his buissiness to doe it, but the slaves, soe if it be, desire I may have two more men slaves to assist therein, the two I have not being able to goe through with it.

The sloope nor canoe brings no wood by reason its so verry short & small, so that four sticks will scarcely make one of the usuall bigness, & they insisting to have the same price as formerly, thought it best to lett it alone then take it."

Ralph Francklyn, who I imploy as Serjeant, came to tell me he was there, I ordered him to open the gates and let him in, but before he could get the gates open [he] was gon som small way from them, and then would not returne, and the same night sent to know the reason why I did not get the gates open against he came. I answered that he might have come when they were open, or stayed till they could be got open. For this the next morning early they panniard the Arda slaves, beat them and detained them from comeing into the Castle, and afterwards came the Cabbosheers by Bonnishees order, as also the Captain of the Bendifoes and Bonnishee's son Asam, they two makeing a palaver that the gates should be shutt and nothing come in or out of the Castle, and accordingly caused the same to be done. None of the Cabbosheers spoake in this palaver. Now you noe [= know] all, and whither you protect me or protect me not Il not live here, for had I gone out of the Castle, as sometimes I doe to walk, they had served me as they did Nightingall. I have done nothing as yet about the corne. Bonnishee, when I received your orders to give la 9ta per chest, being gon up country, I could get none of th[e] Cabbosheers into the Castle to make the palaver, unless I gave 2a per chest as he had ordered."

I thinke it better to let this dashee alone and send something to the Corrantiers to bring them downe, and make the Cabbosheers pay as well as Bonnishee, who I beleive [I] shall get from the towne. I shall keepe the gates shutt till such time I heare from the Corrantiers.

I have likewise altred my January accompt according to your order, which goes likewise inclosed. I have used all possible means to gett corne but can gett non. I understand that Capt.

Corne you will see by my accompts have but little, and most I have of that expended, which is the reason the canoe returns without corne. I have used my utmost indeavours to procure corne but can gett non, Domminy and others keeping a Factory ashore for interlopers, buys up all and getts what money comes to town, so that I am forced to take the Companys goods to pay Factory charges, and do dayly receive so many abusses and affronts her[e]s no liveing unlese some course or other be taken. I believe I could do it efectually if youl protect me."
2284,3,646,John Gregory,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,24/04/1692,Fort,RAC,"Haveing received so many unsufferable abusses from Bonnishee and several others belonging to this town, thought it fitt for the intrest and honour of the Company to seize upon him, which accordingly yesterday in the afternoon I did, with Humphrey, Finny, Eggen & Petter Quashi, they all supplying Captains Parish, Bill [= Bell?] & Chantrell with slaves, corne &ca, likewise threatning


 to s[e]ize all goods that is bought out of the Factory, oblidging all to buy of them, insomuch that since the interlopers came here I have not taken one taccoe of gold, Capt. Parish also keeping a white man in Bonnishees house with goods. We have done very well as yett, and don't doubt but to make them comply to our just demands. I have but one months provision in the Fort, but de[s]ires you would ease me of some of the women slaves with their childreen, being about 12 in number. I have burnt all the house[s] about the Fort & am well provided of all amunition, but powder have not above 2 barrells, desires you to supply me with some and hand granadoes.

You will see [from] lynes forgoeing that I have panniard Bonnishee &ca, which after I had I gave other Blacks warning to be gone from the Fort, which instead of goeing they turned their backsides to it, a thing we think not to be taken by any [that] has command of a Fort, especially knowing how sufficiently we have been abussed. There is no white man dares goe into the town, the sentinalls struck [and] abused in the Fort, hats stole of theire heads, threatning to put me in irons if they could gett me into the towne, in short the Fort and all that belonged to it was his [i.e. Bonishee's] and he would sell or do with it as he pleased. If you will stand by me I do not doubt but to make a honourable palavour with them."
2286,3,648,William Cross,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,12/05/1692,Fort,RAC,"This accompanies Mr John Gregory, from whom as you have been pleased to order have received into my possessione Charles Fort, Annimaboe. An inventory of all goods, merchandize, stores &ca remaining I have sent inclosed. The place is much altred since I was here last. Pray be pleased to make the pallavera with Bennishee and Fantine Cabbosheers, moste of our people being fearfull the Blacks will do them some mischief if they catch them opertunly out of the Castle, so I find we must be forcied to stand upon our own guard, admitte but few at a time and never trust them as formerly. In a day or two shall writte more at large according as I see occasione.
[PS] There are 3 men killed as some say, others say 5, the town great part of it burnt togither with the peoples goods, besides what has been lost otherwise, and
I think they will come upon us if this pallavera is not compounded upon sure grounds with the Fanteenes at Cape Corse."
2287,3,649,William Cross,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,13/05/1692,Fort,RAC,"Not long after Mr Gregorys departure came Bonnashee[s] brother Quashee and some few Cabbosheers with their usuall complyment, after which I told them I was come to make peace and recomposse all the differences, and for the future no man whatsoever under my command should wrong nor abuse them or any of the Blacks, if they did they must make their complaint to me for satisfaction, and that at present they must take no exception [that] I admitted niether their boyes nor arms as formerly, for it was not the custome at Cape Corse Castle and must be no more here, neverthelesse we would live in peace and amity, and trade should be free and open, upon which they begine to bring in some provisione, and I have ordered our people to take no more custome of fish, and we have it brought in at reasonable rates, and I hope all will come to a right understanding, but they must never be trust[e]d as before, and most of our people to are [blank] of being surprized by them out of the Castle. Corne room and yard is unthatched and will be washed down in a weeks time if the rain containow thus, especialy [the] without part built of [blank] only, I expect every hour to fall, which have sett the slaves to thatch it if that will preserve it. Pray be pleased to send the surveyer down, that I may advice with him about the repaires of the Fort, for their is much wanting within as well as without. I have occatione for three cases of fine sletias, 50 blankets, 6 quarter casks rum and six chests of sheets, which I desire you to send on accompt of the Royall African Company of England, togither with what lime you can."

This we thought fitt to acquaint you.
[PS] As for my part I will take no affront neither will I give any, but the first Black that asails any white man I will certainly kill him. F.S"
2289,3,651,William Cross,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,16/05/1692,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 14th instant I received and am glade to hear of the surveyours comeing, for we very much want him. I find their is no liveing for Mr Francis Smith and Doctor Dowglas, the Blacks will cut them in pieces if they gett them at an advantage, for a[s] soon as they come to the Castle and see them their quarrell seems to be revived. I desire therefor I desire you would be pleased to remove them, and have adviced that if anything should happen I may not be blamed for it. I cannot denie but they are both of them very fitt to serve the Royall Company, but will do much better in other places."
2290,3,652,William Cross,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,17/05/1692,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 16th instant with the inclosed I have received, for which I returne you most heartie thanks. I know their good will now, and wish they were as carefull of themselves as I am of them all and all others the Royall Affrican Company intrest and concernes. I need say no more but reffer you to what I wrote yesterday, which I hope you have been pleased to take into consideration. The inclosed is a pettitione of the soldiers, write and directed amongst themselves, which upon their request occasione my sending now, pray be pleased to remove them all and send others in their roome, and a man or 2 more if you please as soon as possible. The corne roome and wall are a great part washed down and ly open. For our security I have caused an iron chain to be fixed to the Castle gate (that being big and unwildey [= unwieldy] of itself) by which we can keep it open or shutt and non can enter butt under the chain, which we keep locked.
[PS] Pray be pleased to send me a strong padlock."
2291,3,653,William Cross,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,18/05/1692,Fort,RAC,"The rain comeing in as it does, every shower goes through the tarras, I am affrayed it will rot the raft[er]s if it be not prevented in time, so that I desire you would be pleased to send the surveyour with a workman or two with matterials as soon as you can conveniently spare them, and pray advise when [= whether] you would have the corne room built and thatched as before, if so I must gett the assistance of the Cabbosheer[s], for what slaves are here are not able to gett through with it. I want a window case with barrs and shutters for the warehouse, for the other is pulled down and broak to pieces and the window filled up with swish and bricks, which must be taken away again to give the goods aire. Here is little trade, nor can I expect any as long as these interlopers ly here, so that I shall send no accompt untill the end of this month."

By this canoe have received 3 cases fine sletias, 6 chests cheets and 6 quarter cask rum containing 150 gallons rum, all on accompt of the Royall African Company of England.
PS. Pray be pleased to send two more by the first conveyance, to make up the complyment as before."
2293,3,655,William Cross,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,27/05/1692,Fort,RAC,"These are to acquaint you that yesterday morning came all the Cabbosheers of the towne to demand their custome upon a new Chief settling. They had severall other pallavers, as is usuall at such times, of little or no consiquence, the most matteriall was in short this, they told me that 6 men were killed and dead of their wounds and 6 more lay so that they thought they would not recover, and that upon fireing the town severall people lost a great many goods besides what were burnt, and they would know of me how [= who] must pay for all this. I told them I was not here then and could say nothing to it, and thought their pallavour had been made up at Cabo Corsoe Castle, upon which their was a hott debate amongst them for some time till Bonashee stood up and paceifyed them, and after silence they told me what I said was true, and that we were all new men and had done them no harme, and should receive non from them or any of their people, and that they would trouble me no more about this pallavour, and departed very [blank], I desire you would be pleased to order their custome to be paid, the particullars of which Mr John Gregory left with me as he paid by his accompts, which I hope will confirme all better.
PS. The Cabboosheers desire you to accept of Bonashee for a pawne for [him], and he and they will see his debts paid in gold and corne in a short time, for if he lies at Cape Coast and nobodie to look after his busines he will not be able to pay you."
2294,3,656,William Cross,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,03/07/1692,Fort,RAC,"By the bearer I have sent my accompts and balance, mk4 6o 10a 4ta in good Fanteen gold. It is most for fine sletias and damniefyed goods, which I think is better to dispose on then to lett them ly and grow worse. Besides here is tallow, snaphancees, musquetts &ca which will never turne to accompt, and the tallow, being some without and some in broken casks, will be eaten quite up by the rates [= rats] if not removed, I desire you will be pleased to send for them up. We find more goods damnified then per last inventory, becaus the warehouse was dark, the windoes being filled, could not so well look over them as we have done since. 3 course sletias I have disposed at 4a each, which were mentioned good but there is never a good man amongst them all, and if you look over all the accompts of Annimaboe you will hardly find any disposed of since they were raised from 4 to 5 angles, which is above two years since. I had no peace nor quiteness with the Cabbosheers before I had paid them their custome at a new Chiefs settling, and I was unwilling to trouble you any further, hearing you were all indesposed, becaus it is no more than what others has paid and been allowed att their first settling."
2295,3,657,William Cross,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,03/07/1692,Fort,RAC,"I have by the bearer sent you 2 small bulces of Arcania gold, one containing mk3 & [the other] loz 14a. The former I am indebted to you 4 quarter cask rum, for the other 15 gallons brandie at my comeing down. I am very sorrie to hear of the losse of Mr Elwes, but Doctor Douglas letter other day was a great comfort when he advised of your recovery, I hope you will keep yourselves as you are. If Mr Bloome comes not up till you hear out of England, if not be pleased to look upon me as oldest factor, for I have been here this last time seven years if I live till October, next Chief of outFactory, and have latly given the Company 1000 pounds security, of which I had advice by Capt. Butteram, but I will trouble you no further."

If I had not seen it as I did it had certainly been down altogether, therefor pray send present help. There is fifteen foot from wall to wall. I have occasione likewise for 2 casks lime and 3 cases fine sletias, if any of [them] are damnified be pleased to value them before they come down & send by this conveniency, and by the returne of the canoe may be sent up these musquets &ca before mentioned. Here will be no corne fitt to take in this fortnight or 3 weeks, as soon as there is shall advise you. I hope these lines will find you in good health."

Bonnashee and the Cabbosheers are not yet come down from danceing, and those that have corne ay [sic: = ?] here dare not lett me have any, for fear of being apprehended by them before they have pallaverd about the disposall of it, so I can gett non to send by this canoe, but hope by the next conveniency to have some ready."
2298,3,660,William Cross,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,18/07/1692,Fort,RAC,"By the returne of the 11 hand canoe have sent you 20 chests corne for accompt of the Royall African Company of England at 2a per chest, which is as cheap as it can be purchased at present, much of the corne being spoyled by the great rains fell this year."
2299,3,661,William Cross,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,23/07/1692,Fort,RAC,"These accompany the Surveyour, who hath left the carpenter and bricklayers to finish what is further to be done about the Forts repaire. Yesterday arrived in this road in a sloop from Barbadoes bellonging to Jamica, on[e] Benjamin Rawlings, who gives advise of Capt. Sherlys and Capt. Edwards safe arrivall and that Mr Humphras left the former at Barbados. Mr Upton some time since wrote to me to procure 20 goats or sheep for use of the table, telling me the great want you were in, and [myself] haveing such a stock of the former by me, he may use this oppertunity of my hammock (if you think convenient) to come and see them.

I humbly desire you excuse my not writting, being very much troubled with the gripes, by reasone of cold which I have taken lying out of my roome."
2301,3,663,William Cross,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,29/07/1692,Fort,RAC,"This comes with the bad news of Mr Crosses death, who departed this life bettween 1 and 2 a clock this afternoon, haveing made no will nor other settlement of his concerns, which are at present in my custodie, I therefor humbly desire you will please with all expedition signify your pleasure in this disastrous affair, which shall punctually be observed."

I have also sent his ring and a bulce of money containing 10ta, which I had from the serjeant, which he sayes and I verryly believe was all he took out of the deceaseds pocketts, which he keeped in hopes you would please as customary to allow him for striping the departed. He has as he reports nothing more then a shirt, old westcote [= waistcoat], pair of stockings, shoees, silver buckles and britches [= breeches], which if you please you may send [for] per the next conveniency. Mr Searle if you please will buy his _ box of candles, remaining suggar and rum. Some things I thought were his 1 am told belong to the Company, haveing remained in this Factory a considerable time, so that I know of nothing more then a pair of stillyards and old broken case and candlestick. At the time of his decease and long before, [I] was very ill myself of a violent feavear and ague and loosnesse, insomuch that I could not overlook his concerns with the care I should otherwise have done, but to my knowledge he hath not been defrauded of anything, notwithstanding the malitious censures of peace breaking and ill minded men, but in all things [I] have acted no worse then, should it please God to bring me to the like estate, I desire to be used."
2305,3,667,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,13/08/1692,Fort,RAC,"Bonishee and the rest of the Cabbosheers of this place have been at me for their customes at the settleing of a Chief, which I thought needfull to advise you off before I pay any. Our corne roome is likewise in very bad condition, and without the help of the free people will not be fitting to receive corne this year. Here is severall blacks demands amongst them all payment for 8 chests corne at 2a per chest and one goat at 4a, which they tell me is due to them by Mr Cross. When I receive your answer shall ob[s]erve your orders."
2306,3,668,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,23/08/1692,Fort,RAC,"According to your orders have gott above 30 chests corne, which I desire you would be pleased to send for, here being no place to [p]reserve it as yett, but I hope in little time to have the corne roome thatched, and I desire a bricklayer with matterials to floor it. Corne is very hard to be gott and not anything under 2a per chest. We have no great canoe here, that which Mr Cross left not being serviceable, so I hope you will be pleased to order one."

As for corne, non can be bought under 2a per chest, and I believe no great quantity att that rate. Also yours of yesterdays date have received by the 13 hand canoe, which overturned just before the landing place, all the bricks you sent were lost, most of the lyme casks was staved and the lyme lost. The bricklayer tells me he will want 1000 bricks. The canoe is staved so as that she cannot returne without mending. The bearer hereof is one of the canoe men, which comes to you for iron work for her. At her returne shall send what corne she can convenientyly carry.
PS. In my last I desired a canoe for use of the place, which we much want. Had we had one might have given the great canoe assistance yesterday."
2308,3,670,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,27/08/1692,Fort,RAC,"Yours by the 5 hand canoe came to hand yesterday. They have mended the canoe and I put on board 20 chests corne, which is what she could conveniently carry. I humbly desire you would be pleased to send me 2 men slaves more, here being but one slave fitting for service, whatever want we have of them. I hope you will send me some more bricks and lyme."
2309,3,671,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,30/08/1692,Fort,RAC,"This is only to desire some more bricks and lyme, for want of which we cannot finish the corne roome. We have wrotte [= wrought] all the pieces we have about the Fort, and are in want of above 600 bricks more, if you send pieces they will serve. Also desire a pair of strong hinges with the hookes for the corne roome door and 2 pairs small for the windoes, and a carpenter for two or 3 days, a black will serve, being only for the fitting of doors and windoes.
PS. The boy that Mr Gregory had down that cleansed the armes went from hence last night, I supose for Cabo Corso. I have desired Mr Upton to send him back, but being a slave I thought fitt to acquaint you with it."

Bastian is here, has brought with him only a two foot rule. In the canoe goes a slave, by whom I desire to have the hoocks and hinges, a few naills and some carpenters toolls. According to your order have put on board the canoe 10 chests corne, which is what I had by me before your orders, at la 6ta."

I shall use my utmost indeavour to procure the quantity of corne you ordered me to buy, and likewise slaves if any presents, for the purchaseing of which I desire two or 3 cases of sayes, [and] if noe blue plains one baill of green. Here is a parcell of course sletias which I believe are the pickings of many cases and are much damnified, were they rated if good at 4a I believe I might dispose of some of the damnified accordingly, otherwise will lye and rotte here."

2316,3,678,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,19/10/1692,Fort,RAC,"According to your orders have valued the green plains and inclosed is a certyficat of the same, likewise another of a chest of sheets. Here is John Ladd and Thomas Tunbrige, two very refractory fellows not fitting to be at an outfactory, especialy where we must be so cautious of the natives as here we must be. When I was last at Cabo Corso they were very troublesome and would owe [= own] no supperior. I humbly desire that if the canoe that bring the goods be not gone that I may have two civell men in their places and per returne shall send them up. I desire John Ladd may not goe unpunished, for last Saturday he drew his sword on a fellow here, and uttred such words that is not fitting to be put in paper. I put him in prisone, where he shall containow, and he swears nothing shall serve him but my blood for revainge."
2317,3,679,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,20/10/1692,Fort,RAC,"When I came here I was unacquainted with what belonged to the Fort, but what we could informe ourselves of we put into the inventory. What I find more then what was put into the inventory is one iron gunn not serviceable, a drum, 4 pair irons, one maule, part of a cask tarr, one hand vice. For the green perpetuanoes it was a mistake in the coppying the inventory, for I find in mine 82, and likewise for the great shott and musquett shott I told Mr Platt was made away whith by John Pimm in Mr Cross's time. The serjeant tells me the firelock musquetts were sent to Cabo Corso in Serjeant Willsons time, and I suppose the sword. The old canoe before I saw this place was a good part used and cut in pieces. The iron barrs for the windoes or anything elce that is wanting, I can no way informe myself of them, if I find any I shall take as much care of them as if they were in the inventory. What I have found I have added thereto, what I find wanting is at the foot hereof.
[PS] I humbly desire you will please to remove these two fellows I wrotte you of yesterday by Mr Cooper.

Our flagg is all in pieces and not fitting to be wore any more, [if] you please to send me [a] long cloth I have remaining _ red perpetuano which will just make a flag.

2324,3,686,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,13/01/1693,Fort,RAC,"Yours I received of the 10th instant, and shall observe your orders for buying no more corne. I shall use all the means that can be for preserveing what I have already taken in. I take not a damboy of money, which is the reasone I made no accompts, but at the end of this month shall make up all in one. I desire you would be pleased to send me some powder on accompt of the Royall African Company of England. The battlements over our hall, on a gui[r]der which has formerly been supported, is broak and sunck considerably within these few dayes, so that if we have any rains it will damnifie the timbers very much. I desire you will be pleased to order some persones to veiw it if the guirder be of strength to bear the weight thereof, otherwise shall desire a new one before the rains."
2325,3,687,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,19/01/1693,Fort,RAC,"Yours by the Alligator sloope came to hand last night, & on sight thereof sent a messenger to Amersa & this morning had the felow here that had the shells, I sent him on board the sloope to veiw the butt & he is aggreed to fill it for 9a, we paying canoe hier. We are to pay for noe more than is received aboard, what is overturned goeing off they stand to the loss thereof, so that if you approve thereof you may send the canoe when you please, the sooner the better. The sloope lies at Annishan & we cannot take the goods sent us without the canoe but in two hand canoes, which may wett & spoile [ms. 'spiole'] the powder. I b[e]leive it will be best to make use of Amersa canoemen, being a bad landing place. In yours you accuse for contemning with your orders, for which you have butt little reason. My not sending accompts was not for self ends or anything like. Itt was the 2d instant when returned from you a[t] Christmas, & have been troubled with people ever since for Christmas dashees, soe thought that, takeing noe mony, att the end of the month might doe as well. A Mondy morning shall send my November & December accompts with coppies of my last.

According to your orders have sent the canoemen by land and have sent my Serjeant down to Amersa to see the shells sent on board. I have promised him an allowance for his expencesse the time he stays, so be pleased to advise what you will be willing to allow him.

Ever since he left this place I have been forceid to make use of one Agga slave which Mr Cooper could verry ill spare, by reasone he is about his corne roome. I desire youl please to send me another with this bearer, and if you have have any broad listed red cloath I desire one piece. I desire 3 or 4 small hingees for windoees, with 7 or 8 small staples and barr hookes for setting them open. The strong sea breas has broken almost all the windoees we have, I desire I may have [them] as soon as can be made, for want of which many of our windoes are forceid to be unhinged. The bricklayer haveing finished his work went from hence last Saturday.

The liquors and paper brawls and other things which they demand amounts to about one ounce. The men are willing to serve the Royall Company, and [pay] what is paid the natives for them, so when I have your orders shall observe them, and if you think convenient shall send down for the other two. They came from the interlopers, two from Capt. Hogben and two from the Barbadian. I desire I may detain one of them here and send up one of the fellows I formerly advised you of was so troublesome."
2329,3,691,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,04/02/1693,Fort,RAC,Yours of this instant have received. I have herewith send the two white men that are here and have sent a messinger to Winebah about the others. As soon as they arrive here I shall send them to you.

The men are very willing to pay what is disbursed for them out of their pays, of which all 4 must bear equaly. If the messinger be returned imediatly I may have them here tomorrow."

2332,3,694,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,01/08/1693,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys my July accompts. Corne I have not taken in as yet above two hundred chests. Next weeke I doubt not but to have the full quantity you ordered me to purchase. I desire two bailes more of plaines and some sheetes to be sent next opportunity. The knives that are remaining here are so very bad that I was forst to give the Cabbosheers 24 dozen for cuting their small corne, and that would hardly content them. The slave run away is certainly gone to Accra or Quamboo, his brother has the comand of Daines fort as the Blacks inform me, so that if you advise Mr Bloome of him he may gett him or satisfaction for his freedome.
[PS] I desire if you are supplyed with paper to send me a little per bearer I have not two sheetes in the fort, nor any of my neighbours so well stoct as to spare me any."
2333,3,695,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,18/08/1693,Fort,RAC,"Yours of this date I have received. The corne ordered Mr Cooper and myselfe to purchase was all taken in last week.

James Funnell Comander, five hundred twenty and one chest of good corne, and have advised Mr Bloome what both shipps hath taken, that he may furnish them with the remainder part of their complement and take receipts for all. The Katherine has four hundred & three from Mr Cooper and one from Mr Smith.
PS. Herewith goes a man which was put on shore per Capt. Curtis, which he told me was by your orders if his Doctor did not approve carrying him."
2335,3,697,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,15/09/1693,Fort,RAC,"This accompanyes my August accompts. The slave which [I] advised you ran away is at Quamboe. I have not discharged myselfe of him in my accompts, but I humbly desire you will be pleased to send me another along with the bearer. I desire on [ms. 'an'] accompt of the Royall Affrycan Company of England ten whole barrels of powder, some blue plaines and some sheetes. I have purchased according to your order one hundred chests of corne at loz 6ta per chest.

I humbly desire a few nailes as soon as possibly, the spouts of our tank are very much out of order and many other things here, and not a nail in the Fort.
[PS] Humphry & all others that is indebted to Mr Gregory shall not want pressing to pay me, I believe Humphry may pay his all this season, he gives faire promises."
2337,3,699,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,25/09/1693,Fort,RAC,"This serves only to advise you that this morning I had a messenger from the Braffo to desire me that I would give you advise that the Anguinas and Quamboes has agreed to assist you in building a fort at Wynebah but neve[r] intends it shall be finished, for the Quamboers are preparing themselves to paniard all the white men and the Royall Companies concernes. Whether he sends this message for selfe ends, that there may not be [a] fort there to hinder his customes here, or whether he be reall, I know not, but rather beleive it selfe ends then otherwayes, however thought it my duty since I had fresh advise to acquaint you with it."
2338,3,700,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,02/10/1693,Fort,RAC,"The Swallow, Capt. Richard Bradshaw, is arrived at Amersa & has sent to me to supply him with oystershells, so this is to desire canoes to carry them off. If you send two canoes they will sooner lade him. The canoe must call here to take the butt, and the men shall returne by land, & the Amersa canoemen carry off the shells. Capt. Bradshaw desires to know whether he is to send a man ashore, or to have a man from here to take accompt of the shells, his boatswaine being very ill, for when I have your orders shall gett him loaded with all the speed I can. Here is not a taccoe of gold to be taken, so shall referr my accompt to the end of this month."
2339,3,701,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,05/10/1693,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date I have received. The 5 hand canoe have sent to Amersa, & have sent Thomas Farr from hence to see that they dispatch Capt. Bradshaw as soon as possibly. In yours you order me to tell Thomas Tunbridge go to Anishan to worke for Mr Smith. I desire you not to think I am so ill a neighbour to deny him or any man else so small a kindness, was he not so abusive as you are sensible he is. This same Tunbridge has worked for him at his own house severall dayes together, and [he] was never denyed his worke or any thing I had in the fort, till he had so often abused me to my face in this fort & severall other places. None of our people can go thether but he is degrading me to them, which I think is beneath a factor so to uter his mind to a soldier. He hath often said he will do his utmost to ruine me, if he leave himselfe not worth a groat, which has made me deny myself and all that is under me going to his factory, but all those abuses shall not move me to disobey your orders, although I should be very glad that you would excuse me in this. I should never have troubled you with the difference between us did I not think by yours that he has wrote already against me.
[PS] Since the writing of this I understand he has wrote to my second & the said souldier to come to him without my leave, & that I am ordered not to hinder them. If it be so I cannot perceive I have any comand of my men."
2340,3,702,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,08/10/1693,Fort,RAC,"This serves to advise you that yesterday sending by Annisham 13 perpetuanoes which I trusted Captain Amo of Cabo Corso to sell for me, here being not any trade to defray the charges of the factory, there was 2 stoped by the Annisham people, the other are in the factory as I understand this morning. They was taken from my own slaves who I sent to carry them, so referr my selfe for you to order how I shall gett satisfaction for the affront given to the Royall Company by those rogues. If lett run on shall have nothing pass for them. I suppose if you order Mr Smith he can gett the other two, 11 he has in his possession.
PS. Since I wrote this my boy told me that in the morning when I sent him to Annishan & about it, that Mr Smith told him he thought they were interloper goods & that he had advised you purposely to play the rogue with me, which as he is mistaken, I hope you will take it as a roguish trick, and if that they had been another mans, he would not have medled with them, so I hope you will require them all of his hands.
[PPS] The Kinge of Saboe is now in this fort."
2341,3,703,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,09/10/1693,Fort,RAC,"Being senceable of the envy & mallice that my neighbour Smith bares me and not knowing how maliciously hee may have writt against me, I humbly desire you to grant mee leave to come up to Cabo Corso, and I doubt not but to cleare myselfe of all his asspertions."
2342,3,704,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,03/11/1693,Fort,RAC,"According to yours of the 13th October I have received from Mr Thomas Smith the 13 perpetuanoes which was seized by the people of Annishan. The Welch plaines sent the 21st September was very much damnified, as you will finde by the inclosed certificate. The Brigantine, Capt. Bradshaw, has on board eighty butts of shells. The two canoes are here, they may serve to load her once more, which I beleive will bee all, for they are old and not worth sending up to your parts. This accompanyes my accompts for September and October. Here is noe manner of trade nor like to bee any, not soe much as to defray factory charges. The corne ordered mee to purchase I have taken in the best part of itt."
2343,3,705,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,08/11/1693,Fort,RAC,"I am forced to trouble you with this through the impudence of Humphry Lowe which [you] sent hither Serjeant. Hee has been noe wayes forbearable to mee since he has been here, nor is hee fitting for the place hee is in, but I have endeavoured to beare with him as much as is possible. Yesterday hee came to mee and told mee hee was inform'd that I had said I would send him to Cabo Corso, and if I dared doe it, hee would have mee doe it then, and that it was more then I had power to doe, hee being placed by you, and that if I would send him up hee would desire noe better sport, for hee is sure you will not give him armes, but preferr him, and that hee would doe my busines, and a great deale more of such impertinent language. I put him in prison till this morning, and hee still continueing in the same minde, with unsufferable dareing language, I have by a two hand canoe sent him up, and humbly desire you will bee pleased to send me a man which may bee fitting for such a place as this is, you being sencible that the Natives are very unruly in these parts, and requires a carefull Serjeant. Had hee not been soe very impertinent, which is an ill example to the souldiers, I should not have sent him up till had your orders. I have paid him his pay to the tenth of this month."
2344,3,706,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,22/11/1693,Fort,RAC,"This comes by Boneshees boy, who is sent by him and the Cabesheirs of this place, and is to desire to bee trusted two barrells of powder and six lead barrs to carry on their warr against Cabess Terra, being resolved to fight this month, which if the warr was once ended I doubt not but wee should have had a brisk trade. When they goe from hence I have promised them two leade barrs and some powder as a dashee from myself, and offered them soe fair, that if they would give mee a good gold pawne, I would trust them with what powder they want to carry on their warr. They told mee they had noe pawne to give mee, but very desirous I should acquaint you with it. If I could have pacified them I should not have troubled you with this, soe as you are pleased to order I shall answer them according."
2345,3,707,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,29/11/1693,Fort,RAC,"According to yours of yesterdays date by this canoe I have sent by [sic] Mr John Pinck. Some tyme since I desired a carpenter to make door cases for the doors and other worke which wee are in great want of, and if not soon mended the Fort will want as much tymber as would halfe build of a new. Our prison is so out of repair that wee cannott safely keepe a slave in itt. If you please to send tymber fitt for such uses, with some bricks and lyme, and such tools as are at the foot




hereof, I can gett such things done here by a Black fellow, which with directions will doe well enough. And likewise I can have all iron work that is wanting made here if you please to order it, for want of which all things runs to ruine here. Sirs, this morneing the Cabbosheers were here to ask mee what I would give them to goe fight. I told them I would give them two lead barrs and eight cartridges powder. They demanded a barrell and four leade barrs, and because I did not comply with such unreasonable rogues, they went out in a huffe, as they always doe if they are contradicted in their demands. I desire to bee advised if there bee anything allowed them or not, soe that I may give them an answer at once. I think it is unreasonable they should bee complyed with in such demands, except these factoryes made better returnes then for these severall years they have done. I desire once more to have Thomas Tunbridge removed, who is very troublesome and not fitting for a place where there is but six men. I shall not enlarge, but if you please to enquire of Mr Pinck he can satisfye you about him.
PS. I have received the rumm. Send per Brigantine tools: 2 hammers, 2 hand sawes, 3 chisells, 1 hatchit, 1 adds [= adze], 3 a[ug]ers of severall sizes, 6 gimletts, 3 plaines."
2346,3,708,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,02/12/1693,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date I have received, and see you doe not allow of any powder or leade barrs to the Cabbosheers. They say they had it the last warr. If anything was allowed to bee given them, I desire there may bee the same allowance now, or here will bee no liveing. I desire on accompt of the Royall African Company of England, twenty barrels gunpowder, ten whole barrills and twenty halves, also one hundred perpetuanoes blue & some sheets. I desire I may have it a Munday, for wee are very bare of powder, I have only a barrell in the Fort that is good."
2347,3,709,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,05/12/1693,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date by the 11 hand canoe I received, with thirteen barrells powder and one hundred perpetuanoes blew, and Robert Jackson to remaine in the room of Thomas Tunbridge, who goes by this said canoe. Also I have sent you on accompt of the Royall African Company of England five good men slaves. I desire by the returne of this bearer twelve pairs of Negroe irons and two dozen rivetts. I have been ill this 3 or 4 [days], or should have sent my accompts before this tyme."
2348,3,710,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,09/12/1693,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 6th instant have received. You advice mee that one of the slaves sent you is bursten [= bursting]. I thought soe myselfe at first, but the Negroes told me it was a worme. However, if hee bee not passible, if you returne him I must take him againe. This accompts [are] for November. I hope in a short time this warr between the Cabess Terra and the Arcanyes will bee at an end, and then I doubt not but wee shall have a good trade."
2349,3,711,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,11/12/1693,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 9th instant with my accompts I have received, which you returne by reason of corne charged for the use of the slaves. Three of them I have kept above six weeks and the other two a full month, and I never knew but corne was allowed for them. If I have charged more then you think they may have eaten, I will give the Royall Company credit for as much as you please to order in my next accompts. As for sending slaves by land, is more than ever was or can safely bee done. Mr Smith sends them, because hee hath noe place to keepe them, soe that hee is forsed to doe it, or run the risk of losing them, but here useth to bee irons and all things allowed for their use, till opportunity of a canoe present, and I desire it may bee still the same, and when any canoes comes to these parts, if I have any slaves shall send 'em up. I hope after this warr, if the Arcannes have good success, that more slaves may offer then will bee convenient to send by land."
2350,3,712,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,14/12/1693,Fort,RAC,"This is to desire on accompt of the Royall African Company of England ten chests of sheets, if you have them. For want of sheets I have lost the buying of severall slaves, which are carried to the Dutch, who have enough to supply them by severall passages as has been here. I am sure that the Dutch are endeavouring to draw the Fetuers and the Cabess people under their protection, to bring the Arcanys and Fanteeners to make up the pallavera to their owne advantage, and if they cannot bring them to comply they will protect the former till they have the Quifferas and Dankeras to their assistance. This
I thought not amiss to informe you of, I being certain it is true. As yet the Arcanies have had good success."
2351,3,713,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,16/12/1693,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdayes date have received. When I hear farther of the Generall of the Mynees [= Mines] proceedings shall advise you. With this goes a Dutchman that came from Amersa, left out of an interloper, who is desirous to serve the Royall African Company."
2352,3,714,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,26/12/1693,Fort,RAC,"The Brigantine is at Amersa, and I have sent the canoe to load her. This is to desire nailes and staples to mend the canoes, or they will never halfe load her."
2353,3,715,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,29/12/1693,Fort,RAC,"Just now I have advice from Capt. Bradshaw that one of the canoes is staved and the other much out of repair, soe desires another canoe, and a considerable quantity of staples, with two or three hundred odd of great nailes."
2354,3,716,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,01/01/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of this date I have just received and per the bearer I have sent five yards violett coulored cloth, which is all I have left. I desire on accompt of the Royall African Company of England two pieces of broad listed red cloth to bee sent mee tomorrow, for the Cabbosheers have beene with mee for there Christmas dashees. My slaves are sick and lame, or should have sent them for itt. I desire a good man slave in the roome of him that runn away, for those that are here are not able to doe the worke of the Fort."
2355,3,717,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,03/01/1694,Fort,RAC,"This is to desire the red cloth desired in my last, for I shall never bee at rest for the Cabbosheers till they have their dashees, and also a man slave in the room of him that ran away. The bearer is all the men slaves I have that is able to doe any work."
2356,3,718,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,06/02/1694,Fort,RAC,"This accompanyes my accompts for December & January. Here is noe trade as yett. The natives gives great promises that wee shall have a free trade from the Arcanyes in a little tyme, but I much doubt the warr will bee another yeares dispute. The bricklayer you sent downe continued can doe noe more worke without the timber that is wanting, with lime and bricks considerable, which I suppose the surveyor satisfyed you at his returne from hence. Here is not a drop of raine but it comes downe into all our roomes. The spout of the tanck is soe that wee catch noe water, and a great many other things which wants to bee repaired aboute the fort, which if not done before the raines a great part of it will fall. When the canoes brings downe bricks &ca I desire the canoe men may bee looked after to load the canoe, for a 11 hand canoe brought downe noe more then five quarter cask lyme and aboute two hundred of bricks, which would have brought twice the quantitie. The first instant I received two women slaves from Mr William Cooper."
2357,3,719,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,13/02/1694,Fort,RAC,"This is onely to desire a man slave in the roome of him that is run to Quamboe. The slaves wee have here are not sufficient to finde the Fort in wood and water, they are soe disabled with wormes &ca and those which are well tell the Serjeant to his face they will run away, their work is soe hard, soe I humbly desire you will be pleased to spare me one more."
2358,3,720,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,21/02/1694,Fort,RAC,"According to yours of the 17th instant I have together with Mr Benjamin Layton inventoryd the Royall Companys concernes and sealed up all the warehouses in the Factory of Annishan, which inventorys will bee delivered you by Mr Layton, and likewise the keys of the warehouses. The tyme the bricklayer have been here, I have made our slaves, with other help, break stones, and have built a spur before our inner gate, which will be a very great safety to us against the natives, and wee are onely in want of a gate to finish it. I desire you will bee pleased to send downe by this canoe the gate case, and in two dayes it will bee finished. I desire it may be seaven foot high and four foot and a halfe wide."
2359,3,721,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,03/03/1694,Fort,RAC,"This accompanyes my February accompts. Trade is worse here now than ever, and I see but small hopes of better. If the surveyor be come from windward I desire he may be sent downe, with a carpenter and another bricklayer, for the bricklayer that is here I am afried will lose the use of his hands, and if not I am certaine he cannot by himselfe repare the Fort before the raines."
2360,3,722,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,09/03/1694,Fort,RAC,"According to yours of yesterdays date by this canoe goes Humphry Low, and I desire by returne of the same a man that is fitting to officiate in his place.
PS. Humphry Low has received his pay to the 2d instant."
2361,3,723,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,07/04/1694,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys my March accompts, and is to desire on accompt of the Royall African Company of England twelve chests of sheets, three bailes of blue Welch plains & a case of blue pautkies. If there be any sletias, either fine or course, come in these ships, I desire as many as can be spared, and three good padd locks for the use of the Fort, I have not a lock to either of our gates. I alsoe desire 12 good firelock musketts for the use of the Fort, not having two good of what is here, and when I receive them I will send up those which are here, that they may be mended."
2362,3,724,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,12/04/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdayes date per the 11 hand canoe I have received, with what goods you sent by her and twelve musketts for the use of the fort, and per returne of the same you will receive five men and four women slaves, also eighteen old fire lock musketts, I desire six of them may be returned when mended."
2363,3,725,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,26/04/1694,Fort,RAC,"According to yours of yesterdays date, inclosed is the bill of lading therein mentioned. I have delivered on Mr Gregorys accompt forty eight chests of corne, which is what I have received on accompt of his debt.
PS. Capt. Phillips gives you his service."
2364,3,726,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,07/05/1694,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys my April accompt. According to your orders I have shipped on both shipps three hundred fifty & four chests of corne, vizt two hundred eighty six chests on accompt of the Royall Company, on Mr Gregory's accompt forty eight chests, and on Mr Smiths twenty chests to make good his accompts, the corne att Annishan being noe more than eighty chests, soe I desire I may be paid for the twenty chests out of his estate.
I understand by severall that you are assured of haveing the Danes Fort at Accra, doe humbly begg that you will please to favour me with it, where I doubt not but that I shall give all the satisfaction as may be required and shall endeavour to promote the Royall Companys interest to the utmost of my power, humbly begging you will please to grant my request, for which shall be ever thankfull."
2365,3,727,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,18/05/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of this date per the 11 hand canoe have received, with the particulars therein mentioned. When the Briganteen arrives att Amersa shall send downe the canoes to carry of the shells. The bricks is sufficient for present use, but wee shall want three casks more of lyme, for I shall be forced to make the bricklayer take up the battlements in severall places to stop out the water till you can send carpenters to repaire them, which is much wanted. I desire alsoe with the lyme a small cask tarris. In the inclosed note is the dementions of the door cases, windowes for the prison, and carriage[s] for the guns. The spur is finished, only wants the gate case & gate. Per this canoe have sent Nathan Lathom, and I humbly desire a civill fellow in his roome by the returne of this two hand canoe, alsoe a pair of halliards for the flag, & canvass for to make the heade, and a scaine of twine if any."
2366,3,728,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,21/05/1694,Fort,RAC,"According to your orders of the 14th instant I have made an inquiry after corne, which I finde as the Blacks pretend very scarse, saying the Mine people hasbought all they have, but here is great quantities carryed off by them dayly this severall dayes. I have endeavoured to make a palavera with the Cabbosheers att la_ per chest, but cannot prevaile for that price. This morning they told me if I would give 2a per chest I should have the quantity that I desired, under they would sell none, saying the Mine people paid more in ready money. The lime I received shall not be wasted, but spent where necessity forces, which is really almost over all the fort. I desire per first opportunity of faire weather the lime & tarras desired in my last, that I may have what leakes stopt I can, for the timber daily receives damage by the raines. I have received the particulars mentioned in your last of the 18th instant."
2367,3,729,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,28/05/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 26th instant I have received. The advice I gave Mr Bloome was according as you ordered. Here each shipp had one hundred seventy & seven chests, att Agga fifty chests each, and att Annishan forty each. I advised Mr Bloome that the Hanniball had five hundered fifty eight chests and the East India Merchant four hundered ninety two chests, and at the foot of his letter an accompt particularly what they had att each place. I humbly desire the lime & tarress, for our battlements are soe leaky that we are forced to sett quarter casks to catch the water. Alsoe I desire twenty cases spirits on accompt of the Royall African Company of England. The forty plaines received in Aprill, one bale was good the other seven of them damaged as per the inclosed certificate. As for corne here is plenty enough, the Mine people carryes of as much in a month at our landing place as we have occasion for, soe that we pay customes to a parcell of rogues for nothing. I humbly desire you will please to send me my sallary to the 24th instant."
2368,3,730,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,31/05/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdayes date by the 11 hand canoe with twenty cases spirits and the lime & tarress I have received. The Fort shall be repaired as much as can be without timber as soon as we have fair weather. If the raines continues much longer a great part of it will fall. I desire as soone as possible a gate for our spurr as it may be finished. Here is a parcell of loose beads, I desire to be advised how many pounds I may sell for one angle, the Blacks haveing vi[e]wed them severall times and sayes if they can have them reasonable they will buy the best part of them. By this canoe I have sent one man & woman slaves which I received from Mr Cooper on accompt of the Royall African Company."
2369,3,731,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,18/06/1694,Fort,RAC,"I am verry sorry for the losse of Royall Companyes concerns at Succondee. I shall be very carefull who I trust into the Fort, for I have been ever mistrustfull of these blacks since I have been here, and I beleave none more ready to doe anything that may tend to their [= the Royal Company's] disadvantage then them, had they but any opportunity. The Dutch has there Fort soe well maned that they never fear. Cormantine, a place that is but little bigger than this, has never less than twenty odd men. I hope, considering that the loss of these three Factories depends on this, and that blacks begin now to surprise Forts, you will be pleased to order me four men more, which may keep the blacks under and cause them to lay such thoughts aside, which otherwise they may attempt to make use of, knowing how weakly we are manned. I hope I shall suddenly have a good gate for our spurr as it may be finished, which will be of great strength to us. Our guns are mightily out of order. Wee are in great want of the carriages, and likewise of the door & window cases formerly desired. I desire a few spunge nailes, c[r]owes for stone, baggs and old junck for the gunners use, alsoe nailes for the use of the Fort, for I have not a naile whatever occasion we have for them. I desire a few granadoes that are well fixed, and fire lock musquets in the roome of them I sent up, three of the twelve I received are good for nothing. Wee have been forced to use more lime about the Fort than we thought for, soe shall be in want of a hogshead more to finish the spur, which I desire with the gate."
2370,3,732,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,20/06/1694,Fort,RAC,"This is to desire on accompt of the Royall African Company of England one hundred & fifty perpetuanoes blue, with the men & necessaries desired in my last. I desire they may be sent the first opportunity of fare weather."

2376,3,738,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,12/07/1694,Fort,RAC,"According to your orders of the 9th instant I have been att Agga and have rated the sayes as you will finde per inclosed certificate. The Briganteen, Capt. Bradshaw, is arrived att Amersa, which will be loaded as soon as the seas be downe. If you please to order him to putt thirty butts of shells on shore here, which may be burnt with little or no charge, the Fort may be repaired as it should be. It is soe farr gone to ruine that it cannot be repaired with the lime sent from Cabo Corso without a great deale more charge. The little tower over the staircase is soe cracked with the raines, being built only with swish, that if it be not covered over with lime & haire it will certainly fall in the latter raines. Besides the hall & the seconds roome must be taken up, which will take a great deale of lime, and many other repairs wanting, which may be soon done if we had materialls, lime is the cheifest. I desire the gate for the spurr."
2377,3,739,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,17/07/1694,Fort,RAC,"According to your orders of the 13th instant I have been at Annishan and inventoried the Royall Companys concernes, and Mr John Pinck have received the same into his possession. The goods are but little damaged more than before, but the upper warehouse has been broak open, the seale of the window & doore broak, and likewise a great place in the sealing [= ceiling] of the roome. The goods wanting are 10 perpetuanoes, one say, two lead barrs & two pautkies, as you will finde by the inclosed inventories. I told Captain Cuffee what you wrote, he says he will make an inquiry and beleives he may finde the theif. He says he panyard two perpetuanoes from a black who told him he bought them of me, the same are still in his possession and he beleives he shall find that fellow guilty, but I beleive him to be a subtile rogue. Thomas Farmer went in at the place that was broak at the sealing to naile up the window as he told us, which is all I can advise you of it. When Capt. Bradshaw has thirty butts of shells on board he may saile hither & putt them on shore, then fall down and take his loading againe if you please to order it soe. Inclosed is ten angles & four taccoes, being the estate of Robert Knightly deceased, which I charged in my last accompts. His old clothes just satisfied those which he was indebted to.
PS. I desire the spur gate with one hogshead lime to sett it in, as I may have it finished before wee burn the shell."
2378,3,740,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,19/07/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date with the nailes & staples I have received, which I have forwarded to Capt. Bradshaw. Per the 11 hand canoe have sent on accompt of the Royall Company twenty five chests corne."
2379,3,741,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,26/07/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdayes date I have received, and by the 11 hand canoe I have sent on accompt of the Royall African Company of England twenty one chests of corn & two men & one woman slaves. I have the shells on shore, and the Briganteen will saile downe to Amersa today. I desire the lent [= loan] of ten slaves, either men or women, to assist us in getting wood, and setting our kills to burne the lime for about fortnight, and then I will returne them. Capt. Bradshaw desires more staples, those he received are all used. I desire the carriages for our guns, with the other carpenters worke formerly desired. I have not above 3 gunns that are fitt for service. Alsoe some nailes, I have not a naile in the Fort what occasion soever we have of them."
2380,3,742,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,30/07/1694,Fort,RAC,"By this two hand canoe I send a woman slave which I received from Mr Cooper, and by returne of the same I desire on accompt of the Royall African Company of England ten redd perpetuanoes and one hundred two pound pewter basons. What pewter is here is soe fowle [= foul] that it will never sell."
2381,3,743,Edward Searle and William Cooper,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,02/08/1694,Fort,RAC,"This serves only to advise you that we hear that Tuesday morning before day the second of Cormantine by the Generall of the Mines order went upp secretly to

the Braffo of Fantine, under a pretence to goe a fowling, on what intreague we cannot rightly understand. We have heard various reports, some say it was to gett the Fantiners to assist Great Taggee of Aguaffo against the Quifferas, others that it was to tell him that the Generall heard that the English had hired him to take Cormantine Fort and desired him to certifie him of the truth, but rather beleive it to be some designe against us, the Braffo & Currantiers haveing been lately very huffish. This we thought needfull to advise you of."
2382,3,744,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,07/08/1694,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys my July accompts. The second of Cormantines message to the Braffo was that the Generall had heard that the English had given him and the Currantiers a considerable summe of money to surprise their Fort, which the Braffo assured him was very false. This as farr as I can learn was the reason of his goeing up, but however I shall be very cautious of the Blacks. I desire the spurr gate may be sent downe, with some sparrs and deale boards for scaffolding, and that the great canoe may be loaded with what bricks she can carry, soe that the bricklayer may doe all things about the Fort as can be done without a carpenter. The briganteene is loaded, and the canoes are here. They are very old, if you please to order them up shall send them. I have satisfied the Braffo and Cabbosheers of this place with old knives for their customes of cutting small corne, but the Currantiers would not take any, nor the vallue in other goods, but will have good knives or nothing. Their due is two dozen."
2383,3,745,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,08/08/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date with the gate of our spurr I have received. Corne I have not to load the canoe, soe sent her to Mr Cooper. I have returned in her the four window cases, being of noe service here. The window case desired was for our prison, which should be very strong. I desire the canoe may be returned with bricks &ca as I wrote yesterday, and will endeavour to gett corne to load her up. Here are noe barrs or staples or anything to the gate. I desire an iron barr & staples, and hooks for two wooden barrs. He that made the gate can give the smith the length to make the iron barr.
[PS] Our lime is burning. The bricklayer desires a si[e]ve to sift it as he takes it in, soe desire a sive may be sent by a slave. I have not a slave to send, or would have sent one for it."
2384,3,746,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,09/08/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdayes date with the bricks & boards I have received. Inclosed is the dementions of the timber worke we want, and noe more than what we have just necessity for. The guns, none of the five can be fired till we have the carriages. I desire six peices of timber that are fitting for the joyce of a roome, and I have a Black fellow here which will take up the second's roome well enough, and till it be done we cannot fire the gunns that stands on that roome, and for the hall I hope that by that time all the fort is repaired you may have a carpenter to send down and take up that. Corne I am afraid will be at an excessive rate after once it is housed. The neighbouring countrys being at great want, here are continually forty or fifty Mina canoes buying corne. I shall endeavour, as soon as it is fitting to take in, to purchase the quantity ordered."
2385,3,747,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,15/08/1694,Fort,RAC,"This is to desire on accompt of the Royall African Company of England one hundred & fifty perpetuanoes blue, fifty ditto red, and four hundred one pound pewter basons. I desire I may not faile of them early in the morning."

2388,3,750,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,22/08/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdayes date wee have received. Corne what wee gett att present is very inconsiderable, the Mina people buying such great quantities as well as all other provitions, which will cause a great scarcety. Our endeavours shall not be wanting, but doe fear shall not gett it under 2a per chest. Slaves it cannot be expected wee shall gett (and the ship is in your parts) att the prizes you formerly ordered, 2oz on board, being better then 2oz 8a ashore, considering the prizes of the goods, but doe believe if wee may give 2oz a man and 7 peaze a woman wee may purchase what are to be had here."
2389,3,751,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,22/08/1694,Fort,RAC,"By this two hand canoe goes William Reeves, an impertinent mutinous fellow. Last night happened a difference between John Ladd and the Serjeant. Ladd being very troublesome I putt him in prison to keep them quiett. A while after this Reeves & two more of our fellows were designing to take him from thence per force, and told me they would not be kept prisoners, as they say they are, because I order them none shall goe any distance from the Fort, without my knowledge, any further than to gett provitions, for when they had their liberty then all ran out of the fort att a time, and gott drunk with palme wine, that I had noe government amongst them. The other two craveing pardon, pretending they were in drinck, and Reeves being very sawsey [= saucy], I have given him condigne punishment for an example to the rest.
PS. Had not Mr Cooper & Mr Pinck both been here, I doe not know what such rogues might have pretend[ed] to have done, soe thought such a thing unsufferable to pass, and I desire a very civill fellow in his roome, and if you will please spare me more I should be very glad, and then the men might have more liberty with safety."
2390,3,752,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,24/08/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 22d instant I have received. Slaves what offers here we buy, but when they can have more on board, they will not offer them to us. Corne the Mina people buyes soe much, that makes them they care not how little they bring us, because of them they have gold, and as they tell me above 2a the chest. I shall endeavour to gett the quantity ordered, if I can bring them to comply at la 6ta. If you have any blue plaines I desire them if never soe few, either good or damaged if rated accordin[g]ly. Sayes I cannot put off one, they will not take them at loz."
2391,3,753,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,27/08/1694,Fort,RAC,"This is only to desire to be advised if I may sell English carpetts for sixteen a bendy, haveing money here for some and cannot sell them for more, the Negroes saying they can have them soe on you."

The carriages for the gunns are all to wide, I desire a carpenter to fitt them. The bricklayer tells me he shall want one thousand of bricks to repaire the Fort, I desire a canoe may be returned with as many as they can bring. One spur is finished, but have noe barrs or staples to fasten the gate withall. I desire four quarters for joyce for the seconds roome, fourteen foot long & seaven inches deep, with a quarter cask tarras, and that will be the first thing repaired, because it will not beare the gunns that stand on it to be fired till it is done. I desire alsoe what men yon can spare me, and a surgeon, we being daily an charge sending for the Dutch Doctor. If any blue pautkeys I desire two or three hundred. I desire you will please to order how I shall send the ballance of my accompts and in two or three dayes shall send them. Mr Cooper desires the same likewise."
2394,3,756,Edward Searle,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,07/09/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdays date I have received.

Mr Coopers & Mr Pincks gold is likewise in the chest. I desire the dore & window cases as soon as possible, with hooks, barrs & staples convenient, or that you will order me to have the ironworke made here by the Blacks, for we have neither gates nor dores that we can fasten as they should be, which if we should have occasion may finde the want of it. The prison doore & window I desire may be very good timber, & strong barrs putt in them. Corne now they have done worke I finde very plenty. I have taken almost three hundred chests besides what I have alreddy delivered, and have not yett forbidd them bringing in, soe that if you please to have any more purchased now will be the time for this yeare."

What good his comeing downe has done is that now he is able to satisfie you what we are in want of, which is much better to be done here than att Cabo Corso, for what they make there doe not fitt the place they are made for. I desire it may be done out of hand. He can satisfie you how badly we are provided. I desire an iron barr for the prison doore, three more large square staples, & as many hooks for wooden barrs. I desire on accompt of the Royall Company three or four bales of blue plaines, two bales of English woollen carpetts, & one case of half blue long cloths to be sent tomorrow.

The case of Guiney cloutes I received the 8th instant contains noe more then one hundred and thirty eaighte. By the bearer I have sent 01 oz 13a gold in exchange of what you returned me for bad money.

The reason their was more corne in the inventorey then in the accompts was that wee mist cast [= miscast] the goods disposed on and in makeing up my accompts I found the error. The Guiney cloutes I opened my selfe, soe can give noe other certificate then my owne. This is to advise you that our hall is open. Wee found another small girder of sixteen foot long decayed, that it will hardly beare its own waite [= weight]. The carpenter desier[s] either Bastien or the white carpenter to assist him for foure or five days to gett upp the gurders and to fitt in the joyces. A gurder I found heare, one which was left in Mr Cross's time. If you please to send Bastian by land, he may returne by land againe a Saterday night. If wee have not some other assistance our hall will be long open, and if raines should happen wee shall receive much damage, our warehouse being underneath.

The garders are up and the joyces are layde, soe according to your order I have returned Bastion and all the slaves except 3 which wee cannot be without them, and as soon as possible shall return them all. The old boards about the Forte will not cover our woork, soe humble desire the boards a Munday morning, that the Forte may be repaired at once as it should be, and then it will not want [for] maney years. If not, to put such rotten boards as wee shall be forced to doe will spend the lime and tarries to noe purpose. The roome over the cookroome must likewise be taken up to put in two large joyces which are heare for that purpose, wee hardly dare walk on it. Besides a great maney other places will want boards, to teadious to trouble you, which if I have necessaries the Forte shall be repaired as it ought to be, but if they are not to be had I hope I shall not be blamed heareafter. The carpenter and bricklayers doe not set any time. I told them that you wrote and asked them in what time they judged it would be done, all they told me it would be at the end of the next month, but I will forward them as much as possible. If you cannot possible spare soe maney boards pray send what you can, wee must make the best shift wee can to cover the cookroome.

I would willingly [ms. 'willing by'] send my five hand canoe to Annishan for the corne, but have already lend her to Mr Cooper to Winneybah, from when she's not yet returned.
PS. I request your order for a green perpetuano to cover the great chair [&?] the table in the hall."
2427,3,789,John Rootsey,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,02/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday came downe here an interloper, a Briganteene, who as I am told by the Blacks offers 4a per chest for corne, soe fear shall gett none whilst he is here. Bonyshee & Humphry both promissed me some on Munday next, on the latter I depend but the other I fear will not comply with his word. I can make noe accompt for this last month, haveing taken but verry little money. I have here six women slaves, five of them being bought by William Cooper, the other by my selfe.
PS. I have forst the above mentioned interlooper out of road by firing 2 shott att him, but that will not fright him quite away, he now la[y]ing out of shot of the Castle."
2428,3,790,John Rootsey,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,13/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday Bonnishee informed me that the Dutch had been tampering with the Curanteers and sent them severall bendys gold and some cases liquor to side with them against Taggee. The Curanteers have not only refused their mony &ca but have with the Braffoe's made a palaver that the Dutch or Mina canoes for future shall not be supplyed with corne, or any sent to the Castles. They have also opened the way that the people may bring their corne to our Castle, for which they demand of me two cases spirrits, for which must waite your orders. I hope now to supply you with corne enough. I have sent up five  pieces slaves irons which are broake, and desire that the bomboy may be ordered to send others in their roome, with soome spare rivetts.
PS. By this canoe have sent 10 chest come."
2429,3,791,John Rootsey,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,15/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"The Cabbosheers told me this morning that they canot send their people to assist Taggee for want of powder and desire you will supply them, for the payment of which they will give gold pawne. They alsoe expect youle give them some for a dashe before they goe, which as they say will be on Sunday next, I understand they designe by the way of Saboe. Tho they talke soe much of going I as much doubt it, by reason they say Taggee has given them nothing, but if you please to send downe powder it will be ready here for them or what other use you please to order it."
2430,3,792,John Rootsey,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,19/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"According to your desire have sent my five hand canoe and am glad I have her to serve you. The Blacks at Cormantyne have deserted the towne that lyed about the Castle and say noe blacks shall come in nor noe Dutch men come out of the Castle. This morning came downe one of their [i.e. Dutch] ships, as I suppose landed their Chiefe."
2431,3,793,John Rootsey,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,22/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"I understand you have gott the two great canoes from the Dutch againe, therfore desire you'l be so kind to order mine downe againe, & if any tyme you want, she shall be at your service."
2432,3,794,John Rootsey,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,03/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"With this you'l receive my accompts for the last two months, by which you'l see I have had a verry bad trade. I wish the next two months may have better, but I much doubt it, by reason the people are all gorne to the warrs. If must buy any more corne desire you'l renue your order, the last being near compleated, wherein you gave me power to give two angles a chest, and its not easely procured at that rate. I have sent per the bearer one ounce gold, which stopt from Serjeant Clements in part of 2 months sallary advanced him in England, the rest he will pay the next pay day. He complains that he has been short paid 2a 2_ ta each pay day since his arrivall, he haveing received but 1oz 8a 10_ta & his due is 1oz 12a 1ta, which is 2 months att 40 per anno."
2433,3,795,John Rootsey,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,08/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"By the bearer have sent my accompts for February & March & the ballance, which is 4oz 3_ta. The Curenteers demand of me 1oz 8a for thre months pay, if you allow of it please to order it & it shall be paid."
2434,3,796,John Rootsey,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,11/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"This comes to acquaint you of Mr Wiliam Gudges death, at the hour of 7 last night. I am going [i.e. to Anashan] to see him intered, and shall take care to see the warehouse secur'd and Mr Gudges owne goods till receive orders from you."
2435,3,797,John Rootsey,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,12/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"After I had seen Mr Gudge inter'd, seal'd the warehouse dore, & have herewith
sent the key. I draw'd out of one of the quarter casks four flagons rum to give the Cabbosheers, the Blacks that fired, and the grave diggers. I have sent an accompt of his cloathes &ca. I found noe more gold then 12a 4ta, which I weigh'd & seal'd up, our Serjeant and Thomas Farmer being present, and have sent it by the bearer with a fuzee & silver headed cane, which would not goe into his chist. Mr Gudge sold me a woman slave for six peaz, the money is still due to him, except 10a which he is indepted to me, being mony lent him when he first took possestion of Annishan Factory. What I have done is without order, but I hope you'l not disaprove of it.
PS. I took 1 sheet out of the warehouse to bury him in. The 2 Cabbosheers that used to supply me with corne [have] been with me this morning, and say they will have 3a per chest, or else they will not bring corne in, because they tell me can make 4a per chest & sell itt per the taccoe to the Cabo Corso people. If you allow of that price please to advise. I have had a long palaver with them about their asking so extravagant a rate but it signifies little, they knowing your necessity and they will have their own price and what goods they please."
2436,3,798,John Rootsey,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,15/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"This comes to acquaint you that I canot gett corne, not soe much as will feed the slaves here, haveing already feed them with English peese three days, which I bought of Mr Salmon, therfore desire you will be pleased to send for them. Three of the women have been sick of the flux, which hath made them verry thinn. If you please to order me to give 3 angles per chest, I beleive can gett some small quantity more (but not much). Bonnyshee tells me that .[ms. 'to'] those men that have corne are gone to the camp, but my opinion is they have sold most of their corne, and will want them selves if the rain doth come not suddenly to produce their other sort of provitions. I waite your orders.
PS. I desire to know if you have any slaves that are runn away. I hear of an Arda slave taken up about Ammessa and have sent for him."
2437,3,799,John Rootsey,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,16/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours by Cabbosheer Hansicoe have received, and according to your order will assist him in the palavra for corne as much as I can, and when we have done what we can, the Cabbosheers of this towne have not any corne but what they buy for themselves, except one man who demands 3a per chest, who is at his croome in the country, but have sent for him, that Hansicoe may ask his reason why he demands so extravagant a rate. I hartily wish could supply you, I assure you I have used my endeavours, and could I attaine them it would be to my reputation. You will receive by this canoe 9 women and 2 men slaves, 5 of which bought by Mr Cooper and the rest by me, as apears by my last accompt."
2438,3,800,John Rootsey,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,18/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"Here are some traders come downe with money. They want blue perpetuanoes, sheetts and powder, therfore desire you'l please to send of each sort to this factory, as soone as this comes to hand, the people now staying for them. I desire may have them blue perpetuanoes out of Annishan Factory.
PS. Hansicoe has been verry sick but is now better."
2439,3,801,John Rootsey,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,21/04/1695,Fort,RAC,This is to acquaint you that have received from on board the Guiney Galley three hundred and ninety sheets.
2440,3,802,John Rootsey,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,23/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"With this have sent two men & one boy slaves, the boy at 1oz 4a. The man slave which I wrote you of that was taken up about Amessa have sent for, and as soon  as the messenger came into the towne he (I beleive) was conveyed away, tho they say he made his escape. The place where he was taken up is a days journy to leaward of this. I suppose Hensicoe told you of 20 chests, 10 of great & 10 small corne. which I was promised should be brought in next Thursday at 3a per chest, soe desire you order I shall take it or not.
PS. I have taken all the spirritts, being 8 cases, & the blue perpetuanoes from Annishan, being 27_ & desire you'l be pleased to sent me 200 blue perpetuanoes more."
2441,3,803,John Rootsey,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,24/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"Three of the 4 women slaves you return'd belong to Mr William Cooper, which I have sent downe to him. Mr Searle told me when I received any slaves from Agga it was to secure them, this being a garrison, and I am not oblig'd to make them good if not merchandable. I presume Mr Cooper would have taken it verry ill of me if I had told him (when he sent them) they were not merchandable, of which you are the only judges. Besides the slaves were sent here before Mr Searle left the place, which cann prove by Mr Coopers notes to him, and he did not deliver command of the factory to me till he tooke his leave at the gates, so that damage lies rather more on him then me. I give you a more particular accompt because Mr Searle told our Doctor that since they were left in my custody, [I] was oblig'd to macke them good, but that in my judgment is an error. Had they all died I presume it is on the Companys accompt & not mine. In the roome of the slaves you return'd belonging to me have sent another woman that I bought of Mr Gudge, because I would not be at the trouble of altring my accompts, haveing already entred them in my books. I hope Mr Cooper will do the like without any further trouble, haveing also given him credit in my accompts for five women. I received by the canoe one hundred perpetuanoes. Just as the canoe came to shoare the seas run so high that fill'd her with water and the perpetuanoes were verry wett. I have opened & dried them all, so hope they'l sell for not less. We want a canoe for this place verry much, soe desire your order whether shall charge this five hand canoe that I have to the Company in my next accompt at 3oz 4a, being less then she cost me, she being employed in the Companys service altogether. Mr Searle told me alsoe that you allowe of a canoe for this place, which is the reason I mention it. soe hope you'l grant it."
2442,3,804,John Rootsey,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,29/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"The enclosed I broke open (unawares), thinking it had been for me, which error I hope you'l excuse. The man that was employed to cutt the 20 sticks wood which lately was sent from Annashan hath been with me severall tymes for his money. He demanded 5 angles, but have brought him to four, which if you'l please to order will pay. I have taken in yet butt 5 chests corne, which I thinck is too little to send you by the five hand canoe. Tomorrow I expect the other 15 chests which I write you is promissed."
2443,3,805,John Rootsey,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,01/05/1695,Fort,RAC,"According to your orders have sent five chest corne in a two hand canoe. I doubt the man that promised will not be so good as his word to bring in small corne. I am verry lame with the gout in my right hand, and what herein you find amiss please to excuse.
PS. Please to send per first opportunity a baile blue pautkies."
2444,3,806,John Rootsey,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,27/05/1695,Fort,RAC,"According to your orders have removed all the goods of Annishan factory, & desire you will be pleased to send me the inventory that was taken when Mr Gudge first went there, that may know what damage is sett on them. Most of the tallow which came from thence is very bad, the casks standing soe long on one head that they are rotten & some of them much eaten by the ratts. I was forsed to be att a great expence when the Cufferoes were routed, the town people breinging me between 2 & 300 heads (as near as I can judge), & with abundance of alacrity told me they fought not only for their one [= own] intrest but ours alsoe, soe hope you'l allow me to charge in my accompt for it. Some days since the Fanteniers pinjard some of the Saboe people on Little Tagee for a Fanteen man which he keeps off. The Saboers did the like on the Cape Coast people, & [the latter] sent them here to redeem them, & as one of them was comeing by our Castle [she] run in for refuge, on which the Cabbosheers came all in & demanded her but I peacefied them & have sent the woman by the bearer. They desire you'l please to order Taggee to deliver him in their case.
[PS] One of the musketts which was att Annishan Captain Cofee owns, soe left itt because would have noe trouble with him when removed the things."
2445,3,807,John Rootsey,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,28/05/1695,Fort,RAC,"This morning stood into our road a large shipp which showed both Dutch & English collors & put the interloper into a consternation, judgeing her to be a French man of warr, on which he came under our Castle & desired protection. The merchant of her is come on shoar & with him two trunks & a deske. What is in them I know not, but pursuant to your orders shall secure both him & them till hear from you.

Its one of corner guns, which on occasion must clear the front part of the Fort, and we have no other gunn small enough to put in its place. Have also sent up nine musquetts which are unservicable, and desire they may either be refitted or exchang'd. I have sent Serjeant Clements with them, he desireing it, haveing a litle business at Cabo Corso Castle as he says, that he may forward the smith to dispatch them. We want severall other things for the forts use which have undermentioned. I shall observe your orders to suply Edward Barter with what goods he wants, he hath already had three chests sheets. Least I should want. I desire youl please to send per the canoe six chests sheets, & when the Serjeant returnes 4 quarther cask rum for to pay the danceing custome & for factory use. I have been verry much indisposed with the gout both in feet & hands. I am not yet quite recovered; which you may see by my handwriting, thats the reason have not sent my accompts for Aprill & May; but hope you shall suddanly have them.

I supose you are not unsensable of my indisposition, first the gout & now a feavour & ague, attended with a verry sharp tumor in my rig[h]t eye, which alsoe is the reason you have not my June accompts. If could sett to make them you may be assured should have them now and the ballance, which I supose would be 4 marques att least. I have sold all the blue perpetuanoes that are good, and some red. I desire you'l please to send me some more red perpetuanoes, sheets, and a baile of blue pautkies by Mr Ronans boy Hector. When he returnes will send a women slave in the roome of that you return'd.

They proposed that the towne Cabboshees should have 2a 4ta per chests, & I should buy of the boores as cheap as I could, by which meanes all the corn in the country would belong to them. Bonyshee demands on Taggees accompts, which I formerly advised you of, nine ounces gold in sayes & iron, & one case of spirritts.

The Dutch contriveing to ruine the King of Aguaffo, have offered them considerabily to stand neuter, but they refused it, and as soon as they heard of my being there, came away from them. The Copeman of the Mina with Ackim are still at Cormanteen, the latter I may chance [to] trapan tomorrow.
The Generall hath promised the King of Saboe to send him the Copeman of Morea for a pawne, if he would send his two sons for a pledge to stand neuter, but that King I hope is a better fri[e]nd to us. They tell the Natives they have Cabes Terra & Danckaras to deale with the King of Aguaffo, but I realy believe the intrest they are makeing is to divert them from sideing with the King of Aguaffo from takeing their Forts. However if it should be true, these people ressolving to stand by the King of Aguaffo will discouradge the Danckaras & all others from making any more warrs this way. Pray send me another flask brandy, & two or 3 booties of wine; here is not a drap left, & were it not by good chance that Mr Rootsey had soome rumm, know not what I should have done."

William Reves, a hired ship by the Company as they tell mee, & bound to the Bite [= Bight], where they were loaded with slaves, & in their way to Barbadoes was taken by a French privateer, haveing on board 360 slaves. They also give an accompt of an English interloper that came to the Bite one day after them either in the month of February or March, they cannot exactlly tell because they are but saylers and keept no accompt. One of them by name Edward Baily hath agreed with mee and entred himselfe in the Companys service for soldiers pay, and if any service for him in ships on the Coast he doth rely on you for further advancement. Enoch Checkery the other desires to goe home in the Fauconberg. What I have done I hope you'l not mislike, and I desire you'l please to lett him continue here in the roome of Henry Underhill, who is almost blind with both eyes with age, and not able to doe duty. The Dutch interloper waites for your packett, which only [ = alone] delays him as he pretends, but am told he waites also for the Mine pakett."
2493,3,855,John Rootsey,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,26/02/1696,Fort,RAC,"I spoke [ms 'spose'] to Bonnyshee about the Dankra mans slave, and told him he was in possession of one of his blacksmiths, [he] flue [= flew] into a passion and told me I should have desired him to look for him, and also you should have sent one [of] your boys with your cane to make a pallaver, and thereby he would have gott somthing, and so have made himself igniorant of the matter, which is the old rogues common practice, because I told him where he was entertained. He says he will not come againe into the Castle and if he be as good as his word it will be both for the good of the Company and our selves that live here. Our white men and the Companys slaves particularly have been abused and beaten by the blacks severall times. I bare it all on accompt of the war, or els would have some of them in irons ere this time, and if it were not for the 2 factorys, would immediately serve them the same as Mr Grigory did. If it were not for those reasons noe man could bare the affronts which I have had, but must pass all by, and waite with patience for better times.

I desire you would not believe every black that runns up with a story, tho am fool enough somtimes, yett my folly was never so great as to tell anyone that I heed your orders unless it were true, and I have been so far from threatning the blacks (lately) to doe by them as Mr Grigory did, that I have not thought of it, but Bonnyshees guilty conscience accuses him, and to find out if any such thing was designed I suppose sent to learn what he could. I am sure he deserves that and more. I have had one of the Companys slaves run away, an [ms. 'and'] Arda woman, one of the 10 which have charged in my accompts. She cannot speak this countrey language, nor doth she know the countrey, therefore am sure she must be stole or privately keept by some of the townes people. I have used my endeavours with them to gett her againe, but all is in vaine, for they doe what they please, because they are and think dare not be called to an accompt for them. I shall take care to be so wise as not to neglect the Companys bussiness, all false[hoods] as what the blacks has informed you, shall not trouble me, knowing what sort of people they are in this place. I shall follow your orders as to Captain Quo. As it has been alwayes my endeavour to live peaceably amongst the natives, soe you shall not find me only to promote it, but to continue it if it lies in my power. I have not else to add but beg your excuse for my bad scribling, haveing the gout in my right thumb, that I cannot hold a pen fast."

2501,3,863,John Brown,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,22/04/1697,Fort,RAC,"This is to advise you that Bonnyshee tells me that his people are still busied in weeding and planting of corne, soe that it will be 20 or fifteen dayes at soonest, ere he can sett them to digg shell. Others tell me this is not really the cause of their want, but that their is difference between Bonnyshee and one Quashee at Amersa, who has been hitherto concerned, soe it is like there can be none procured till the disputes are ended. Bonnyshee alledges he [= Quashee] has no right, and wants to engross them all into his own hands."

It is also come to my ears what was reported this morning by an Arcany man to severall in the town, vizt that Cuthequa, the King of the Arcaneys, intends to the assistance of Little Taggee, that he is on martch and almost as far as Abramboe, with a party of soldiers. It is said their designe is first to fall upon Fattue, and that there are two women who upon pretence of selling tobacco there [who] are only sent to observe in what posture of deffence the Fatures remaine at present, and what watches they keep in the night.

This comes to advise that the Captain of Abra sends me word he hath not as yett found a convenient opportunity for displaceing the Braffoe, but does watch an occation, which he hopes will not be long. He hath already so lessened his power by sundry occations, he sayes, to his charge of a secrett underhand correspondance he hath kept with Little Taggee, for advancing that intrest and carrying on of warr, that the country in generall are much insenced against him, and doe but little notice or regard him, the consequence whereof, he is very apprehensive to be dangerous, and suspects so mightily the ill treatment he is likely to meet with, through the means of the Captain [of] Abra, that he begins to studdy new methods to regain his creditt amongst the people, and to save himself from being quite outplaced. He frequently tell them in his publick pallavers that since the quarrell Little Taggee hath undertaken is inconsistant with the wellfare and constitution of this country, he therefore disowns and avoues never to be concerned therein, and taking notice that a great many of his people harbour jealousies to the contrary, and that upon accompt of his being related to Little Taggee, by consaring a sister of his, itt is not to be expected but that he will privately favour his intrest so far as he can, but to put an end to this suspition he hath turned her from him [ms. 'his'], disallowing her as his wife.
PS. Pray send one redd perpetuanoe to make a flagg."

2516,3,878,Richard Sheldon,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,09/11/1697,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday morning the Braffo sent to advise me that he is resolved to fight Captain Dominy, the reason [is] he would not deliver up the money that the Dutch had gave the said Captain to helpe Little Taggee, likewise the slaves that runn to him being the late Bralfoes. The bearer Edward Bayly, being very sick, desired leave to come up, which I have presumed to give, I hope with no offence."

when Mr White went downe to take the shells aboard, they would not lett him have any under 1_a per but, being bigger then usually used to be. Sirs, if you order him to goe further to leward for shells, I desire to know whither the seaven hand canoe must be sent up or proceed with him. The Braffoe sent this morning to acquaint me that Captain Dominee will deliver up the money and slaves, so the palaver is made up."

I have this day sent my boy to the Braffoe, to desire to send a party of men downe to secure Quoman to him, for fear he should meet with a rescue by the way. At my boys returnes I will give your Worshipps a further accompt, in the meane time I will secure him here from makeing an escape."

I have hired this canoe to carry Finnee up with the Braffoes man, the Braffoe desireing it, for fear he might be panyard in goeing near Mowree by land. Finnee can informe you of the Braffoes message, therefore think it needless to express it here. This evening here came two Dutch interlopers to anchor."

The Braffoe desires a mark of perpetuanoes, to give the Fantiners to help and assist him. I told the Braffoes man I could not lett him have any, having no orders. One of the Braffoes men continues here till I receive your orders. I was informed by Eggin that the new Captain of Abra sent to Quashadoe, Captain of the towne, to know whose side he was for, and his answer was for the English. All the Cabbosheers of the towne declare they will help and assist the Braffoe to the utmost of their power.

The quantity of corne I have, besides the 20 chests sent up, is 82. There is plenty of it but the people are now rowsawing, which is the occasion of their slowness in bringing it in. Inclosed is my accompt made up according to the inventory.
PS. Desire some cartridge paper, having none."
2537,3,899,Richard Sheldon,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,07/04/1698,Fort,RAC,This accompanyes my accompt with its ballance due to the Royall Company.

I have asked his leave to come up to the Doctor, and he will not grant me, so I humbly begg that your Worshipps will grant me that favour, where I shall relate the whole circumstance of the matter to your Worshipps, as you find it so proved, which being all, begging your Worshipps pardon for this my scribble."

PS. I am informed by the Blacks that one white man has left Winneba and is gone to Apom, where he now continues."
2541,3,903,Kendall Hutson,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,27/04/1698,Fort,RAC,"This is a small accompt of what I heard since my arivall here, that affter enquiry from severall of the Blacks could not find the Cabbosheers were anywayes designed against the Braffoe. This morning after the intreaty gott the Captain of the Towne in, and affter drinking a sneaker of punch with him, he arose of his own accord and called me aside to know what news from Cabo Corso. I answered as that there was no more then that the Gentlemen frowed him and the rest ackey, and ordered me to be kind to him, and hope that he would be true to the Braffoe &ca. He told me that the Braffoes heart and his were all as one. I told him that I had heard from Cabo Corso amongst the Blacks that there was some ill designe amongst them against the Braffoe, but if so they had better lett it alone. I find that the generous Coapman has been feeing of the Blacks to stand by him here, and that Mr Newman is a very great assistant to him for news out of the accompting house. It is a thing I had without enquiery from the Serjeant. I also gott out of Eggin last night that there was severall of the Fantiners gone already to assist the Arcanyes, and that they was all for the same cause save the Braffoe, so that I feare there is some ill in hand. The Cabbosheers are I feare guilty, by their slyness of coming to the fort. Worthy Sirs, this is what I thought my duty to advise.
PS. Since the sealing up of this the Captain of the interloper sent his mate ashore to me for protection. I sent him word I would do what I could, having but 2 gunns that would beare upon him, but if he would send his gold on shore I would take care of itt."
2542,3,904,Kendall Hutson,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,28/04/1698,Fort,RAC,"Affter a small conferrance with Peter Quashee last night, found that tis' too sure that the Blacks will have the Braffoes head off, if they can, and that before the Dankeryes and Arcanyes fight if possible, that they may be all as one to assist the Arcanyes if they runn to their parts. The Dutch, who seldome lye idle in such cases, has certainly a hand in this, for their Coapman of Cormantine had been up about a fortnight agoe at Quaman. The Captain of Annamaboe Bentifoes and Banbeiree as I am informed is both the Braffoes cozens, and informes him of all pallavers from this towne. At my first coming here the blacks seemed to be much for Mr Sheldon, but since his departure from hense I find that they doe but laugh at all his liberallityes which he bestowed on them, and that another man may be respected here as well as he. The Braffoes cozen is up with the Dankeryes already as I am informed. As yett there is noe men of repute gone to assist the Arcanyes from those parts, save a few poore scoundrell doggs, not any Cabbosheers. They are certainly affraid of the Dankeryes, butt putt the best side outward. Wee are weakly manned here if should have occation. I had but one barrell and a halfe of powder from Mr Sheldon, being all in the fort. I have gott one quire of cartridge paper from Capt. Osborne by much adoe. Captain Hansicoe and Hector is just now come, and as yett not given their hands to the Cabbosheers, therefore cannot as yett give any accompt of what they will say to them. Here is just now a Dutch Company shipp engaged with the interloper that came downe yesterday. He has sent me a note ashore which I understand not, the which have returned by Peter Quashee, and desire him to send by word of mouth.
PS. Pray send me a pen or two and the cartridges I wrote for. The Dutchman is comeing under our protections, which is but small. I wish he is not served like Towres by his men."
2543,3,905,Charles Salmon,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,06/05/1698,Fort,RAC,"Yesterday affter you went to Cabo Corso Castle, I went to Agga folowing your Worshipps orders, at which time Mr Sheldon went out here into the towne at Annamaboe, for at my coming back from Agga I missed him. Affter a short time he came into the fort, and at night I nott having any lodging provided, was goeing to Aggah to sleep, charging the Serjeant and the souldiers to keep a good watch, but Mr Sheldon growing very contentious, saying he was then Cheife of the fort, and unless he had the keys and other things usually delivered him, he would sleep in the towne, I told him he had no business in the towne, unless he was goeing to counsell some accomplices, to which he answered what a plague was that to me if he did? I replyed that I would prevent all unjust desines, and commanded the Serjeant to bring him in from the outward gate and imprison him. I have likewise information that he has been broaching some designe with the Cabbosheers, but what it is I cannott yett find out. Nevertheless I doe intend to send him up this morning to Cabo Corso, I being assured there will be no good come of his staying here. I shall make it my business to enquire into all pallavers and give your Worshipps an accompt of them."
2544,3,906,Charles Salmon,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,07/05/1698,Fort,RAC,"Tomorrow God willing, I will send up two more coppyes of the inventory of Annamaboe, with what news I heard. The Blacks at Agga did a great dayes work yesterday, by which find that which I thought to have been a round bastian to prove a square one. As soone as the other is cleared I will send your Worshipps the figure and dementions of the ground plott."
2545,3,907,Charles Salmon,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,08/05/1698,Fort,RAC,"Since my last to you by James Elliott, this morning the King of Sabboes man hath been here with a mesage from his master, which is this: when the two Kings of Sabboe and Aguoffoe were at variance, your Worshipps did then compose that difference to a mutuall friendshipp. and now you have sent for him lately to assist the Dankeryes, which he refused to doe, he finding now that you are displeased with him for it, in regard he sent you some palme wine, and you refused it, and sent it back to him againe, he still is resolved to assist the Arcanyes, and all his great reason is, that the gold which comes to the water side is called Arcany gold, not Dankery gold, the Arcanyes keeping their Captain[s] at all places of trade along the Coast, which the Dankeryes doe not, nevertheless he will assist your Worshipps with anything his country affords, he having a greater regard for the English then for the Dutch."
2546,3,908,Charles Salmon,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,08/05/1698,Fort,RAC,"These are to informe your Worshipps that the Blacks which went from this country with an intent to fight the King of Aguoffoe are all returned with silence. I am likewise informed that the Dankeryes and Arcanyes are not in any posture of joyning battle, these late bone dayes being past. There are severall of the Dankeryes runn to the Arcanys, as the report is, for want of food. The King of Sabboe is likewise gone to the assistance of the Arcanyes, who I am told have twenty great gunns from Quamboe, which were taken from the Deans fort at Accra, and likewise some from Labordee, which were lost in a Negro sloope of the Companyes there. All affairs in this towne seeme to be very still and quiett. I doe intend this day to send a messenger to the Braffoe, to know how the affairs are carryed on at Fantine, and will then give your Worshipps an accompt of them."
2547,3,909,Charles Salmon,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,08/05/1698,Fort,RAC,"Since my two former of this dayes date this bearer, the Braffos man, informed me that the Arcanyes are routed and fledd to the Aikims country. I therefore desire your speedy advice, what must be done if the Arcanyes should fly here for security."
2548,3,910,Charles Salmon,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,10/05/1698,Fort,RAC,"I have this day had intelligence that the Dankeryes have routed the Arcanyes, it comes by a Black which came this morning from Abra, and that no man can tell what is become of the Captain of Quaman, his sword bearer and kettesall [= kittysol] man being both come back, but know not what is become of their master. The Blacks this morning have proffered me two men slaves, and have confessed them to be Arcanyes. There is likewise a[t] Dominees house an Arcany man from the camp, wounded in the thigh by a shott, who confirmed that the Arcanyes are certainly routed. I humbly desire your Worshipps orders what to doe.
PS. There are two white men gone to Quamon from Cormanteen. Your boy Jack was with me this morning, and is gone to Abra. I humbly desire that the irons have been sent may be returned."
2549,3,911,Charles Salmon,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,17/05/1698,Fort,RAC,"I have just now received a message from the Braffoe, who [w]ants two perpetuanoes, and desires your Worshipps to use what intrest you can in the Dankeryes affaires to gett the Captain of Quamon to Cabo Corso Castle and keep him there untill he shall be brought to a fair complyance, on all accompts whatsoever. I understand that it is Dominyes mother hath been desireing the Braffoe to make this pallaver for him. Since last night that these two interlopers came into the roade, I have heard nothing of the slaves I had bargained for yesterday, which makes me think I shall purchase butt few, as long as they lye here. The Braffoe desires your speedy answer.
PS. I want two casks of rumme forts use."
2550,3,912,Charles Salmon,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,21/05/1698,Fort,RAC,"By this canoe comes twenty chests of corne, the canoe men being not willing to take in more, by reason the canoes bottome is bad. As for the Cabbosheers here they would not lett me rest, until I had paid their customs. They still seem to be in a consternation concerning the Dankeryes, altho' not all of them are soe, only those who I suppose have reason to fear a requiteall for their clandestine roagery. There are two particular men in this towne who privately tell me it will not be convenient that ever the Captain of Quamon be reduced to this country any more, in regard he will never leave his former projects, butt will undoubtedly be assisted and prompted by the Dutch to his former villanyes, which are like to those who sett him to work. Now these two mens advice is that instead of makeing a pallaver to gett this Captain of Quamon cleare, you make a pallaver to take his head off, and then the greatest enemie to the English intrest in Fantine will be past doeing any more hurt. I have sent to the Braffoe concerning corne but have not yett had answer.
PS. Tomorrow I will send Mr Browne the accompt he hath ordered &ca."
2551,3,913,Charles Salmon,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,27/05/1698,Fort,RAC,"By this bearer comes the inventoryes, and likewise Agga accompts for Aprill, which if itt is not according to method, I desire a speedy returne of itt, thatt this next week I may send up both itt and Annamaboe accompt together. As for gold there is none stiring, nor any other trade butt whatt these interlopers have, for which there is no remedy att present. The news that I hear is that the King of the Dankeryes hath sent word to the King of Sabboe thatt he will come and speak with him. The Cabbess country hath sent to the Braffoe, to desire his aid in the makeing of peace with the Dankeryes, who are in great quantitys in their


country, takeing what provitions they can find and plundering the people. I hear likewise that the King of Aguoffoe is threatned by the Dankeryes, for a breach of promise, and thatt the Quamboes have desired the Dankeryes to assist them against the Aikims. As for the Captain of Quaman I hear noe talk concerning him. The Braffoe is very well & promiseth to send corne the first fair weather. I stand in great need of the iron work I last wrote for, having nothing to keep the windows fast or the raine out. I have gott the warehouse made as firme from leakes as the present occation requires, and now want some lime to stopp up a few cracks in the tarris above where the raine soaks through and rotts the timber work. If the smiths have nott made the short hooks for the windows lett them be made butt 2 inches shank, and the staples as narrow as possible, that the hooks may nott have two [= too] much play. I pray God send us a Companyes shipp with a recruit of tradesmen, for Annamaboe when strictly searched will find a greate deale of worke to be done."
2552,3,914,Charles Salmon,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,03/06/1698,Fort,RAC,"This day the Fantine dancing beginns, and shall want rumme speedily. If the customes of Agga must be paid, I humbly desire notice of itt. As for the news thatt is now stirring, itt is much as itt was a fortnight since. Here is a Fantine man thatt was taken by the Dankeryes and has made his escape, he sayes that the Dankeryes have a full intent to fight with and ruine the Cabbess country, and then to fight the Fantines, this is all I can at present hear. I doe intend the first fair weather to gett all the come from Agga, nott intending to take in any more there. Two of the interlopers sailed this morning for Apom, the other stayes here to gett come, for as farr as I can find that he hath a very bad cargoe for slaves, most of his perpetuanoes being red and green, and his iron all thick square bars, which the Blacks knows not whatt to doe with."
2553,3,915,Charles Salmon,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,04/06/1698,Fort,RAC,"This day I am informed by Dominee thatt the Generall of the Mina hath given the Dankeryes 150 bendyes, and Adampo's mother hath given them two hundred bendyes more, to watch a private opportunity upon the King of Aguoffoe to murther him, any way thatt the opportunity might permitt off, the Dankeryes being to doe itt affter some time of trade with the English, that they
may be the least mistrusting, and likewise am informed thatt Egginsam the Arcany Cabbosheer is a prisoner to the Dankeries, being taken in the fight. Taggee Ancram is to be the great ingineer the Dankeryes are to work with.
PS. I humbly desire some more paper, for none of these shipps can spare me any."
2554,3,916,Charles Salmon,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,07/06/1698,Fort,RAC,"Both yours of the 6th instant I have received, and according to your orders have sent up Eggin and Aqua. As for the news I wrote in my last, I suppose ere this itt is confirmed to your Worshipps, by [ms. 'butt'] a Dankery man taken and brought to Dominees house, this man being sent up to Cabo Corso by Dominee on purpose to declare itt to you in full. I am likewise informed that there is to be a speedy meeting of the King[s] of Aguoffoe, Sabboe & [the] Braffoe to consult what is best to be done, in case the Dankerys should come upon them. I have by the 5 hand canoe sent 50 chests of corne from Agga.
PS. The slave that returned yesterday brought noe writeing paper with him."
2555,3,917,Charles Salmon,Anomabu,,Cape Coast Castle,23/06/1698,Fort,RAC,"By this bearer comes the Annamaboe accompts for May with the ballance. The slaves here complaine thatt Mr Sheldon did not pay them to the 22d of April last, as he wrote me he did, therefore I have sent one of them to recollect Mr Sheldon's memory, and likewise the accompt he sent me. This week I sent a messenger to the Braffoe, who informes me all things are well with him at present, and that he hath a great deale of corne to dispose off, when it shall be fitt to take in. If your Worshipps want any at present I can send up forty chests. I shall have the Braffoe downe here as soone as the Fantine dancing is past. He intends to bring some slaves with him if he can purchase them, therefore

The occation of their coming hither is this: the Cabbess people, haveing made a contract with the Dancra's for a certaine summe of money not to molest their country, have already paid the Dancra's some of their money, and because the Dancra's wait for the rest, and the Cabbess people being at present unfurnished with goods, therefore this Cabbosheer is come on purpose in behalfe of his country, to desire your Worshipps to trust him with the vallue of a hundred bendys in such goods as he shall want, but if you cannot doe itt then to trust him with the vallue of fifty bendy's. The Braffoe is come on purpose with him, being his cozen, to desire your Worshipps complyance to this proposall. He [the Caboceer of Cabess] hath brought with him for pawns his owne sone and his cozen that is his heir, and will likewise bring Quominah, Quashees sone, and they shall be sent to Cabo Corso Castle, and he sayes that as soone as the Dancra's are gone the trade will open all his part of the country, and he shall be able to pay you in short time, with what slaves you shall think fitt, there being now a great many in the country which he can procure, his croome lyeing just in the center of trade for the Arcany's, Dancras, Akims or any of the up country people, and this the Braffoe confirmes, and likewise that it lyes in his power to stopp all trade that comes into the Fantine country. This Cabbosheer tells me he would have been at Cabo Corsoe, but there are people there that sould a great many of his country men, when they went there for shelter in Mr Humphreys time, but he says that was not your fault, if you please to do him this great kindness he will always keepe friendshipp and good correspondence with the English, and if you doe not think his former pawns suffitient, he will pawne himself, and the Braffoe shall keep him, which the Braffoe hath promised to doe, and desires your Worshipps speedy answer to this pallaver, in regard he hath an intent to make a firme friendship between the English and Cabbess country, and says that now is the time to doe this."

As for the 18 chests of corne his man brought you my receipt for, he expects more then 2a per chest, saying you promised him more. The Braffoes man tells me that if I wrote to desire your presence you would come, but here is noe occation for soe great a trouble, besides I am soe lame that I cannott stirr off my bedd to the hammock without crutches, and then with a great deale of paine. I humbly desire your Worshipps answer to this, that I may dispatch the Braffoe away, who at this time is very troublesome to me."

The 30th June last he saw a great ship stand in for Cisters, and was then informed by Mr Carter of Barbadoes, who had spoke with the ship, she was on the Companys accompt, and he judged that by this time she might be on this side Cape Palmas. The Commanders name of this interloper is Michaell Mackfarson. He is now coming into this road to purchase some corne, and then to goe to leward with all speed.

Yesterday three of the Curranteers of this country was with me for their ground rent, which I proffered them in any goods that is in the Royall Companys warehouse. They want English sayes and sheets, they will nott take those here, because they are sullyed a little on the outside, therefore they desire your Worshipps to send them some new ones, two seys and four sheets will doe, which I can bring to my accompt, or Mr Gore to his, which you shall think fitt. It is three months rent that is due to them, from ultimo May to ditto August. I have been very importunate with them, to know the reason of this present want of trade. They tell me thatt as long as the Braffoe

Yesterday I opned the baill of boysadoes, whereof 7 are damaged, and a cours sletia mentioned in the [blank] two cascs to contain 41, the other being opened before contains 20, this find contains but 20 & a half."

I long for the comeing down of the sloope, for I am much incommoded, haveing one little rome for all of us to stirr in. Pray lett me have the Benneen cloaths per first opportunity, Cape de Verd cloths you advise there is non. Musquet, sword and bandylyars have received.

The canoe men have left of their demands, but I am verry much pestred with the Agga men aboute fenceing and thatching the Factory, they say they will be paid and demand 3o 8a for their work, they denie they ever made such promisess you writte of. [As] for comeing to Cabo Corso at Christmass they never thought of it, and often tell me I keep the money in my hands. What to do with them I know not.

They have not been so rude to take away any of the fence, but Captain Sham [= Asham] has made it his bussines to stope the trade, biding the Agga men and rest of the Cabbosheers not to come here with any corne or gold, but they tell me they will not obey his commands. He has troubled me much every day, and I perceive he is my chief desturber and could I gett rid [ms 'aid'] of him I believe might live much more quitley here. The Corrantiers have been to me also, demanding their custome as formerly paid them in a very rude manner (I am apt to think sett on by Asham). After I had told them you knew nothing of their customes, so could not allow, they told me they would either have a say or they would not goe out of the Factory till they had seen me in a canoe. They stayed here till neer 10 a clock at night, haveing many souldiers neer the Factory, much perplexeing me, I being then much troubled with the toothache, so was forceid to deliver to them one sey. I am senceable that I am to blame to exceed your order, but hope youl feavourably censure me when you know how they dealt with me, which Mr Jeffreys being then present can declaire unto you. I have put on board Mr Jefferys sloope some 160 chests corne, being as much as she can well carry in the condition she is in, which wish well to Cabo Corso. Inclosed is a receipt of the goods I brought with me.
[PS] The Braffo has not yett sent for his custome, but I suppose it will not be long ere he does. If Bonashee once clears his pawne there will be hardly any liveing here or att Annimaboe. This also incloses Mr Jeffreys receipt for the corne.

I thought I had mentioned in my last but one of their hold to their demands, but to exprese it more plainly they demand 7 peeze for the fence which incompases the Factory and 7 peeze more for thatching the house, without the corne roome, which they will not medle with unlesse well paid, but I have forwarded it as much as possible with the slaves I have and help of other men, not without expence to myself. Asham and rest are now at a generall dancing, we cannot at present advise further what they will do. The say disposed of to the Corrantiers, since you will not allow of it, shall not charge it in my accompts.

The Blacks ask very much for blue and green Welch plaines, fine and course sletias, blue long cloths, knives, paper brawles, brass pans, which goods they chiefly demand for their come, which I desire I may be speedyly supplyed with.

I cannot perceive (nor do I know) what cause I have given you to doubt the least of my endeavours for our Masters interest. The small returnes this factory has made (am sure) is not my fault, and know no reason why you should impute it to me. I wish I were in a place where the trade might make it appeare whether I minded their interest or not, though I doubt not were all things fairely accomodated here for a free trade [I] should soon make it appeare where I am. I honour the Royall Company as an other, & whilst I serve them shall be ready to my utmost to advance their interest. This month I have not taken enough to defray factory charges, so must defer my accompts till next month, though I expect no trade, being they are all preparing for the warr. being resolved (as I hear from every mouth) to fight the Attiees this month."

I have not taken money, as appears by this accompt, to defray the charge of the factory these two months, and whilst the country doe continue this intended warr with the Attees wee can expect no other then a very miserable trade. I heartly wish all differences were made up between them, for a trade [which] might answer the Royall Companys expectation."
2586,3,948,William Cooper,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,29/11/1693,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 28th instant have received, with the two quarter casks rumm of Mr Edward Searle. The Cabbosheers of this place have been sev[er]all tymes with mee, and demanded two lead barrs and one halfe barrill powder for a dashee against their goeing to fight. I have offered them one lead barr and powder suitable, but they are not saysfyed, soe this is to desire to know your pleasure whether or noe I shall give them what they demand soe unreasonably, especially considering what little profitt this factory has been to the Royall Company."
2587,3,949,William Cooper,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,05/12/1693,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 1st instant I received, concerning the Cabbosheers demands, but though I told them you would not allow it they would not lett mee bee at rest till I gave them at my owne charge.

The ballance being but 4a, I have passed to next accompt. The corne haveing according to your order bought one hundred chests, I hope in a little tyme this Factory may make better returns to the Company then hitherto it hath done. The Arcanyes hath had the better upon the Attees as yett, and have sent downe severall heads. The Braffo [ms.

I have beene treating very hard with the Cabbosheers about the price, but they will spare none under two angles per chest, though there is enough here to be had. The reason is the Mine people which come here takes off great quantities at the price they now hold, soe I desire to know your pleasure therein what I must doe, tho I beleive as their new corne opens they incline to abate."

They easily drew the bolt, broack open his chest & seazed upon his mony, which was the vallue of 7oz 7a gold. After I had received this accompt & heard the blacks affirme that their fetisch had told them that mony had been stole out of the Company factory I did not forbear urging the Cabbosheers to goe make a pallaver & with all speed to find out the roguery that had been commited in the Companys factory, telling them if they did not take care least they might be called to question for allowing such rogueries & without notice taken by them they suffering the Companys factory to sustain the least damage, upon which they unanimously made answer that they would search into the matter as much as they could, & after much debate & examination among them according to their coustome made all such as they suspected to take fetiesches & [at] last brought me into the factory one Sam Paine, a black, as guilty, & for satisfaction delivered him up unto me for a slave untill such time as he paid what he hath stole, upon which I sent him to Annimaboe to secure him for satisfaction to the said Robert Sutton for the losse of his mony.

I have taken as much care as I can to prevent the worst, and desire you'l be pleas'd to send for the rest, which is about 300 chests com, that I may refitt & repair the corn roome, which cannot be done while the corn is therein."

This morning came here Mr William Pupplett with order to measure &ca what corne have remaining in the factory, which shall be done with all expedition, and afterwards I shall take notice to purchase as much come as I can gett att 1_a per chest."
2642,3,1004,John Brown,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,10/12/1695,Fort,RAC,"According to your order I have measured all the corn att Annamaboe & Annashan, & am now effecting the same at [t]his place, which shall take care to performe with as much expedition & fidelity as possible, esteaming it my greatest happiness to please and fait[h]fully to obey such good & worthy masters as you[r] worships.

I know that it was reported and that Mr Rootsey did advice that the Dutch at Cormanteen had take in some corne at 1_a per corne [= chest], upon which we left of buying, untill had you[r] order or could bring them to take 1_a. The reason likewise that I did not charge all my come last month was because I have gott severall chests upon tallies that they owe before I have satisfyed the blacks or at lest untill such time as I know w[h]at goods they will require, soe I hope that because all my corne was not charged last month you will not suffer me to be a looser, but that I might not be found wanting to satisfy you so farr as I can that w[h]at corne I have was bought at 2a. After that I had received you[rs] I sent for all the Cabbosheers of this town and in presence of Mr Pupplett I told him [= them] that I would buy their corne if they would allowe it for 1_a, but their was not one of him that would give his concent, but told me that they expected to sell their corne as formerly at 2a per chest, and that they must first send up to the Braffoe about it before they could resolve me any furder although [ms. 'alsto'] I doubt not but when that they are better satisfyed of the agreements that you have lately made with the other Cabbosheers to have it at 1_ but that they will readily comply. I shall observe to purchase noe more come then I can preserve untill the arrivall of shipps."

take along with [them] two green perpetuanoes, and indeed I wonder much that they were content to take so little, since the broak that they had made was so large, but it seems that they had been disturbed, or else satisfyed they had layed all things so ready for their the first designes against the night following, for before they left the please [= place] they had soe stopt up the hole that they had made through the thatch that it was verry hardily [= hardly] discoverable. I have called togither all the Cabbosheers of the town and have showed them where the factory is broack and the damage that is done the Company, and have told him [= them] to make search for the rogues that have broak the Company factory, or else expect that they and [ms.

They tell me they will find out who't was that robed the factory and deliver him up to my hands, which I wish may prove true also [= although] I can but little probability [sic].

About the evening of the same day came hither Aquashee, the Captain of Abra, who gave strickt orders to all the waterside people for panyaring, but the poorer sort of people gave in their complaints, that if the Mine people were not suffered to come hither, they should loose a vent for the corne, and that they could not tell how or which way to dispose of it, without a free correspondence with the Mine, upon which the Captain of Abra made answer that what he did was by consent & order of Braffoe and country, and that therfore they must have patience a little, and consider what injuries and abuses the Mine blacks had commited upon the English, their friends, who had never given them the least occasion of offence, and for whom they had taken & received feitichees. I am credibly informed by the said Captain that the Fanteeners have allowed of and agreed upon a peace with the Cabess Terra people, and that upon very honourable terms granted to them by the Cabess Terras. The terms and way of agreement was thus: upon the 11th instant all the Cabbasheers of the Cabess country came to Great Fanteen, where they (in presence of the Fanteen Braffo & Cabbasheers) did most humbly intreat a pardon might be granted to them for all the insolenceys and injuries that they had formerly commited, & that peace and friendship might be concluded upon betwixt them for the future, wherupon the Fanteeners did consider upon what articles it was fitting for them to consent unto a peace with the Cabess Terras, which being proposed it was at last agreed upon by both sides that for the future the Cabess Terras should be solely and wholly governed by the Fanteen Braffo and Cabessys, and that as they received them in their protection they were to do nothing without their consent, and that they would not att any time to offer to make war upon those they were with peace [= at peace with], and that when called they alwaies should be ready to help them against their enemies, and lastly that they should not any more for the future presume to mollest nor hinder the Arcanys nor any other blacks from passing through their countrey about there lawfull affaires and traffique with the whitemen towards the water side. If anything else happens here that is worth taking notice of comes to my knowledge shall not faile to advise you.
PS. It is said that all the Arcaneys, who love to trade better then warr (excepting Captain Dickie and his party), are very well satisfied with the peace, and that their enemes are brought to such unexpected subjection."

I did think to have got to Agga, but it was past sunsett before I could by any possibility gett to Agga. I have this day had the Cabbosheers of Agga into the Factory, and am now settleing the Companyes affaires with all convenient speede. I have sent up by this canoe 50 chests of corne."

Here is a prospect of a good trade in a short time, if the people of the country doe not spoyle it by quarreling one with another. I will this day send my boy to the Braffoe, to hear what news he can, off which as soone as he returnes I will informe your Worships.
PS. I would desire your Worshipps to send me some paper and quills."
2663,3,1025,Charles Salmon,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,01/12/1697,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 29th November I have received, but the Braffoe took his leave of me that day, and he is fully resolved that Quamon shall never goe any more to Cormantine. The Cabbosheers of Great Cormantine, and likewise of Annamaboe, had two pallavers with the Braffoe concerning him. They proffered to be bound for his future fidelity, but to prevent the Braffoes consenting to it, I called him into my roome, and there told him the great danger of letting Quamon goe upon any security. The Braffoe liked my counsell very well, and is now fully resolved to have him up in the country with him, and there give him a severe fetish. Four of the Braffoes men have been with me this day, to whom I did communicate your Worshipps desire, they imediately went away to acquaint their master of it. Here hath been severall people to buy perpetuanoes, but will not give eleaven angles. They tell me they can buy them cheaper at Cabo Corso, and as for the damaged goods I received from Mr Sheldon, I know not how to rate them if anyone should want them, therefore desire your worshipps advice therein. Here will be Arcany traders in one week more, as the Braffoes men did this day informe me. I am now in great want for a carpenter, for the factory is so open, for want of doores and windows, that here is no security for the Royall Companys goods, the doore being off its hinges and the upper leafe of the back doore being quite gone, so that wee lye open all night. If the carpenter comes he must bring two pair of good hooks and hinges, and two small pair ditto for the present. The Braffoe bid his men tell me he would be downe againe here with the traiders, at which time an exact accompt shall be given of all proceedings."
2664,3,1026,Charles Salmon,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,14/12/1697,Fort,RAC,"This day one of the Braffoes men hath been with me. and tells me that his master hath been in the uper part of the country since Fryday last at three great towns, to settle all in peace and quietness, and to see how the towns people there stand effected to him, he being expected back today or tomorrow at furthest. Captain Aqua is this morning gone to Abra, the Braffoe sending for him before he took his journey. I have ordered Captain Equa [sic] to enquire very strictly how the palavers goes, and how the Braffoe and the up country people do agree, off which as soone as he returnes I shall give your worshipps a full accompt. The Cabbosheers here are very importunate for their customs, and in regard that Christmas is nigh, they desire that all may be send downe together, without any more trouble, which I most humbly desire may be done by first opportunity, they being every day very troublesome to me, and whereas I understand that Capt. Piles will saile on next Sunday, I humbly crave the liberty of coming to Cabo Corso Castle, to speak with him before he departs this Coast. I sent up last night a very good woman slave, by Edward Barter. I bought her from the Braffoes man, and gave them one ounce twelve angles for her."
2665,3,1027,Charles Salmon,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,08/01/1698,Fort,RAC,"According to your orders have by this Gambia slave sent seaven white pautkies, they being all that are sound, besides those six I keep for a new flagg for the factory. I would desire your worshipps to send me two quarter casks rumme for the use of the factory, and as soone as I hear how the Braffoes palaver goes with the Annamaboe Cabbosheers, who are now with him, I will give your worshipps an accompt."
2666,3,1028,Charles Salmon,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,12/01/1698,Fort,RAC,"The carpenter Bastian hath seen what the present necessities of the Factory are, and therefore I thought fitt to send him to Cabo Corso againe to chuse what boards and nayles may be convenient for the present occation. The Braffoes man hath been with me from his master, and tells me that this new Captain of Abra is turned roague, having sett some of his people to waylay the Braffoe, one of which the Braffoes men took. He [= the Captain of Abra] would have detained Aqua for Quamon, but found it could not be done to his minde. The Braffoe will turne him out as soone as he hath settled other affairs. As for goods I only want fifty iron barrs, the Blacks buying nothing else at present. When I want anything else I will give your worshipps timely notice."
2667,3,1029,Charles Salmon,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,16/01/1698,Fort,RAC,"Whereas in my former letter I wrote for fifty iron barrs, I now desire your worshipps to send 100 barrs, for nothing else goes off at present. I intended to have sent up my accompts to the last of December, but have been so ill ever since I came from Cabo Corso that I could not sitt to any business, but hope it will goe off in a short time, and this month being so farr spent, if you think fitt I will make up my accompts to the last of this instant. I have not sould many sorts of goods, but heartily wish I could. I have no news at present worth mentioning, but when I have I will informe your Worshipps of itt."
2668,3,1030,Charles Salmon,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,29/01/1698,Fort,RAC,"This is to informe your Worshipps that the Braffoe is come, and desires to have Mr Buckeridge come downe with all possible speed, and to take Quamon out of irons and to bring him downe with him."
2669,3,1031,Charles Salmon,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,09/02/1698,Fort,RAC,"By this messenger comes the ballance [of] my accompts in gold and likewise my accompt, in which if there be any error or mistake desire your worshipps that it may be sent back by the same messenger, with information where the fault is. Our Blacks here pretend they want crows and pittaxes to goe to work about riding away the rubbish of the old Castle ruings [= ruins], I doe beleive two or three of each will be suffitient to keep as many to work as wee shall at any time find willing. The boy and girle slaves complaine to me that their pay at three taccoes per month is so small that it will not buy them cankey, therefore they humbly petition your worshipps in this missive to take it into consideration about advancing their pay. The boy is able to doe as much as most ordinary slaves, and the girle may now be recconed a woman, for she does as much as any of the other three. As for trade, it is so small that I cannot take any money, they all goe on board the interlopers to buy what they want. The Blacks come to me to know if I will buy corne of them, I tell them when I have an order for itt I will doe itt. As for the corne that is here in the cornroome, itt is fitt for nothing, therefore desire your Worshipps advice what to doe with it."
2670,3,1032,Charles Salmon,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,12/02/1698,Fort,RAC,"I have sent my accompts rectified, but as for the black bafts I received no more then 113. T'is true Mr Sheldon did tell me there should be 115 and that he would send two more, but I never received them. I am sure that no traiders hath enquired for any, therefore they cannot be sould, and there was noe more then 113 when the factory was inventored, untill which time they had not been medled with or stired from the time they were brought from Annamaboe. I have spoke to severall Blacks concerning the buying of corne for damnified goods, and they have told me they will furnish me. I am now mending the topp of the corneroome, which is defective, but in five days more shall be ready to take come in, therefore I humbly desire to know what must be done with the rotten come that is here, for it is full of vermin and will spoile what good corne wee take in. The Blacks have begun to rowsay the grass from about the old fort, and trouble me very much for dramms, telling me that you promised them liquor when they were at work, therefore desire to know your will in that respect."
2671,3,1033,Charles Salmon,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,08/03/1698,Fort,RAC,"I have here sent you my February accompts, and have[ing] taken in but little corne, have omitted it in this accompt, and intend to charge it to this month of March. I am promised a great deale, but I find our great talkers is the least doers. Edward Barter is this Monday gone up to the Braffoe, intending to returne this night if possible. Our people here are very backward in opening the ground about the old fort, but noe men more forward to drink up the Companyes liquors. As for news here is none stiring worth takeing notice off, only talk of a great trade speedily, it being very little at present. The ballance of this accompt I have likewise sent, which is 15a 11t. I hope the next will prove better for the good of the Royall Company, whose interest here shall be carefully dealt with by [me].
PS. I want some thread to make the flagg. I cannot gett none here, therefore desire some."
2672,3,1034,Charles Salmon,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,27/03/1698,Fort,RAC,"I have according to your order sent the duplicates of my accompts, but as for corne, it comes in very slowly. I have taken in at this present noe more then twenty five chests, but the people tell me in a short time they will bring what I want, which cannot be done at present, they being all soe busie clearing the ground and planting their corne, that here is noe trade stiring for anything, exept some slaves, which are carryed aboard interlopers and there sould for goods, which they have at very low rates. Capt. Kempthorne informes me that he hath two great gunns to dispose off, they are about 1200 lbs each, and carry a five pound shott, which if your Worshipps will buy he desires your answer to it."
2673,3,1035,Charles Salmon,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,10/04/1698,Fort,RAC,"According to your orders have sent to the Braffoe, where I understand hath been a messenger from your Worshipps. Nevertheless I may know something more then your messenger has heard. The Dankeryes are every day skirmadging with the Arcanyes, [the latter] have given the Cabbess country one hundred bendyes to assist them, which money they have taken, but doe not at all make any show of assistance to the Arcanyes, who now grow very dubious the case will be hard with them. They have sent messengers to the Braffoe for assistance, which he hath refused to give, telling them they were enemies to the King of Aguoffoe, therefore he would not help them, and with that answer sent the messenger back. The Braffoe has likewise sent me word to gett some new goods in the factory, for the people of a place called Bramang should be with me very speedily to trade."
2674,3,1036,Charles Salmon,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,12/04/1698,Fort,RAC,"According to your orders sent a messenger yesterday to the Braffoe, which messenger returned about 10 a night, with an answer that the Braffoe would be coming from Abra at the crowing of the cock. I hourly expect him. Doe believe it would be better to send that canoe I had at Commenda for those of Abra, and here is noe five hand canoe (but at Annamaboe there is). If your Worshipps think fitt of it I desire a quarter cask of rumme may be sent in her, for I am in great want of it."
2675,3,1037,Charles Salmon,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,15/04/1698,Fort,RAC,"By this messenger comes my accompts for March with its ballance due [and] duplicates. Desireing your Worshipps that the rumme you last sent may be changed, for the canoe men have quite spoiled it, by putting so much salt water in it that it's not fitt to drink. I heard a great many gunns this morning from Cabo Corso, which puts me in mind your Worshipps have some good news. I have not sent any messenger to the Braffoe since his two men were here that went to Cabo Corso Castle, all things here being very quiett and silent at present. The interlopers are all sayled from hence this morning, exept Capt. Kempthorne, who will in a short time be ready to depart this road, he having almost his cargoe of slaves on board him."
2676,3,1038,Charles Salmon,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,18/04/1698,Fort,RAC,"Hopeing that by this time your great troubles about this makeing peace between the King of Aguoffoe and the Generall of the Mina is almost over, I come to lett your worshipps know of Mr Sheldons ill behaviour. When I came downe from Commenda Mr Jackson gave me a book of letters to deliver to Mr Sheldon, telling me that he had left it behind him when he was last at Cabo Corso about his accompts. I gave him the book of letters, since which time he has been dayly drunk, and told not only all the Commanders of the shipps here that I stole this book of letters out of his roome and carryed it to Cabo Corso Castle to show it your Worshipps on purpose to doe him a diskindness, but hath also reported it to all the Blacks, makeing me as infamous as possible he can among them, and will not allow my servants to come to the fort with any message, but he is alwayes abuseing both me and them, soe that I cannot consult anything to secure the Companyes intrest here at this juncture of affairs, there being two potent armies not farr from us, and noe man knows what the conqueror may doe. The Braffoe stands on his defence, getting what men he can together in the feild, and if he bee doubtfull wee ought to be carefull, and not always drunk and abusive when wee should be upon business of such great consequence. In the next place he withholds slaves from coming to cutt wood according to your Worshipps orders for the burning of lime, they being here but one day, and then he sent but four. Thirdly, he had the impudence to break open the letter Mr Browne sent me, concerning the Serjeant at Annamaboe, and read it, and then brought it to me himselfe, with that bare excuse he did it before he was mindfull of what he was doeing. Fourthly, he has feed the Cabbosheers of Annamaboe with abundance of liquor to stand by him, if he should be turned out of his present employ. Fifthly, he buyes all the silver he can, and hath agreed with a Black man in Annamaboe knowne by the name of Bruntue, to make silver and copper money for him, which the said Bruntue hath already done, and by relation some quantityes. This the Serjeant of Annamaboe will make oath off that Eggin told him of it, and that the said Eggin was at Bruntues house, and saw him make some, and then asked Bruntue who that bad money was for, Bruntue replyed it was for Mr Sheldon. I am sorry that I am forced to give this accompt of Mr Sheldon, for I doe assure your Worshipps it is more out of respect to the government I liveunder then it is out of any regard I have to Mr Sheldon, that I had not taken a severe revenge of him for his contumilies, for I know nott what impression it may make upon the Blacks. As for the book of letters, I hope your Worshipps and Mr Jackson [omission] that I am innocent of any such action, and hope your worshipps will doe both of us justice."
2677,3,1039,Charles Salmon,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,21/04/1698,Fort,RAC,"Last night was informed that the mobile of Fantine, misledd by some of the great men, are very backward of showing themselves in the feild, being most of them for takeing the Arcanyes part, and impeaching the Braffoe of being an assistant to the Dankeryes, and that the Dutch there are very busie with the Captain of Quoman, that Quaman is still following his former projecktions. As for the affairs of Annamaboe, they are carryed on with such rediculous actions that it is more a place of discredit to the Company then anything else, there being nothing but drunkenness and quarrelling. Last night Mr Sheldon and his Gunner fell out about a whore, the Gunner being cut very dangerously in one of his hands. The men make dayly complaints of the misery they endure, by being beaten, and Mr Newman hath informed Mr Sheldon of all I wrote to your Worshipps of him in my last to you, which I am ready to verifie to their faces on both sides. As soone as the messenger returns I sent to Cabo Corso on Monday last, I will send him to the Braffoe.

If Capt. John Luke wants more corne I can supply him with about 40 chests. I am promised tenn more tomorrow, butt it is a black mans word I must take for it, and as for gold I see none stiring unless it be silver, brass & coopper.

They tell me they are noe women to wear boysadoes, I tell them againe that though they doe nott wear itt yett they doe sell itt, being a vendable commodity of this country, and likewise the trade of either money or corne is nott soe great or soe much furthered by any of them, thatt they should be soe scrupleous of takeing their customes. All that I can say of them is this, if any money be stiring tis carryed aboard shipp, and if have any soe badd thatt the shipps will nott take itt, tis brought to the factory, and as for corne they bring just as much as they cannot help bringing when there is noe ship here, and thatt they want goods as may bee seen by my accompt. Besides an affront I lately received by one belonging to Aqua, which I will not now trouble your Worshipps with untill I see thatt justice shall be done me here.

I have been so well use'd to those & other canoemen that if I am sent uppon any such theing as I am upon now, always to give them their own time, if they have but an empty canoe that was good for any thing, and [I] do say yet that when your worships comes to be rightly enformed that you will make them pay for the corn yet, for the sea went hire [= higher] for two or three days, and they were verry uneasy, & that times when they oversett the seas were verry good, & that they would go of, so I went downe with [ms. 'whit'] them the second time, which was the same day they went up to the croom & told me that the seas was verry good, & that there was a 5 hand canoe goeing of with them, & that they would goe of, & that canoe was Quashes canoe, [the] same that came up with the corn, she was going on board the Portuguez that were goeing by us, so I went downe with them, & gave the other canoe men three taccoes to take som of the corne in & to go of before them & show them the way, so they went of together. Quashes canoe whent throw [ = through] verry well, not so much as shipt any water in her. They also followed them, & when they came just in the place where the sea broake, they all lay'd their padles downe, & lay there a considerable time, till the sea came & fill'd them full, nay if they had jumpt over board & supported the canoe of each side she had never oversett, butt they all sett [= sat] still till she turned over upon their heads, & when they came ashore [I] askt them what [omission]. The reason of my beating one of them was because he would not help to carry the corn up to the croome that was wett with the waeter. he told me he came to paddle & not to carry corne, & I could not gett them to carry corne at all. As for my desireing the people to carry corne to Annimaboe, I have done my endeavour with Quashee, but they will not comply with me by no means, & I have defered buying any more corn till I have your worships orders.

PS. These canoemen, the bearers hereof, goes of verry well, so desire to know whether I shall send any corn of in the Companys canoe. They say your worships ordered them to ley of, & me to hire 2 hand canoes to bring the corn to them, which will come to more than comeing to Cabo Corso."

I have gott a verry violent feavour upon me at this present, else should have come up at this present time. Tomorrow shall desire the doctor of Annimaboe to come & bleed me. The people here are verry slack to bring old corne in, so desire to know whither I may buy new corne at 2[a] per chests, for that is as cheap as I can gett it for, I have tryed all the ways immaginable. Not advieseing your worships before the 11 hand canoe was because I observed your worships orders of the letter dated the 18 June, so have sent the 11 hand canoe with 7 chests, haveing no more by me.

He also desires you will please to deduct one angle from the price of your perpetuanoes, for that severall people here carried away their money which have come with an intent to buy them, by reason they have thought them to dear. The trade I do not find to answer his large promises, haveing scarse taken any money this month, wherefore haveing this opportunity I thought proper to advise, and have inclosed sent you 3oz 4ta of gold in observance of your last."
2690,3,1052,Thomas Buckeridge,Tantumkweri,,Cape Coast Castle,04/09/1693,Fort,RAC,"Inclosed I have sent you my August [accompt] & ballance, being 2 ounces tenn angles and eight taccoes, per bearer, with one woman slave. On the 18th ultimo came to this croome a Bremon Captain with severall of his people, who with Quansoe and the neighbouring Blacks had been taking fetishes from thence concerning trade, and is againe returned, promising to be back in less then a month. Quanso tells me that [t]his Captain hath been sent by severall great men of that countrey, some of whose boyes came with him to palaver concerning a trade with this factory, which is now ended, and that on his second arrivall he designes to inhabitt this place for the better conveniency of traders. Both Quansoe, whose endeavours are not wanting, and also the strainger hath given me great hopes of a trade, but what will be the effects I know not, nevertheless thought it not improper to advise.

2691,3,1053,Thomas Buckeridge,Tantumkweri,,Cape Coast Castle,30/09/1693,Fort,RAC,"Not finding the trade to answer either Quansoes promises or my expectations, these are therefore to excuse the want of my accompts, haveing not taken sufficient to defray the factory expense. All the palavers I have been told are false & of noe effect. I believe Quansoes intentions of bringing a trade to this place hath been obstructed by the severall great Cabbosheers of Fanteen & Acroome, which he seems to acknowledge, & that he doth not desire a continuance of this factory since his endeavours have been frustrated, his greatest dependancyes (since Whinebah hath been setling) being upon the people mentioned in my last, who are not likely to returne, or the Companyes goods to vend. I have lately been importuned for dashees by some of these people, which without your orders I could do nothing in. Capt. Richard Bradshaw, by reason of strong currants and bad we[a]ther being severall times forced to anchor within sight of this place, was necessitated for wood and water, which rather then he should loos [= lose] ground & be driven east I procured it him, though not without trouble & charges, also two chests corne, hopeing you will allow thereof. I have by this canoe sent one woman slave on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England."
2692,3,1054,Thomas Buckeridge,Tantumkweri,,Cape Coast Castle,04/10/1693,Fort,RAC,"Haveing received yours of the 2d instant I presume to advise that Quansoe (since my last) has been urgent to have the Companyes concernes removed from hence, telling me that he has done what he can to procure a trade, but all to no purpose, wherefore he does not desire the goods should lye & damage through his means, but is willing to have them withdrawn, when I shall have your orders, so that if upon Capt. Bradshaws returne to leeward you shall cause him to anchor here [I] shall be able (without any great trouble) to put them with my self on board him. He seems much discontented at the settlement of Wynebah, to which & the great prices of goods he wholy imputes our discouragment, but what to think thereof I know not, for I do not find any one of his palavers to be true, I believe he does what he can to obstruct them, & he does not want [i.e. lack] some to do as much for him, which with the skirmishes his people and the Accrooms have of late, wherein there is one or other killd, occasions the country people not to come down, as fearing to have their money or goods paniard, and for them near the water side they are poore & therefore no traders, except with interloopers & for dashees, as there is no trade. Quansoe himself doth not seem to desire neither have his people made any certain demands, but have given me to understand that, [I] haveing been here upwards of 4 months, they did expect something as customary at the settlement of any factory, so that they leave it to your pleasure, but I do not think the encouraging them therein will be any means of trade.
PS. Quanso sayes there are great designes in hand to disturb my cousen, and that the Accrooms Cabbosheers have taken 7 bendyes from the Quamboers to assisting therein, wherefore your expedition in sending of gunns [i.e. to Winneba] may be a means to secure their footing in dispight of any opposition. Here are at Lagoe two very good 5 hand canoes to be sold, but not under 2oz 3an each.

Mr Thomas Buckeridge, haveing a little business at Quansaws Croome, sent one of the Companys slaves, which was sett upon by the Dutch and killed, which has been so much a discontent to Quansaw, that he have strove ever since to lay wait, to gett the murderer of the slave, which he have performed at last, and have in irons at his croome. The Cabbosheers at Accrom would humbly begg your Worshipps to give them the priviledge for to turnethe Dutch out from settleing at Apom, they saying [ms. 'say in'] that your Worshipps are sencible the Cabbosheers of Accrom and Quansaw took a fetish that if the Dutch should anyways molest our boys that they would be both as one. and moreover for to right us, which they [= the Dutch] have now done by killing our slave. They have not only done soe, but they have sent money to all the Cabbosheers hereabout for nott lett us settle here, but they would not take it. Then they sent that money to the Quambores, but they would not take it. Befor they send to Quamboe, Quansoe would desire your Worshipps to send him a little liquor for to give the Quamboes, and if that your Worshipps would have them for to molest the Dutch, for to send him a little liquor for to make a pallaver for to know who will assist him against the Dutch.

Quansaw came this night from Apomm, from makeing a pallaver about the slave the Dutch Copeman did sett his boy for to kill. Therefore the Fantines and Accron and Mumford people would desire your Worshipps for to send them something as encouragement, and they will be sure for to doe as your Worshipps please, for they say that if your Worshipps doe not take this opportunity your Worshipps will not have the like againe.

As for the house it's ruined, and is nothing butt a heap of loose stones, and as for the other house that I lodge in, there is neither doore nor lock in it, butt what is upon my owne chests, except a low roome where the goods lyes, and that lock and door is soe mean, had I not such an honest Cabbosheer should be mightily affraid the goods would be purloin'd.
With submission I think if you designe for to build a house for a factor here, with warehouse and other conveniencys for laying up of corne, it's best the house be raised by the water side. Now as to the pallaver wee have had with the King of Accrooms cozen, about pushing the Hollanders from Apom, [it is] as followeth, that he hath sinceerly promised to effect it, provided you will butt order downe four of the Companys slaves to Wishue, where George Devonport is, and there lett them reside purposely to lett the Blacks see you designe to settle a factory there. After that he will block them up, that they shall gett no manner of provitions into their fort, soe that he will force them to leave itt, soe that when all is accomplished he refers himselfe as well as Quanza to your usuall generossity. They both of them resent ill the Hollanders, and doe think it is [omission] to have them in this parts amongst them. For my owne part I have omited nothing that might contribute or forward the thing, as well by presents as by necessary treats [which] I have given purposely to oblidge them, I have made a shift to gett quitt already of a whole case of Barbadoes rumme. Pray be pleased to send me recruits of the same sort, by returne of this canoe, for I am like to be at a large expence yett, by gratifieing the Cabbosheers that comes downe from the country, to oblidg[e] them in order to send downe traders here. As yett there is none come. What goods I have disposed off are for corne, for Capt. Daniells ships use, who this instant arived here.

He desires you to send me two bendy's worth of long gunns called snaphanses, two chests more of sheets, two bendys worth of the inclosed stuff. Pray lett me know whither I may buy any slaves or nott, for Company's use, and what the prices of men, women, boyes and girles are.
PS. Three perpetuanoes and two says has gott much damage in the shipp, I shall never be able to dispose of them.
Capt. Daniell writes me from aboard that he will take noe more corne in then about 100 chests. I suppose you will order the rest to Cabo Corso.

Whatt corne the Blacks bring in (tho' it is very inconsiderable), [I] keep buying of itt yett, untill I have your contrary orders. I think itt would be best if you send away the sloop to fetch the fifty odd chests of old corne which lyes here, for I find itt decays much by lying longer. I am swishing the come roome floore, shall get itt done soe hard that when the come is turned itt will not gather dirt.
Knives are of noe repute here, altho' I have offered 12 of them for 1a. Have paid Quanza his ground rent from the time I have been here, to the 19th instant. Shall likewise for the time to come pay him 8a per month.
I take notice you will send me also what goods I have formerly wrote for, which is well, butt since Capt. Luke spared me 20 barrs of iron for the Companys use when here, you need nott send butt 20 more.
PS. Pay noe canoe hire if the fellows demand itt, for they came from your place this way upon their owne occasions, and offered their service to me in bringing this."
2699,3,1061,Samuel Lawson,Tantumkweri,,Cape Coast Castle,25/01/1699,Fort,RAC,"My last to you was of the 22d instant, since I have not been favoured with any from you. These are chiefly to cover the inclosed, which came to my hands about 5 a clock this morning and in complyance to his request doe send itt you by Occome, who is the expeditious man about me. I am at this instant loading of two canoes with corne for Winneba, which shall goe from hence quickly and God willing be there against noone.
PS. I have lately sent twice your boy Occame to Hurry Jaco of Accroome, who [= Occame] will sattisfie you about thatt affair with his answer. He [= Hurry Jaco] concludes always he will doe itt, but when God knowes."
2700,3,1062,Samuel Lawson,Tantumkweri,,Cape Coast Castle,26/01/1699,Fort,RAC,"I wrote to you yesterday by Occame, who brought you a letter sent to me by Mr Thomas Buckeridge of Winneba, intimateing the Blacks designes upon him there, and of his apprehensions how they would storme his fort, whereupon by his order I dispatched instantly away two canoes with corne from hence, which I hope gott safe to his hands, tho' as yett have not heard further from him, since which I have gott Arcanya traiders down hither (which occations this last). Quanza tells me they have gott a pretty considerable quantity of money alongwith them, they want brass panns of the largest sort, if you have any of them pray send me six bendys worth, [and] pewter basons of four pounds, 2 lb, 3 lb weight to the vallue of eight or tenn bendys, six chests of sheets, one bale of Welsh plaines, and twenty iron barrs. Please to advise how I must sell my pewter now. If you have nott a canoe ready thatt can bring all these goods by first then I intreat you to send me as many sheets and pewter by returne of the bearer and by thatt canoe as Occome went up in as you can, and lett the others be sent as oppertunity serves. If you should exceed the quantity of goods I writt for, itt will not be detrimentall for I am assured there is a good parsell of money comeing downe by other traders, who will have occation for the same sort of goods.
Pray if you can spare Occame lett him come downe againe. My next shall bring you my monthly accompts. I send you herewith a man and a woman slave, which please to note in conformity with me.
PS. I cannot send the woman slave which is mentioned by this conveyance, for when I came to take her away Quanza had carryed her out to rowsaw."
2701,3,1063,Samuel Lawson,Tantumkweri,,Cape Coast Castle,19/02/1699,Fort,RAC,"I have before me yours of the 24th and the 27th past, which please to pardon they were soe long unanswered, occasioned through inflameation which fell into my arme, that hindered me as well from answering your letter as sending you my accompts for the last month in course, which these now accompany, hopeing after you have found them right you will be pleased to pas[s] them in conformity with me.
The fifty barrs of iron you mention I received from Capt. Luke when he was first here, you will find in my December accompts last. I have made the factory debtor for them, as well as I have done in these accompts for 20 barrs more received of him when last here.
I received two chests of sheets, one pack of Welch plaines and fifty iron barrs by the sloope as she was agoeing downe, and as shee came back I put aboard her fifty three chests of corne for accompt of the Royall Company, which I hope came safe to your hands.
I likewise received by the nine hand canoe four chests of sheets and five casks of pewter. The two souldiers and cask of granadoes I dispatched to Winneba with all expedition.
Wee have had here not long since a discourse current that Affra Accushee was certainly kill'd by a Dancra man. I was with Quanza when the news was first brought to him, his means [= mien] demonstrated, as well as his expressions, that he was very well sattisfied with itt, for he said he deserved it long. He [= Quanza] has been very busie with the Arcany people who has beenhere some time since, butt they brought then noe money with them, for feare he should have taken it from them, upon which he gave them all assurances imaginable, that if at any time they came downe here to trade, they should not in any manner be molested in body or purse, by himselfe or any one else, the offender soe doeing should forfeit his head. Thereupon they exchanged fettishes together, and with such assureances they returned home in order to fetch downe money. He assures me there will be in a short time here a small trade, which God grant.
Come grows now scarce here, and I find by their mumbling they designe if they can to highten the price of itt. They will take now noe Companys perpetuanoes in barter for it, pretending they are to deare, and the iron trade is now all over, soe if you give me not liberty to lett them have sheets, or what goods else I have by me in lieu of it, I am affraid shall not be able to purchase the 400 chests. I have now about 140 chests at Laggoe and here. I could dispose of 20 or 30 blankets for corne if had them, soe if you please may send me them by returne of the canoe."
2702,3,1064,Samuel Lawson,Tantumkweri,,Cape Coast Castle,20/02/1699,Fort,RAC,"These are chiefly to accompany George Harvey, and to advise that I have put aboard his sloope for the use of the Royall Company, 53 chests of corne, which I wish safe in your hands. I hear noe further from Winneba, soe that I hope there is peace."
2703,3,1065,Leonard Jeffreys ,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,16/08/1693,Fort,RAC,"The Queen has sent up a canoe upon her accompt desireing you to send down the surveyer & people to worke to build the fort, for if you do not, so far [ms. 'for'] as I understand, she will goe up againe to Anganna, then there will be nothing done, for there is nothing done but she must be with them, and her people lye att her to goe up againe, perswaiding her that you will send nobody down to build, & for these [they] are such a lazy sort of people that they do not care for working, for the great palavering that the Accrongs and they had is come to nothing, for they would have a pawne from the Queen for the bringing oyster shells to the place where we intend to build. They pretended great matters at first, so long as rumm held, they brought down not above 4 or 5 boats of shells, and the Queen had such a parsell, if you do not send people to fetch them you will have none brought down. The shells lay a great way off, they w[o]uld doe nothing without the Queen doth goe along with them, she can do nothing by compulsion. The rum is spent, and if you do not send more here will [be] nothing done. We have about 5 sloops full of stones and about 9 boats of shells. I did think to come up to acquaint you about all these concerns, but the Queen told me that if I came up to Cape Coast she would goe up to Anguanna, and if she doth it will be hard getting her down again."
2704,3,1066,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,30/08/1693,Fort,RAC,"Meeting with an oppertunity of sending to Quansoes Croome, and supposing my cosen would send up a canoe about the latter end of the month, thought fitt to lett you understand of our arrivall on the 25th instant, where the people was very glad to se us and imediatly dispatched messengers up into the country to call down the people to come and worke, for by our long stay they began to be dead hearted, fearing we only kept a white man here to keep the possession, as the Queen told me when I went to give her my hand. She and the Kinge of Acroome, who came two dayes after, give large assurances of their assistances so soone as the rest of their associates come down, which they say will be in a day or two. In the mean time the Queen employes them few she hath in bringing stones, which worke she undertakes to performe herself with her Anguina people, the Acrooms for shells, and the Prince with the Winnebah people for wood, so that hope in my next to give you a faire accompt of our proceedings. In the mean time shall use my utmost diligence in uniting the people, there haveing been long feuds between the Anguinnas & Acrooms, but their greatest diferences are accomodated, fitishes taken on both sides. Here is but one palaver to be decided, and till that be done the Kinge of Acroome will not sett his people to worke, which I hope will be effected this day or tomorrow, the Queen haveing given the Kinge the reason, and staid only for the offender to make satisffaction, who is just now come down. I am forced to be present at all their talks, so that I have not had time to make such diligent enquiries as I would about canoes. Here is a man has undertaken to make me a 5 hand, 7 hand & 9 hand canoes. I could wish the people were all so forward as the Queen to promote the worke, then here would be no fear of wanting anything. Here is a fine parcell of stones ready & about 9 butts of shells, so that if they work but one day at shells we shall have enough to make a little kilne for a beginning. We shall have ocasion for more axes and some small things which shall advise at the foot of this. Captain Bradshaw sailed from hence on Sunday morning by break of day, and out of the 35 dales you were pleased to order me could find but 8, the rest being all expended as he tells me, which have already made use of for 2 dores, one for a roome for my stores, the other for the house, so that hope you will be pleased to


order me some more per first oppertunity. In a talk had with the Queen yesterday she told me that when my goods came she would order her people not to goe aborde interlopers, but that I should have all the trade. This she offered on her own accord, on my refusing to buy a slave from one of her people, telling him that where he laid out his gold he might likewise sell his slave, which he had done abord a Dutch interloper which lay in the road, & brought up the goods before my face. Yesterday in the morning came to an anchor another Dutch interloper, who fireing some guns but no canoe goeing off, he weighed againe in the afternoon. About beginning of next weeke shall send a canoe up to advise you of progress we have made, hopeing by that time to be settled to our worke. In the mean time desire you would be pleased to lett the flagg be made, the Queen haveing asked me once or twice about it. I find they are suspitious of the Kinge of Quamboes molesting us in our building, wherefore if you think it convenient may send your stick up to complement him, by which means you will heare how he is affected. Here is just now come downe one of the B[r]affoese of Fanteene, he came and gave me his hand but hath not as yett told his business, Quo saith he is only come down to throw me ackee. Pray pardon my rude writing and pass by all tautologies, being in bast.
3 or 4 long crows, some axes such as we brought down, anchors to fetch water for our lime, 2 maules, a door case 3_ foot wide & 7 high from inside for the gate, an hour glass or 2 houre ditto, a sive for the lime."
2705,3,1067,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,08/09/1693,Fort,RAC,"I wrote to you by way of Quansoes Croome, desireing my cousen to forward it. Afterwards gave you the needfull in one to Mr Platt, but was then so strained for time with the p[a]lavers we had here that must beg your pardon for the rudeness, as also the tautologies therein, hopeing Mr Platt has been so favourable to me that after the perusall [he] commited it to the flames. I have now a little more leasure to compose myself, although yesterday had a very sharp plavers with the Kinge of Acroms and some of the Anguina Cabbosheers, who sent Quo to me to demand a hundred bendys, without which they said their people should not assist us, which did not a little startle me, to se their fair promises comes to these termes, but finding the Queen was not among them [I] went imediaty to acquaint her therewith, who I found lying upon a matt and as she said indisposed (which the more readily belived because she had been cupped that day). There was with her three of the prime Cabbosheers, to whome I had no sooner made known the cause of my coming, puting them in mind of their promises both to yourselves by their mesingers as also to me in their many talks, telling them withall you had by reason they were soe pressing to you to settle here taken of the people from other places where the inhabitants would give money for your protection, but they would not give me leave to proceed in what I had to say, the Cabboshers rising from their seats said they were ashamed to hear any further, the Queen bad[e] me not molest my selfe, and that what she had promised should be performed, whereupon she sent one of the Cabbosheers which were with her to ask the Anguinas by whose instigation she had sent so many messengers to Cabo Corso to fetch the whit men, and if they were not ashamed to comence such a plaver now. They would have shuffled it off upon the Kinge of Acroome, but he denyed it as well as they, saying he never desired any thing but a cloth, to which the Queens messenger made answer it was not a time now to speake of that, but when the fort was up and gunns planted thereon, the which I ashured him he need not doubt of, so that one plaver vanished. The Kinge of Acrome rising up gave me his hand that he would speak no more of it, telling me that it was gone wi[th] the wind, to which I replyed that such gusts were able to blow down forts, whereupon all was turned into a laughter, & he promised before all the Cabbosheers that his people should goe to work on Munday to dig the shells and gett them in a readyness, and that on Tuesday I should have them brought to the fort, beging withall a flask of rum to drink with them, the which I readyly consented to, but with this proviso, that they should have no more till such time they settled to worke, which was agreed on by all so that I hope all rubbs are over, and that our worke will goe on smoothly, for if we can but settle this I reckon the hardest of our worke is compleated. The shells lying at so vast a distance from us, being upwards of three miles, makes the people shun the worke as much as they can. The Queen spares no paines to forward the worke, and is therefore gone this day to the oyster bank, with a resolution as she tells me not to return till she hath accomodated all things, which so soon as is effected and that they bring us shells [I] shall send a canoe with advice. They say it will be on Tuesday, but I have been so often deluded with fair promises that I know not how to trust them. As for wood and stone it lyes nearer to us, so that we shall not want workin[g] on the latter, of which we have a considerable quantity ready at hand and they are bringing dayly, but in a short time we must be forced to goe to the rocks to breack them, for which worke we have not one capable, wherefore the surveyor desires you will let him have Hary the Bomboy, with 5 or 6 slaves which are at Dickes Cove, which said Harry knows are fitting for that work, that we may have some ready broken by such time these are worked up which we find up and down in heaps, so not to have any delay we are resolved to run up two flankers with all expedition to secure the footing we have, and the rather by reason the Queen informes me the Quamboes are gathering men together, she hath sent out her spyes to hear news. The surveyor thinks it convenient (with your approbation), both for ornament as also for expedition, to turne the corners and make the windows and doors of brick, for the stone takes them up a great deale of time in picking them out and preparing them, wherefore if you like of it would have 50 or sixty thousand sent down with all expedition, for he begins tomorrow to lay the stones, and hopes by next Saterday night to have one flanker three foot above the foundation. He is likewise at a loss for somebody to temper his morter, being forced to put one of the white men to doe it, wherefore desire he may [have] a fellow which they call Guner sent who is at Cabo Corso. Here is a couple of black bricklayers come to offer their servis, one of them was at building of Annamaboe and they say is a good workman, it was them two built Captain Quansoes house. I have not as yet made any bargaine with them, refering them to the surveyor for his approbation and your order for their entertainment. We have lime enough for 5 or 6 dayes ready burnt, and if the Acrooms keep their words we shall be able to sett another small kilne on fire either Frid[a]y or Saterday, so that the bricklayers we have will give the more dispatch. I hope in 2 or 3 weeks time to have a flanker capable to bear guns, which makes me desire you will be pleased to order some in a readyness against that time, for it will be both an incouragment to the people here & also a terror to any one who hath a mind to oppose our building. We do not think to run it up to the top but to the first story, that it may be defencable. We shall be extreamly put to it for deal bords, haveing expended the eight Capt. Bradshaw put ashore for a dore, a table and a levell. The necessaryes I wrott for in my last desire you will send per first opportunity, as also 3 iron barrs to make cuntrey hatchets for the people to cutt wood for the burning our shells, some being more desireous of them then our axes here. Here is a smith can gett them made.
PS, 11 Sept. Be pleased to lett the smith make 4 small trowells, 4 small hammers, some small wedges to fasten our axes handles, 3 or 4 wedges for breaking stone, a flag stafe which Capt. Bradshaw may spare if he please, he haveing one on board which though he pretends is for a top mast will not serve for use and besides [he] hath a spare top mast. This was intended by the Briganteen, but she went out of the road before could send a canoe on bord, but this oppertunity presenting & haveing it writt thought it fitt to expose it to your view, humbly begging pardon for all faults. I shall send a canoe tomorrow, being the 12th instant, which should have sent sooner, but stay to se whether the Acrooms will performe their promise, tomorrow being the day limited, so shall not trouble you farther at present, but beg pardon for being so prolix.
[PPS] I have sent Quo to the oyster bank with the Queens messenger to stay there to come along with the people. I wish you could lett the stick remaine a little longer or send one of the old ones down in liew of it, by reason I dayly use it sending about, but if I know you had more urgent occasion for it and desire to have it no occasion whatever should hinder me from sending of it, which your first advice shall command."
2706,3,1068,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,12/09/1693,Fort,RAC,"Mr Bloomes canoe touching here gave me this oppertunity of sending one to you I had wrot some dayes before, being designed by the Swallow Brigantene, but prevented as gave you to understand, which might very well have stoped this canoes coming were it not for the small things wrote to you for, haveing little or no fresh advises to give you. We began our worke on Saterday, I mean to say in morter, haveing before laid a very good foundation, and have run one flancer three foot high. The two black bricklayers advised of, the surveyor hath tryed, & one whereof he finds to be a better hand for this touch [= tough?] worke then any he hath, white or black, both for worke and quick dispatch, the other he sayes is but indifferent, but we must have either both or none, for they will not worke one without another, which will be no great loss, for we can make him serviceable for one worke or other. I have not as yett made any agreement with them, staying for your orders, as also to have a little more tryall of them. We are very much in want of trowells & hammers for bricklayers, wherefore desire you would if possible send 3 of each by this canoe and give order for the makeing 3 more to be sent by the first oppertunity. What crows, axes or any of the rest of the necessaryes advised of are in a readyness or will be in a day or two, be pleased likewise to send us, for our workmen begin to come in very well, every one showing themselves forward but the Kinge of Acroome, who hath faild us againe this day, but if he doth not come tomorrow, the Queen is resolved to goe on Thursday with her own people, so that I hope the disapoyntment will not be much. We are very much putt to it for water, being forced to fetch it a good way up the river, but so soon as our people are all come in we must separate a gange [= gang] for that worke, for which would desire you would furnish us with what anchors [= ankers] you can. I shall be in want of liquor in a little time although have bought two quarter cask of rumm, the which do not thinke to charge the Company. At my coming first ashore was forced to send messengers round about the countreys to bring down the Cabbosheers, most of which carried a flask with them, and besides visitts from the great men of the adjacent countreys, who came as they pretend to settle the countrey, that traders may come down, of which they give me great hopes, and are dayly pressing me to send for some goods, these visitts are very expensive and distroy liquor, for a man must seeme a little generous to them at first, besides the dayly expense amongst the worke people. The three quarter cask[s] I brought down with me, either by long lying or ill practices of the coopers, wanted much, two of them being halfe out and the other wanted above a third, as both Capt. Jefferyes and the surveyor can satisfie, so that of them I had not two full. I should not have troubled you with this relation but to lett you understand I have been as frugall in my expenses as possible, according to the old proverb of loosing a hog for a halfepenny worth of tarr. I have sent you up the carpenter, being lame of his hand, which as soon as is recovered be pleased to returne me, being in great want of him.
PS. Pray fail not to send an hour glass, for we have dayly palavers with the white men."
2707,3,1069,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,21/09/1693,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 18th instant I received, accompanied with a parcell of necessaryes have received [sic], and should not have troubled you so suddainly but that am forced to it by the Queen, who I can with no argument diswaid from the following demands, viz a piece of saye for a cloth, with somthing for a bre[a]st cloth, with 3 or 4 strings of rangoes to come round her wa[i]st, and a string or two of corrall to hang round her neck, a good cl[o]ath for the Prince, as also for her Braffo and the Kinge of Acroome, with 10 other inferior cloths for Cabbosheers of Barricue, Mumford, Anguina, Wynnebah & Acroonne. I have done my endeavour to perswaid them to lett it alone till the fort had been up, but all is to no purpose. They promise me if that complyd with this there should be no other demands. The 10 may be ordinary ones either of pintadoes, perpetuanoes or what you think fitt, but the Prince and other two if that [you] have so much red cloth to spare and wold please to give them thereof, I know not but that it might help us very much, for they are the principall men on whom our business depends, the Accrooms for shells, it lying in their country, and although as formerly advised the Kinge of Accroome had promised to send his people for shells yett to this day he delayes, referring us from day to day, and may be plaineley perceived [waiting] for his cloth, he haveing told me so once in a palaver when [he] demanded 100 bendys. The reason the Queen is so pressing to have these things is because she must goe up to Anguina to adjust some matters between the Accims & her, which as am informed is concerning trade. She hath sent the Prince to tell the young men to come to worke, which she leaves to him and her Braffo, to be imployed as I shall direct, & hath desired me to lett Jack goe along with her, that he may hear what palavers she hath. The cloths for the Anguina Cabbosheers she takes along with her to distribute to them there, but the rest she is resolved give away before she goes, and then will appoint everyone their worke. The Barricu people are imployed at present for shells & the Mumfords will be here in a day or two, the women and children being already come, they designe to remove at once. We goe on prity shorly [= surely] with our worke. haveing one flanker within 3 foot of our first story, it being already above 8 high, wherefore desire you would send down by the briganteen 4 wall plates. 2 of 20 foot and two of 12 foot, with 6 peeces for joyces, which the surveyor would have sent of their full length, that he might fitt them here. If we stay not for those things in 10 dayes or a fortnight at farthest we may be able to mount our guns, which will be very Wellcome to the countrey people, for they are very apprehensive of some disturbance, although I cannot hear they have any fresh advises or any cause of fear from the Quamboes, the Queens nephew being lately come from thence. The two black bricklayers which formerly advised of will not worke unless you will allow them 3_an per month each, I mean the 4 weeks, wherefore pray lett me have your advise. I am forced to make use of them at present by reason 2 of the whites have every other day a feavour & ague. The Queen will not stay above 10 dayes, and doth promise to bringe down a considerable quantity of money with her. Here is 6 or 8 bendys already down, most of which for powder, which most [ms. 'must'] crave after, but the Queen will be for sundry sorts. So soon as I can gett the flancers covered shall keep a continuall fire in it to dry the walls, designing to lay the most part of my goods in it, although have made up a store roome in the thatched house I live in. There are 2 peeces of planks at the Hill, which the surveyor designed for the guard roome, they if you would be pleased to spare them would do us a great kindness in makeing a platforme for the guns.
PS. We are in great want of all materialls for scaffolding, wherefore pray afford us what assistance you can. We had but 8 deale boards at first, and never a door nor table, & for ropes we have not an inch if it were to hang ourselves. When the goods come pray send some Welch plains, for they are much inquired after. Pray send likewise a little hare [= hair] for covering the flancers. I have made an enquiry about the bell but can hear nothing of it neither by Capt. Jefferyes nor canoe men."
2708,3,1070,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,02/10/1693,Fort,RAC,"I have nothing of novelty to informe you of, expecting Captain Quo down from Quamboe in a day or 2, who I hear was very well received & hath made a good palaver. This is cheefly designed to accompany one of our white men, who is taken so dangerously ill that I know not what to do with him. He is all the carpenters we have, if it suits with your conveniency desire another in roome, although a black, it would be to the Companyes interest, for I am in hopes to suply the fort with most of the timber that we have occasion for, designing tomorrow to goe my selfe into the woods. By said Quo you shall have a better accompt. In the meane time would desire you to cast away all suspicion of the Acrooms & Quamboers joyning to cutt us off, being well certified that if any mischeef is designed it comes another way & not from the Acrooms, they haveing lived slaves so long to other nations are very desireous to have a fort built, & for what I can find will not be wanting with their assistance. We have gott us one flanker ready for them I wrote you for, & had not the raines prevented should have had another above ground. Here is above twenty bendyes of money ready in the town against goods come down, the which they would deposite in my hands, nine whereof I am forced to take, belonging to the Prince, it is most for pouder and matchlock musquets, but sheets, perpetuanoes, sayes, blanketts and others are required, but for pouder & armes had I never so much could dispose of them. The Queen her self wants a 100 matchlocks.
PS. Pray send per this canoe some bale ropes for scafolding & deales by first oppertunity with the rest of the necessaryes desired."
2709,3,1071,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,06/10/1693,Fort,RAC,"I shall not trouble you with an accompt of the Kinge of Quamboes palaver, his man accompanying this, whose anger I hope your wisdome will find an expedient to appease, or by the stickes sending to and fro gaine so much time as to gett guns upon two flankers, one whereof hath been ready for three peeces I wrott for ever since Saterday last, the other goes up with all expedition and in tenn dayes doubt not but to have it to its hight. The Anguinas, whether out of fear of Quomboers or the desire they have to have a fort, work very willingly and I believe they will do their utmost endeavors to proffit us. They bid me not fear, for if the Quamboers doth [come], they are strong enough to encounter them, by reason they are at present devided amongst themselves, which if it be true the King of Quomboe will be the easier accomodated. These people here buy all the pouder and armes they can lay their hands on. There is not a ship any where nigh them but that they send off, which I do what in me lies to hinder, but till we have force can do nothing. The Queen promises that when my goods come none shall go off. I am unwilling as yett to have any difference with them, not knowing upon what grounds we stand. If you are designed to withdraw us pray lett me have secrett notice, for I fear they will be unwilling to lett us go and may play the rogue, so that I would send the best of my things away before the Briganteen comes, if that goes forward and [you] can spare the Briganteen to let her lye here 3 or 4 weeks time, it would be for the safegard of the goods you send by her, for by that time I shall find whether their promises be reall or feigned, and whether the money they brag of will come down. I have no rum left to give them that carry stones, therefore if you go forward must send some speedily, for drames must be given to encourage the workmen. They worke with great eagerness since Quo come down, so that if you can make up the breach between Quamboe and Anguina you will have nothing to fear. The Queen presses me to send for more bricklayers, which if they continue as they begin we could employ. I have by the surveyors advise entertained those two Black bricklayers, but cannot gett them under what formerly advised, if that go forward and [you] can spare any workmen for a month or six weeks it may forward the building, for I am afraid in a short time they will have expended that provision they brough[t] with them and then will be returning to fetch more, they say they have enough for 2 or 3 months. A carpenter or two would be very necessary, but the young fellow I sent up knowes no more how to handle an ax then I do. Here is good woods about five miles off where they say there is very large trees, which so soon as have any time intend to go survey, but we must be forced to cutt them to their sizes and square [them] there, for the better bringing them down. In the mean time we shall want them which I wrote for, for the more expeditious covering our first flanker, for the rest shall do my endeavors to provide them here. The Queen was intended to have sent up a Cabbosheer, but afterwards desired to lett Jack go, because he had heard all palavers, and deferrs her going up into the country till such time he comes down againe. This news of Quamboe makes her very vigorous to forward the building. They sent to me just now to intreat you to lett her have more bricklayers, she will see they shall not want stones nor shells. I wish yould spare us 10 more slaves for fetching water, for the country people will go but once a day. We shall want those slaves from Dickies Cove, for if we go on as we have done shall quickly gett all the stones that are broaken to our worke, so that the Anguinas will have a pretence to be gone. They worke both night and day, when one Cabbosheers men leave off anothers begin. As for the bell I can hear nothing of it. Capt. Jefferyes saith he never sent any canoe thether, and neither he nor Quo knows anythinge of it so, that Mr Bloom must send some better directions.
PS. Jack is sent up by our Queen and is able to give you a perfect accompt of all transactions here, as also whether the King of Quamboes man gives the same palaver to you as he did here.
[PPS] We want 100 the larges[t] spikes that are in the store."
2710,3,1072,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,20/10/1693,Fort,RAC,"Meeting with soe convenient an opportunity thought fitt to lett you understand of our pr[oc]eedings, which altho' is not according as I could wish must trouble you with it, or being come almost to a full stop without your assistance, for the stones which Capt. Jefferyes & Quo advised you of, after haveing taken of the top, finde them to be soe small and such trash that the surveyor cannott make use of them for the outside of his work, so that we have been forced to pick up stones here and there where wee could finde them, which hath been a great hinderance to us, and wee haveing noe other remedy left but to go to the breakeing, the hardnesse of which and the few or noe hands wee have which understand the said worke makes it very tedious, wherefore to give you the more expedition desire you would hasten down those stone breakers which I formerly wrote for, as also the bricks, that wee may bee running up the Fort (I mean onely caseing it) till such tyme wee have stones broake to proceed with our curtaine walls, which I fear will take some tyme to effect by the progresse our slaves make, but indeede they are all novices, which makes mee hope when the old experienced slaves come wee shall make a better hand of it. You may assure yourselves wee will bee as saveing of the bricks as possible, and if stone bee to bee had will not use a brick. I should have given you this advise sooner but that was in hopes to have found at the bottome of the heaps of stones fitting for our worke, and also rangeing the woods found that which they call the Old Castle, where wee were advised should find vast quantitys, but after clearing of it was very much frustrated, there being nothing but a pittifull wall of about 2_ foote high and 2 thick, and this but on one side, the other being encompassed with a deep dry ditch, which you are very sensible could not afford us much stuffe. Wee have gott up two of our flankers and two of the curtaine walls almost to the first story, and the foundation layd quite round, soe that had wee had stone should have wanted the door cases, which at the foote of this shall have the dementions, that they may come down with the other necessaries, which the sooner you supply us with will bee the better for expedition. I have & will make itt my utmost endeavor to give you as little trouble as possible, and should bee glad were I able to procure all things here, but when necessity requires hope you will excuse if wee continue breaking of stones. Wee cannott bee without a smith, for this hard stone makes both crows and wedges unservisable without they are new sharpened. I hope our palaver with the King of Quamboe may be near a period, for Captain Hansico and Amo had everything granted them by the Queen which you desired, and hath carried up one of her cozens to take fetiches. Wee hope may bee satysfactory. Shee gave a very fair palaver, and told the Kings man that when the Fort was up she would bee contented with what part of the ground rent his master shold allott her, hee being her uncle, shee would put herselfe wholy into his hands, the which she desired him to acquaint him, but withall desired hee would hasten downe those supply of men which hee promised and that they might bee put into my hands. I fear they will bee a more trouble to us then assistance, by reason that in 5 or 6 day's after they come there victualls will be expended, and then if you would have them stay must find them corne. The country people grumbles very much that I have not drams to give them, in the roome whereof I am forced to give them palme wine. Wee had very bad sickness with our white men, all of them haveing had sicknesse, and I feare shall loose Nevison, hee was taken the day before yesterday with a fever, yesterday was pritty well againe, but this night is taken speechlesse. I wish you would send down some person to lett them blood, for they all linger extreamly, as also Capt Jeffryes, who is troubled with such a giddinesse in his head cannott hardly stand. Mr Bloome sent his linguister hither about the bell, and with much adoe wee found out the person that brought it up, his name is Coffee Ariboy and lives at Lagoos. Quo knows the man, but John Le Grand being present when was enquireing after it, told mee the canoe was oversett and the bell lost, which if the man come hither shall not take as a sufficient answer. I asked John why hee had not told Capt. Jeffereyes of it before, his answer was hee thought the canoe men had done itt, but I finde they neither acquainted Quo nor Capt. Jeffryes with it.
PS. A door case 3_ foot wide and 7 high from inside, as formerly advised, foure window cases two foot eight inches within square, two ditto two foot eight inches high and 1&_ foot broade. These must have iron barrs fixed in them, being for the warehouse and the rest of the ground roomes."
2711,3,1073,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,26/10/1693,Fort,RAC,"This day I had advice from Captain Hansicoe and Amo by one of their canoemen which came to mee from Barricu for cankie money that they had finished the palavera, but would not bee here till Tuesday next, which made me send away. This comes to informe you that all the people wee can make are not able to breake stone for our workmen, soe that wee stand still four dayes in a weeke. The country people are ready enough to bring them to us, but cannott bee brought to breake them. I am loath to loose soe much tyme, wherefore apply myselfe to you for a remedy, which hope that [you] will speedily afford, that I may not tire out the country peoples patience. Wee have now our 3d curtain wall up within a small matter of our first dear [= tier] of rooms, and had not these letts hindred us, should have begun our front. Wee are forced to leave gaps for our window cases, which makes our work show mighty irregular. Pray if that [you] can by any means send mee down some rumm, for the expense that I am at in palme wine almost distracts mee, as Capt. Jefferyes who is the bearer hereof can sufficiently informe you, and how to remedy it I know not, for the young men will not touch a stone till such tyme as they are sure of some thing to drink. I hope if you think it not convenient to send downe goods if [you] will supply mee with some money, for am forced to supply the white men with some money, as also the slaves, and knowes not what wages they have nor how their accompts stands, which should be glad to hear. Nevison departed this life on Fryday last, and the other two are infirme, and much want the advice of a chirurgeon. His remaines are so inconsiderable that I look upon the whole not to bee worth twenty shillings, here wee have them secured till your further order. Wee have had two of our slaves run away, but the Queen sent out after them and hath taken one and brought him downe, but for their encouragement, as also they claime a custome, [I] was forced to giv[e] them that tooke him 4a. The other shall have tomorrow. I have turned him [i.e. the one recaptured] to work amongst the rest of them, by reason hee suffered soe much this time I beleive hee hardly will adventure a second, for hee had lost himselfe in the woods, and had hee not luckily been mett with might there have beene famished. I shall give you the advices more at large by Captain Hansicoe, in the interim referr you to the bearer.

[PS] Since the writeing the aforesaid the Mumfords, whose turne it was to work, came to take their leaves, and promised to bee downe by that time wee had stone for them."
2712,3,1074,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,27/10/1693,Fort,RAC,"I here send you our two fugitives, being fearfull of them attempting the like againe, that which I had given his liberty haveing been gott lurking in the woods this day.
[PS] Pray send mee a pair or two of Negro irons, for fear of the like occasion."
2713,3,1075,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,01/11/1693,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 30th ultimo came to my hands, and the same day Captain Hansicoe and Amo, but they have brought downe a fetieche along with them to bee taken by the Great Men of these parts, and are obliged by the King of Quamboe to see it taken, wherefore I cannott dispatch the great canoe soe soon as you desire and may expect, and besides they are obliged by the aforesaid promise to the said King to tarry here till Monday next, to receive one of the Quamboe Cabbosheers who is comeing downe to throw you acke, and likewise to see that these ceremonyes are performed. Our Queen stayed here till Munday last, and then was forced to goe up, and as ill luck would have it was not gone above four houres before the arrivall of Captain Hansicoe and Amo. I have sent Jack after her to bring her downe, [or] if shee cannot come to send down those men the King of Quamboe hath nam'd to take the fetichs, but have given him order if possible to bring her downe. I expect an answer this night or tomorrow, but [the] canoemen pressing mee for their cankey money, I obliged them to goe up to you, telling them that I had nothing of the Companyes in my hands, soe that thereby had opportunity of giveing you these advices. I have given them loz already, soe that Mr Salmon may see what is behinde. Here is 15 in all, Prince and them that here are willing to take it [i.e. the fetish], and hope the rest may bee the same. You are very sensible these fetiches will not bee taken without the expence of liquor, and how to come at it I know not, for it is very unproble [= improbable] Portuguezes should come hither, when you that have guns to protect them, and where money is plenty cannot get it, besides it's very hard I must lend the Company more money for towards their building, which I hope you will take into your serious considerations, and if soe bee you cannott spare a quarter cask, let me have a case to make an end of these palavers. For the workmen I can put them of with palme wine, although I fear the expence will be greater then if had greater [sic], but they will not touch a stone or any other work without a pott of wine. The surveyor tells me the white men are resolved either by night or by day to run away and goe up to Cabo Corso except they have their money at pay day, wherefor pray lett me know what their wages are and whether they owe anything out of it. I am already considerably out of pockett, [it] lying wholy upon [my] expence, and can take my oath I have not gained one cra cra since my arrivall. My accompts you shall have up by Captain Hansico & Amo. In the meanwhile if you would bee pleas'd to send me any money downe you would oblige mee. I have not at present any advices to give you more then that what have already done
PS. All our maules, wedges &ca are much our of kelter [= kilter],"
2714,3,1076,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,06/11/1693,Fort,RAC,"This day came here the Quamboe Cabbosheers with a great train, as also the chiefe man of Accroom, but I have noe liquor to entertaine them but palme wine. Some of the Anguin[a]s are come and the rest wee hourly expect. Soe soon as they are all come wee shall proceed in takeing the fetiches, and then shall dispatch Captain Hansicoe and Amo with all speede. You may believe it is not my desire to keepe them here, it being very expensive to mee. The great canoe, launching her yesterday to fetch said Cabbosheers of Quamboe, was unluckily split upon the rocks, and without a carpenter be sent to mend her is made uncapeable of swimmeing up. I was forced to hire small canoes to goe in her roome, and shall be forced to doe the like to send them to you. Captain Ball hath bought a 7 hand one which will much help us in sending up the people. This canoe putting ashore thought fitt to give you this advice, as also to desire your acceptance of 10 Guinea hens.
PS. Here is a ship come into the road just now, the Commander advised desired [sic] mee to advise you that in six dayes hee should bee ready to depart for Holland. Hee sent his boate on purpose, and says he gave his promise to Franck that hee would give you advice."
2715,3,1077,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,16/11/1693,Fort,RAC,"Wee have at last finished our palavers and the fetishe taken, which I hope will bee satisfactory both to you and the King of Quamboe. It was not delayed through any unwillingness of the Anguinas, but that the Queen and Cabbosheers were makeing up a difference which happened in the country wherein was some blood shed. Captain Hansicoe & Amoe, who departed from hence this morning, can informe you of the whole, to whome referr. Though they were detarded some tyme it was not wholy mispent, for I sent for the chiefe Cabbosheer of Accroom, one who hath more power then the King, and made up all palavers with him, who hath promised to bee down on Munday with his people to bring shells. I shall not trouble you with any further advices, expecting the Briggantyne down dayly with those necessaries formerly wrote for, which are what wee have occasion for. I hope our building will now goe on to your content, which shall bee my utmost care to forward. The aforesaid Cabbosheers will tell you how high wee are and the wants wee are in, especially of timber worck. The Mumfords are at last come, & worke well either for shell or stone, but am forced to give them every day 8 taccoes for palm wine, which they rather chuse then two flasks rum. The white men here have their healths very ill, one of them which is the best workman haveing kept his house this ten days, and the other ever[y] now and then troubled with a fever and ague. I should have sent the former up. but that expect the Brigantine, whose chirurgeon may give them some ease. If you can spare any others in their rooms, should bee glad, for wee have never a good hand now left to work."
2716,3,1078,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,07/12/1693,Fort,RAC,"This serves chiefly to accompany the bearer, William Johnson bricklayer, who hath been almost for these two months troubled with a lazey distemper, or to speake more plainely sick of the work. It seems it is of a distemper hee used to bee troubled with both at Cabo Corso Castle as also in his apprenticeshipp, and whether his long dissembling with God Almighty hath provoked him at last to afflict him, or that it is a fitt of the old not well carried of, I know not, but am apt to beleive the latter by reason it takes him at such sett tymes. All Sundayes and dayes which wee cannot gett stone to work hee is abroade, and at his sickest tymes eats heartily and will swill palme wine till he splitts. I could insist upon many other tokens of his dissimulation, but am not willing to trouble your serious cogitations with such importunityes. The other man I have is at present lame, but will in a short tyme bee able to goe worke againe. In the mean time wee goe on with our blacks, who are more then able to keepe all our stone breakers imployed, but you must needs think wee goe on very slowly, haveing but seaven men slaves left for all manner of works, haveing had the misfortune to loose one in breakeing stone, a piece of the rock falling downe upon him. Capt. Bradshaw arrived here on Munday was a fortnight, by whom received the necessaryes you advised of, but finde the brickes to come out much short, not exceeding 7500 whole ones and 1500 or two thousand batts at most. There was one bale of blankitts very much damag'd, 28th [sic] of them being fitt for nothing, likewise one case of sayes very ill colours and damnified in the folds by long lying. The rest of the goods as much as have opened proves very well and hope will finde a markitt, but at present can sell little or nothing, they haveing layd out their moneys in guns and powder and other Dutch goods, which as yett they cannot dispose of. Since my comeing downe here hath gone of above 100 bendys, most being for armes and powder. Soe soon as you will allow mee guns shall prevent it in a great matter with disgusting the country people. Prince and one or two more Cabbosheers are willing to joyne with mee in it. I shall not trouble you with any further advice, you well knowing what our wants are. the which I hope you will afford to the utmost of your abilityes, for it is pitty to have work dayly [= dally] and the dry times wast[e] a great pace. I wish I had the happinesse of a days discourse with you, which I hope you will grant at Christmas.
PS. By the returne of the canoe bee pleased to send mee 10 or 20 iron barrs, for the country begins to build their houses aboute [the] fort and wants iron for their work.
I have spared this man 14a 6ta on accompt of his wages, which bee pleased to stopp for mee. I could not even with him, not knowing what sallary he hath. I am soe miserably afflicted with the gout that must begg your pardon for my rude writing."
2717,3,1079,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,14/01/1694,Fort,RAC,"I am sorry must trouble you with soe unexpected a palaver, but as must intreate your assistance therein am forced to itt. Prince no sooner came on shore but hee secured three Cabo Corso men under pretence of an affront received from Occubah Braffo, who hee says seized one of his people with two leopard skinns and sword. As farr as I can understand hee is a Cabo Corso man who run to him [i.e. Prince] some tyme since, I mean to Great Ata his cozen, who hee hired, and is a pawne to said Occubah Braffo. I sent for him presently after the action, and would have had him release said man, and promised him would write to you and see him have justice herein, but could by noe means bring him to an accommodation, altho I told him how ill you would resent it that hee did not make you acquainted before hee came downe. Hee sayes Captain Amo would not lett him, and told him you would not concerne yourselves with Negro palavras. Hee talked with very high at first, and nothing under 70 bendys would content him, but since hee hears I have sent to make the Queen acquainted with it, and that shee is comeing downe, hee begins to bee asham'd of himselfe, wherefore I hope that shal make it up easily, but I desire you would bee pleased to lett the man be secured with the two skinns and sword. Hee stands much upon the afront, being his sword bearer, and complaines of his usage by Hansicoe and Amo, who he sayes was against him in his palavra with said Occabah, but I believe it to bee nothing but a pretence in some manner to excuse himselfe. Ataboy, whose turne it is to come to worke, hath sent downe to mee to acquainte mee hee will bee here in 2 or 3 dayes with his people. The Mumfords I expect some time next weeke. In the meane tyme am removeing to our new towne.
PS. This should have gone by a Cabo Corso canoe, but hee went away and never called for it, since which Prince hath been with mee very submissive, and hath sent to release the Cheife of them 3, that hee may goe to Cabo Corso about the palavra."
2718,3,1080,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,23/01/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 19th instant have received, but have done nothing in the palaver, Prince being gone up under pretence of bringing downe his people to work. Jack is come this day from the Queen, who sayes shee will bee here in a daye or two with great numbers of Anguinna's, soe that by the next hope may give you an accompt of our proceedings in the work. Here are messengers from the Accrooms, Fantine and Quanso, who waite her comeing to goe fetch their masters, to make an end of takeing feiteches. I wish it were once over, for I find it will be a vast charge expence for the Company to have all them great people downe, but it is a thing can no wayes bee avoyded. The Queen would have beene here before this but that shee is makeing a cry for the Arcany Cabbosheer, who was to marry her. She hath sent to mee for my hammock, and likewise for a case of rumme, both which I have complyed with. Yesterday came hither a Quamboe Cabbosheer who calls himselfe King Bonnisherrees brother, and saith the palaver between him [= Bonnisherree] and Addo is made up, and that the Cabbosheers which was with you will bee here on Munday next, but that as yett they cannott deliver the Danes Fort, they haveing soe much goods in it, which they know not what to doe with. The canoe I told you off, they have brought downe, shee is a very good one and strong, but they ask such a price for her that I dare not medle without your advice. Their first price was 5 bendas, since which they are come to 5oz. I here send you both her length and breadth, by which you may judge shee is as tite [= tight] as a cup, and I cannott see any defect in her. They would have money, but I beleive may gett them to take halfe goods, which is all at present, the canoemen being in hast to be gone.
PS. I sent the Company stick by the man that went with Princes palaver, which I hear you have received. The Queen hath sent to mee for 10 or 12 iron barrs, and saith shee will bring downe the money with her, wherefore if any opportunity presents supply mee with a few."
2719,3,1081,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,01/03/1694,Fort,RAC,"This serves only to accompany the bearer John Braittaine [= Brittaine], who is taken very ill. I have paid him his pay here. I hope you will be able now to give me a supply of workemen & necessaries for the more speedy settleing this place. I am in great want of the garders the surveyor laid out, having brought our worke up to the first story quite round. I have not time to enlarge att present, being newly come from Acrome, where I was forced to goe to make up the differences there was between these people & them, as alsoe to provide shall [= shells], the salt pond being soe filled with water here that they are very hard to come at. I shall not troble you more at present, here being a canoe to depart tomorrow, by whom if possible shall send my accompts with what else is needfull.
PS. You must send downe canoe men to fetch the great canoe, as alsoe boards to make seats. Here are no men will undertake to paddle her [ms. 'here'] up."
2720,3,1082,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,06/03/1694,Fort,RAC,"The bearer hereof Capt. Jeffryes is able to informe you how our building goes forward, and alsoe the troble I have had since I came downe with the country people, who would not give any assistance unless they had something to drinck, neither would they give me time to send up a canoe to you, the whole country of Anguina being mett togather, as alsoe the Acroms, [I] was forced to make it up with them rather than lett them goe up into their own country, and I beleive have done it cheaper than if you had sent them cloths from thence, for with this I have both contented the Cabbosheers, as also the soldiers, both of Acrome, Anguina, [and] Wynnebah, soe that I doubt not but to have great assistance. I am sorry you have had such ill success with your bricklayers, but since it is soe we must shift with our Blacks. For Johnson, he is taken ill of his lazey distemper againe, and comes not on the scaffolds in a day or two's time, and when he is there cannot put any trust in him, for my back is no sooner turned but his tools are out of his hands, which shows the Blacks an ill example. These things very much streightens [= straitens] me for time and gives me much troble, as I hope said Capt. Jeffryes will doe to me the justice as to acquaint you, that I may have either a carefull workman down or somebody to oversee the work, otherwayes must beg your pardone if am not soe punctuall in advices as would be and as you may require. My endeavours shall not be wanting neither in forwarding the building or in promoting a trade. I have sold, as will appear by accompts, upwards of four marks of goods, most of which hath been since my comeing downe after Christmas. The Queen brought down some Achims with her, who tooke away with her upwards of five bendees, and causes [them] to be here in a little time againe with a greater summe. She hath sent a boy up to stay for them, wherefore be pleased to lett me have a supply of sayes, for I have not pieces vendable, especially now here are soe many Dutch interlopers on the Coast, as also another bale of blanketts, for although I have some quantity by me the greatest part of them are damaged & the rest bespooke by the Queen, who stayes only for the aforesaid Achims. You may likewise send, haveing soe good an opportunity, some sheets, course sletias, tallow, knives, with a few 1 lb pewter basons, and hope by next shall be able to send you some of the fruite of the country. Perpetuanoes I have enough by me, they being not much enquired after, had I had sayes should not have disposed of soe many as I have. The Queen formerly sent me down four women slaves, and told me I might employ them as I did the Companys, and if they run away it should be on her accompt. Now since her comeing down she hath taken up goods for them, but since they forward our worke in fetching water, which we fetch a great way, [I] doe not send them [i.e. to Cape Coast], The abundance of raine which we have had up in the country hath soe overflown our salt pond that shell was very deficult to come att, but as God hath shutt on[e] part he hath opened another, for haveing made up the palavers with the Acromes, am supplyed with shell from them, who bring them to Apom, where I finde canoes to fetch them, which is as cheap to the Company as fetching them by the country people, the expence of liquor being very great, it employing soe many people, and besides through their neglect we have been forced to lye idle many dayes, which more than ballances canoe hire. If you [have] any old broken great canoes be pleased to order me one for said work. The Queen was very much displeased you did not send her a mourning cloth, her husband being killed att the warrs, which I excused as well as I could, but was forced to give her a piece of sayes to pacify her. We must keep in with her, for here is nothing done without her. She keeps her people hard to worke, and is resolved not to goe up into the country till she sees the Fort capable for to lodge us in. She is very pressing to have guns, which pray if possible comply with, for it will be a great while before the Briganteen will come againe. She hath told me often she ventures her life for the Company, and you will not send her any thing to defend her. She I must needs owne doth her endeavour, therefore if you think it convenient to send her in your names a good cloth with a screwed jugge with brandy, for she drinks no rumme, now it would very much encourage her. She doth not care to see Princes screwed jugg, and was very angry with me [that] I suffered you to give it him, she says it makes him too proud, soe that what ever you send lett it be to her, and though you promised Prince and the other Cabbosheers a cloth lett it alone. He works very hard & cuts all the wood for the kilne, but the Queen & he are greatt difference about the former palaver, with an addition of one or two more hath made here, which she letts alone till she goes up. I have not further to enlarge att present.
PS. We shall want the following necessaries: haire, a sheet of lead, nailes, deale boards both for scaffolds & flooring, some bricks, the stones breaking soe irregular we are forced to turne the peers [= piers] with them. I have sent up two crows & I wedge, which be pleased to order to be mended & sent downe. Pray dispatch the canoemen immediately, for they all worke."
2721,3,1083,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,12/04/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 17th ultimo by the Briganteen have received, with the goods & necessaryes therein mentioned, and ane addition of three guns, in such a condition [they] are almost unserviceable, [they] want both smiths & carpenters work, which I am ill provided to supply them, besides there is neither shott, powder nor any thing belonging to a gun, which makes me presume the press of business diverted them out of your memory, not having any advice of them in your letter. I was in expectation by said conveyance to have received some deal boards for scaffolding, haveing informed you soe largely of my wants, but I find you are not pleased to give any encouragement to the worke, otherwise you would not have suffered me to be here soe long without a board. Pardon me that I am thus plaine in expressing myself, but it is come now to that push that I cannot avoyd it, being forced to lett the worke stand still, and only provide [blank] shells and stone against such time you can supply me. On Saturday last I had like to have spoiled two of the Companys slaves through the weakness of our scaffolds, being for the most part say case boards, with old rotten canoes, with which I have run the worke to that height, being now in the lowest place up to the first story, and all the back near six foot higher. So soon as deals come that I can cover any flankers, I shall have sufficient lodging for my white men in them, and doe intend to reserve one for my goods, being timorous of having soe great concernes under a thatch cover, for which work must desire you to supply me with some bricks. The bomboy was much to blame to reckon 5000 more than he sent, which the surveyor & all the workemen can testifie to be true, with which now I could [have] made shift for the present. If you could spare the surveyor and with him what carpenters you have to come downe & lay the beams and fix the joices, you might have them returned in a small time, and then we might carry up our worke regular, and besides would forward us very much, for in a small time wee shall worke as farr as we can goe till this be done, soe that the bricklayers must stand still and look on the carpenters. Be pleased to consider, at whatsoever time it is done, must have a carpenter or two from you, and hope it may suite with your conveniences to spare them now. Will is a very willing fellow, and when is well doth not grumble at his worke, but he must have somebody to direct him. He is now laid up with wormes, as also five or six slaves more. By the great canoe wherein went Capt. Jeffreyes went up Grande Quacou, he haveing been sick ever since I brought him downe. I had told Abraham he should goe up by the first opportunity, which made him put him in without further acquainting me, by which means I did not advise you sooner, which I hope you will excuse. If he is not in a condition to come downe I desire might have Tom in his roome, who I left behind, [he] being gone with Captain Hansicoe. His woman is here, who importunes me every day to write to you for him. I have had all the Anguina Cabbosheers downe here for these twenty days, which hath putt me to a great expence of liquor, all my rumme being expended, and what is more could not content them, their demands being soe unreasonable. They brought downe with them three quarteirs of young men of between 30 or 40 each. which worked very well for 10 dayes, but when I came to press the Cabbosheers to hasten downe the next quarteires they told me they must see what I would doe, and before any of them should come downe they expected every one a cloth, which were upwards of twenty, telling me what I had already given was too little for all Anguina. I find if we have any assistance from them it will cost more than it is worth, neither can I give any thing with safety, having had large promises when I gave the last money that noe more should be demanded, now they pretend that was only to one division, which is 3 quarteirs. When they found I would not comply with them they endeavoured what they could to persuade the Queen to goe up, but instead of prevailing with her she rise up in a passion, and told them if they had noe shame she had, and since she had sent & fetcht downe white men [she] would not leave the place till she had performed what promised, and sworne by her fathers head [she] would eate new corne & yamms here, and to show it was her intention hired the Winnebah to roasar for her, which they have done considerably, and with that left them, who imediately departed to their habitations in the country. What the event of this will be I know not. I have been with her since to know what we shall doe, she bids me let it alone to her and I shall see she will bring them downe, and in the mean time hath sent her own slaves to come with all expedition, with whom, the Barricus & Mamfords [= Mumfords] I shall make shift, having some stone left, but must desire you to send me 2 or 3 quarter casks of rumme, as also some brandy for the Queen, who drinks noe rumme. I wish it were once at an end, for every day brings a new charge with itt. The King of Acrom hath likewise plaied the rogue with me, putting a fetech upon the shell, for what reason I know not.
The Queen hath sent to know the meaning, and suspecting it is for some more dashees hath taken the cloth you gave Prince at Christmas and sent him, soe hope we shall accommodate that bussiness, and in the meane time have some by me, enough to goe to worke when you send me scaffolding. By these their unjust dealing you may perceive what troble I have with them, they not being like the rest of the Negroes, who after they have once made up a palaver stands to what they have done. In Anguina I am plagued with the Cabbosheers, in Acrom the Cabbosheers are all friends and the King only plagues me. By my next I hope may give you a better accompt of affairs here. The Queen harps much upon her cloth, and indeed I doe beleive it would not be ill given considering, how firme [var. 'farr'] she stands for the Companys interest and the great expence she is att. She claims it as a promise made her man att Christmas, as also a silver headed cane when the shipps come. The say she sayes was a custome, being for a mourning cloth, which leave to your serious considerations, assureing you there shall be nothing wanting in me to bring the expence off as easy as possible, acting for the Company as if it were my owne relations concernes. We have had both the Achims & Arcanyes, the latter are most for English goods, the other requiring powder & arms, but the Dutch interlopers lying soe constantly in the road doth much hinder me. By my accompts, which at the latter end of the month shall send, you will see what have disposed. In the meane time if any oppertunity presents lett me have a bale of Welch plaines. I shall not be more large at present, fearing I have presumed too farr upon your patience.
PS. Pray lett me have these following necessaries: nails of all sorts, some tarras, deale boards, bricks if possible. I have sent up to be mended or changed 3 crows, 3 wedges, 1 maull, 1 pick axe, 1 ades [= adze], 1 axe. Our axes are most of them very much worne, wherefore be pleased to lett us have 3 or 4 new ones."
2722,3,1084,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,26/05/1694,Fort,RAC,"Meeting with this opportunity of a canoe bound up, thought it convenient to advise I have received all things you sent both by Capt. Phillips, as alsoe the Briganteene, who the weather detained her[e] some time, the raines being soe violent and the seas running at that height noe canoe would venture off. I hope my worke hath not received much damadge, only one flanker, which I fear [I] must be forced to pull downe, the water having made a passage clear through the foundation. I have secured as well as I could the tops of the walls by thatching, which I doe not think to pull off till I see the weather settled. In the mean time goe to provide stones, wood & shell against wee can worke, of all which doubt not to have sufficient quantities, having made up the palavers with the Acroms and [they] taken the fetich of the shell. Were the weather better, I could not worke, my whitemen being both sick, and the two black bricklayers lame with wormes, with eight other slaves. The Quamboers are up in arms, and we are advised intend to come this way, the Queen hath sent up to know the certainty, whose messenger we expect daily, the raines haveing detarded him, there is soe much water in the way that for these 14 dayes nobody could pass from Anguina to this place. I hope it may [be] but only these peoples fears, however if any oppertunity presents desire you would send me downe some shott, both for the great guns as alsoe small arms, with some thr[e]ad and twine to make carthriadges. The canoe pressing to be gone, crave leave to subscribe.
PS. By this conveyance goes one of Capt. Bradshaws men, who he turned on shore for his refractorynesse. I would have had him take him on board againe, but he tells me he goes in danger of his life with him. I suppose he [= Bradshaw] hath given you his crimes at large by this conveyance, wherefore shall not trouble, only acquaint he is the same fellow made disturbance here on shore when they came with the last bricks."
2723,3,1085,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,31/05/1694,Fort,RAC,"This serves only to accompany William Johnson, bricklayer, who being soe extreemly ill & lame thought fitt to send him to see if you can afford him any assistance. Here is a canoe bound up in two or three dayes, by whom shall send my accompts with what small ballance I have, which I hope will every day augment, when it please God to open the weather and keep Dutch interlopers from hence. The Queens messenger sent to Quamboe is not yett returned. Wee keep watch every night, wherefore pray send some shott for the gunns. as alsoe twine & threed for to make carthrages. I am now very bussie in providing shell, and am forced for the encouragement of the country people to goe myself to the oyster banke, where I beleive we have gathered above fifty butts. Pardon my abruptness and boldness of stile.
[PS] Capt. Phillips sent this paper of [= about] keys with his humble service to you all, which keys he writes me word he forgott. Pray if possible spare me a little paper, being put to very hard shifts."
2724,3,1086,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,20/06/1694,Fort,RAC,"I have nothing of novelties to advise you, having no certaine accompt of the Aquamboers. The fear which these people are in of them furthers me much in providing shell & stone, of both which I hope to have a large stock, that soe soon as the weather breaks up may regaine this lost time, but wish you could lett me have a carpenter if it were but only for a month, both to direct as alsoe to assist this black fellow, who is willing to worke but hath not that forecast in him to lay the beams and contrive the staircase. For bricklayers, considering your necessities, shall not press, only desire that when the dry times come in you would lett one that is a workeman come downe for 10 dayes to looke upon the flankers, which I formerly advised you was afraid had received damage. As for Johnson whome I sent up, being lame, he may doe very well where there is other workemen, but wants as much directions as any blackman here, wherefore cannot rely on his judgement, and if I had my desire should rather have his roome than his company, he being such a quarrelsome fellow [to] both whites & blacks. By this conveyance you will receive my accompts, which I have moderated as much as in me lyes, but doubt not in two months or three to bring them lower, for which reason I have discharged one of the free bricklayers, being but one indifferent workeman and very lazy. I assure you it would be much to my satisfaction could I find out any way to lessen the Company charge, knowing very well it would redound to my creditt, which in this world is the cheif staff I rely on, but the many countrys I have to please and withall the ill principalls [= principles] of the inhabitants considered, may I hope be a sufficient reason of my non abillity. It hath and doth give me noe small trouble to keep a union amongst them, for should they fall out and the Acroms joyne with the Aquomboers, which said [i.e. Aquomboe] King hath tryed all ways to effect, the Aquomboers would attempt to beate us from hence. The Anguina & Wynnebah Cabbosheers are prepareing to go up to Acrom to take their fetich to be true to them and assist one another against all enimies. The Acromes have been here and taken theirs. They are desirous I should goe along with them, but I have putt it off and shall only send Captain Quo and one anchor of rumm. Soe soon as I can gett the carpenters worke finished shall runne up the front and two flankers and cover them with all expedition, which being effected shall not fear any of their palavers, it affording sufficient lodging for all our white men,
were we twenty, and with one or two carpenters more may be finished in two months. You may have your carpenters againe in less time, for after they have laid the first floor this black fellow with their directions I hope may be able to lay the roofe. I have been to see some trees which are to bigg to bring down whole, but would make good joices had I a two hand saw, and are not soe farr off but that may gett them downe without much trouble or charge. Soe soon as I have the saw shall sett the sawyers to worke, the weather beginning now to open. I have not a naile in the Factory upon what occasion soever, which pray supply me with by the first opportunity, of severall sorts.
The ballance, being 4oz 8a 4t, I send not up by this conveyance, it being a strange canoe, and besides am so plagued with interlopers since the Danes being at Accra, who they say brings a commission to take all interlopers of what nation soever, that I know not whether shall take one cra cra of money before pay day. They sell their sheets to the Negroes att 12 & 13 for 8 angles, and the rest of their goods much att this rate. If any opportunity offers of sending downe hither you may supply me with four bales of perpetuanoes more, they being goods they have not aboard, but I am in no hast of them, by reason have one bale by me not opened, besides loose ones.
PS I am heartily sorry to hear of Mr Platts & Mr Ronans indisposition but hope the worst is past.
Be pleased to send by the canoe Johnson went up in some shott, threed & twine.
By the aforegoing have given you an accompt of my wants, which if possible supply me with, for the bricklayers will have rune themselves out of worke before I can gett the joices laid. Since have received yours of the 13th & 17th instant, the contents of which I shall be very carefull to observe, makeing it my cheifest care to keep a fair correspondence with the blacks. Am heartily sorry for Mr Johnsons misfortune. I humbly thank you for the proffer of your assistance, but my malady is of that nature that at soe great a distance I fear can reap noe benefitt except it be in ane emetick, which I shall be obliged to you for sending. I am almost in the same condition I was in att the Hill with the dry gripes but only (thanks be to God) I retaine the use of my limbs, although but weakly. For these four nights I have not had one hours rest, and find myself rather worse than better. If I am able, by returne of this canoe shall be more large.
[PS] The Queen animates me very much, and bids me not feare the Aquomboers."
2725,3,1087,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,23/06/1694,Fort,RAC,"Since my last to you the messengers who the Queen sent to Quamboe are returned, being detained soe long [by] the waters being soe high. The news they bring is very good, her nephew comeing downe with them, who assures her the King of Quamboe hath noe designe on this place, soe hope wee shall meet with no molestation. The Cabbosheers of this place, Anguina & Acrome I doe not much fear, they being all very desirous of having a Fort here. The Ackims begin to be cloyed with powder and armes, and now run upon other goods. I sold two pieces perpetuanoes to one yesterday, who was only sent downe to see the goods, who says in six dayes time here will be a great many traders, wherefore desire you would supply me by the canoe I have att Cabo Corso one bale of perpetuanoes, for this last bale doth not prove soe well as the others I had, severall being motheaten, and I would willingly have goods to please them, being the first time of their comeing. My gripes are very much abated but have left me soe weake of my hands that I have much trouble to write, wherefore be pleased to excuse my rudeness."
2726,3,1088,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,27/07/1694,Fort,RAC,"Meeting with this canoe bound up have sent the crows &ca which want mending, desireing the smiths may goe about them immediately, that they may be in readiness against a canoe [I] intend up about the beginning of next week, by which shall send the duplicates you desire with my accompts & ballance. I have had a very long and tedious sicknesse and am not yett able to goe the length of my house without help, but God be praised my feavour is much abated.
4 crowes, 1 shovell. 1 woodaxe. 2 wedges."
2727,3,1089,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,31/07/1694,Fort,RAC,"My long indisposition hath rendered me soe weake that I am not able to answer yours by Mr Barter, neither give you the needfull, wherefore have sent up the Serjeant, who can informe you how the building goes forward, as alsoe what I want for immediate use. By him likewise you will receive my accompts and ballance, being mk3 4oz 7a 8ta. Had I been able you should have had my June accompts in their course, but the ballance would have been small. My head swims, soe that I must begg your pardon.
[PS] If you think it convenient may send downe a bale of perpetuanoes by the canoe the two slaves came in. I have sent another Negroe slave."
2728,3,1090,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,16/08/1694,Fort,RAC,"This is cheifly intended to accompany the bearer att the request of our Queen,
who sends him up to recovery with your assistance of [i.e. from] a canoeman
named Aquiessau, cozen to Doctor Griffin and now belonging to Peter, loz 4a in money and a woman slave, [which] she sent up by him to lay out for her, and either bring or send her the effects, but since he hath had the money, she never hath heard from him. She is unwilling to make fast about it, wherefore hath hired this canoe to see if she can gett it by faire meanes, which I hope you will be able to effect, that we may have noe further pallaver, and likewise she would be much oblidged. In one of yours you write me word the expences are soe very great that they cannot be allowed. I assure you I moderate them much as in me lyes, but our wood, stone & shells lye at such a distance that it employs a great many people to bring them to our worke, to all which am forced to give liquor, otherwise must be forced to doe all with our own slaves, which will be very tedious, for all that they can gett together in a month wee can work up in a fortnight or lesse. I hope my last accompts are to your content. For deducting the eight gallons per month allowed att all Forts where there is noe building, you cannot I thinck look upon it to be lavish, if I have any assistance at all from the country people, and as to the powder you object against I can safely take my oath I have expended more only in answering salutes of shipps comeing into the road. They all knew I had gunns, and [I] know not how in civillity to deny their salutes, unles I would appear some pitifull rascally fellow placed here only as overseer over the workmen. I hope you will not be soe hard with me as to make it come out of my pockett, the place affording both trouble & expence sufficient. Our Queen there is not a month goes over her head but drinks me out near two anchors of corne brandy. In my last accompts you will finde the slaves pay to come to one angle shorter than formerly, by reason of the death of a Negroe woman slave who dyed some dayes before, being one of them I bought of the Queen. She miscarried about two months before, and never was well after, I cannot hear it was occasioned by any blows, but course of nature. Since which have had a worse misfortune, one of the Gambia slaves named Chacuta, suspecting his womans honesty, after they had left work tooke a knife & stabbed himself in two places in the belly, and would have done the same to her, had he not been prevented by the rest of the slaves. I sent for Capt. Towres Doctor, who told me he lookt upon them [i.e. the wounds] to be mortal, for the undigested victualls issued out with the blood. However the Winnebah Cabbosheers undertooke the cure, but the next night after (what frenzy I know not possest him) left his house & never hath been heard of since. I had another Gambia here who was sick att that time, and soe continued till about ten dayes agoe, when he gott up & worked with the rest of the slaves, but Friday night last
he ran away, and was taken up at Quanso's croome. Soe soone as he [= Quanso] sends to me shall send him up. I beleive the occasion of his running was cheifly to gett to his consorts att Cabo Corso, haveing noebody to converse with.
Yesterday came downe some Arcany men, one of which I knew, haveing traded
with him when I lived att the Hill, he was a constant customer to Cabo Corsoe, he hath bought 20 peices perpetuanoes. He tells me they are trying to open a trade down hither, the way being stopped to Cabo Corso. He desired me to send for more perpetuanoes, and tells me in 10 dayes they will be down again. I have 27 pieces by me, but they are most of them of that bale I formerly advised you of, wherefore if any oppertunity offers may send me downe two or three bales. I have not above 8 or 9 but what I don't fear of putting off, soe that I am in noe great haste. Here is a generall complaint that the iron & tallow are too deare, they say that they can have barrs at Accra at 2a per barr, and for tallow I cannot gett them to exceed 3a_, att which price I beleive I could putt off a score. I am still soe weake am not able to goe out of my house.
PS. I have sent up two women slaves."
2729,3,1091,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,30/08/1694,Fort,RAC,This serves only to accompany 2 women slaves. In a day or two shall send my accompts & ballance.
2730,3,1092,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,03/09/1694,Fort,RAC,"I have received yours, but cannot apprehend for what reason you should tax me with putting the Company to unnecessary charges, when I can take my oath on it have been more frugall than if it had been my owne concerne. If soe be you have a minde I should build the Fort only with our owne slaves, I am reddy to obey your commands, but if you thinck convenient (for the quicker dispatch) I should have the assistance of the country people, it is past my skill to make them touch either stones or shell without liquors. The expence which the Queen putts me to. which is considerable, I doe not charge the Company, knowing the lesser the charge the more repute shall gaine with the Royall Company, whose favour & esteem hath been my endeavour to attaine ever since first came into their service, and would not now willingly loose for soe triviall a matter as what is in debate. As for the powder you mention, 'tis nothing but what was allowed Dickies Cove when in no greater posture of defence than this place. 'Tis true their gunns were mounted on their flankers, which I could have done upwards of two months ago, haveing had one flanker finished and covered with bricks, and two more on which I could have putt gunns which are covered att their first story
and were done long before the raines. If the Anguinas comes downe to bring stone according to my expectation & their promise I hope in six weeks to have the Fort fitt to lodge in and secure all the Companyes concernes, but when I have gott the walls to their full height must desire you to lett a bricklayer come downe to cover it, for the Blacks have not the agillity with them to cast the water as it should be, & Browne if he would worke is little better, but since the last pay day by no persuations [var. 'means'] can gett him to take a trouell in hand. His first demands before he heard the arrivall of the shipps was 8a the pay day, and to be paid from the time you sent him downe, but since he is come more moderatt and desires but 6a, & doth not talke of the past time. I cannot give him any great charecter but that am willing to have one whiteman about the worke, his being here will not excuse your sending downe one to cover the worke. By the bearer you will receive my accompts, which I hope will be to your content both as to the charges as alsoe about the Ardah slaves. The ballance, being mks3 0oz 15a 6ta I have likewise sent you up. Capt. Towers & another interlooper lyeing in the road hindered me much, but the Dutch row frigatt comeing among them I hope hath cleared the Coast of them. I have spoake to the Acroms about corne, they promise to bring me what I please. There is great plenty in the country, and if you have occasion for some old come you may have it, giveing me timely notice. I am makeing a come roome, which I hope to have finished in tenn days, for which desire you would send me 6 paire of hooks & hinges, small ones for windows and one larger paire for the doore.
[PS] September 5th. Yesterday I received out of the Briganteen 100 blue perpetuanoes for accompt of the Royall African Company."
2731,3,1093,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,08/09/1694,Fort,RAC,"This is att the request of Prince, & serves to accompany a five hand canoe he sends up to you for sale. I profered him six pez for her but he expects mountains. I desire whatever price you make with him you would take the goods as they are rated to the Factory, by reason he hath reported here that I overrate everything and that att Cabo Corso they are much cheaper, which occasioned many words with the Queen. I beleive the cheif end of sending her up is to try the markett. By this send you a man & woman slave."
2732,3,1094,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,17/09/1694,Fort,RAC,"I have nothing of news to advise you only I had this former part of the month a pretty good trade and hope it will continue, haveing taken upwards of six markes, and doe expect a company of Arcanas downe on Wednesday or
Thursday. They are now att the Queens croome, wherefore desire you would by the first opportunity send a supply of perpetuanoes, sheets, 1 lb & 2 lb pewter basons, with a bale or two [of] Welch plaines, and if you have any tapseiles, brawles or corrall lett me have a small quantity of each, being much enquired after here. Pray send the hooks & hinges desired in my last, as alsoe some nailes with about 3 dozen of staples for a canoe.
PS. I have sent the 2oz 10a."
2733,3,1095,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,06/10/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 24th ultimo by the Guiney Galley, Capt. William Piles, have received, accompanied with a parcell of goods, which for quantity come owt according to advice, butt suspecting one of the bailes of perpetuanoes opened it before Mr Rootsey & said Captain, wherein found but one good thereof, the rest being extreemly damaged, [we] valued them according to the best of our judgement, as will apear by the inventories in Mr Rootseys hands, who is gon to Accra. I wish you had sent me another bale of Welch plaines, for I beleeve these will be gone before Satterday night, which if any oppertunity offers be pleased to supplye me with, as alsoe some iron, for I had noe sooner lowered the said commodity but it was all taken off. If you will allow me to take cra cra money or corne for said perpetuanoes damaged, as alsoe for sayes and tallow, I doubt not but to dispose of some quantity to the Arcaneys, being sought for after by them, but [they] have noe Arcaney money to purchase them with.
By this conveyance you will received my accompts and ballance, being m12 5oz 0a 10ta, as alsoe another coppye of my August accompts which hope may be to your content, haveing endevoured to follow the methord you perscribed [= prescribed].
Wee have had very troublesome palavers hear, but as they noe way concern to the Companey business hear but the trouble they give me and expences upon the Castle, shall not trouble you with them, butt what cheifly detared the connoe with my accompts [was] as followeth. About three weeks agoe I had a hole cutt in my thacht of my house, & lost six halfe firkins of tallow, apon which I called the Winnebah Cabbosheers and Queen, demanding satisfaction. The Queen proposed to send up to Anguina for a fetche to be taken by foure boys, one for Anguina, one for Acroomes, one for Winnebah, and one for Fanteene, on which it fell the countrye to make satisfaction both for these tallow as allsoe some goates and sheep I had lost. In the meane time [she] desierd me not to write to you [ms. 'y1'] According[ly] [she] dispachted a boy, at whose returne the Winnebahs woold have had her brought [= bring] his said fetches owt into the markett place, but she desierd to make experiment thereof first herselfe privately, which weather she did or not (and found it to fall on the Anguinas, as is suspected) I know not, butt [she] would never bring it owt, tho prest [= pressed] to by the Winnebah, excuseing it that she exspected Quansoe and the Accroomes Cabbosheers hear to meet the Anguana who she had sent for down to woorke, and at there comeing it should be tried before them all, in which time I happened to have two ewes more stollen owt of the Forte where I had locked them upp, and being a raine[y] night traced the footings of them halfe way to Anguina, soe that it was the Anguinas that did it. The Winnebah, Accroomes [and] Quansoe being likewise come, whent to her and told her it lay now apon her to look owt the theives and make the white men satisfaction. Her answer was she had sent to Anguina about it, and if she could not heare of them she would goe up and let the white men returne to Cabo Corso Castle, [by] which answer you may perceive I am not likely to have satisfaction withowt the theives are found out or force be used, which latter course as it can be taken at any time shall at presant let alone, for fear of putting a stop to the woorke. Quansoe was very plaine with, her and told her it was a revenge apon the Anguinas but noe satisfaction to the white men, and as she had sent for them she ought to protect them and see noe harme came to them. They are now expecting the return of them sent in search who if bring noe news, and that she holds her resolution of goeing up, shall accomodate the business as well as I can, & dissemble my intention untell such time as I have force able to compell them to a compliance, for if she goes up through sham[e] of looseing her good name and esteem amongst the whitemen, which is her pretence, though I beleve it is the least occasion, the truth being to prevent makeing satisfaction, all concurring she ought to doe, what will not shame and revenge prompt that sex to do or act? I desier your speedy advice in the matter, and if you think fitt a more rougher course best, desier to you would sent down Captain Hansicoe immediatly to demand satisfaction in your names. If she comes away on Munday wee may gett her before the Cabbosheers parte, most of whome are against the Queen & Anguinas. Hear is and will be by Munday night most of the great men of Acroome and Anguina to meet Quansoe. I shall not trouble you further at present, if any novellitye happens shall advise.
PS, I have sent two negroe men slaves. Pray order the Bomboy to send downe the Negroes irons I sent with the former men slaves."
2734,3,1096,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,15/10/1694,Fort,RAC,"At the request of Captain Quansoe I trouble you [ms. 'yt'] with these few lines to accompanye two Negroe men whom he is desirous you would secure for him, which if theire friends doe not speedily come to redeeme them [he] will take up goods for. He helped me in the palaver I had with Anguina, which is all accomodated and satisfaction promised and likewise promoted the building, soe could not deny his request, the perticular shall give you at large in a day or two."

I shall send up my accompts and ballance on [ms. 'one'] Munday or Tuesday next, with the money wanting in my last, as alsoe a man slave, and should have done itt sooner butt that I am in a hurry, whatt with the traders and Muffords [= Mumfords] have not time to write. I am not quite owt of neather [i.e. perpetuanoes and sheets], butt am come to my last bales of perpetuanoes, which is bespooke, and hath proffers to laye down two bendyes in my hand, which he will forfitt if he doth not take them away in two or 3 dayes att furthest. You may likewise send some pintadoes, for Capt. Piles haveing sould some heare the people begin to incle after them, as alsoe a few lead barrs, with what powder you can spare. The connoes sudding [= sudden] departure and reason aforesaid will not admitt me inlarge, but in hast.
[PS] Bee pleased to send by the first opportunity the two crows and a maule I sent by my boy, as alsoe nailes.
[PPS] Gentlemen, sence the seailing of this there are traders come downe, who are ready to tere [= tear] him in peases for perpetuanoes, sheets and powder, wherefore if noe ship comes downe pray dispacth in a connoe and lett not the connoe come away empty."
2736,3,1098,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,03/11/1694,Fort,RAC,"I have recevied severall of yours, the last being accompaned with 100 iron barrs. As nothing of novelty to informe you I deferred puttin[g] the Companey to charges of cannoe hier, the mony being soe neer expired. The defferance I had with the Queen and the country of Anguina have made up, said Queen & Cheife Cabbosheers havein[g] takein itt upon theire selves, and promised in 14 dayes I should be sati[s]fied. After we had adjusted the matter I desiered they would consider of the Forte, and after some small debate they agrede the Muffords should be sent for to comindeal [= commandeer], being 4 quarters, each to be hear seven day[s], then to be released by the Anguinas. and them by the Aqua[n]soe people, and them by the Accoromes [= Accromes], which if they performe I doubt butt once round will finnish the Forte. One quarter hath bin heer and have woorked the seven dayes very well, the second came yesterday and this day fell to woorke, soe that I have and shall have a good parcell of shells and stone beforehand, sence my bricklayers are come to this disaster. Antony Brown I am forced to send up to gitt cured, and Quasso by an accidentiall fall brook his armes, soe that now I have onely the Black I hiered here and the oldman which I can say are anything of woorkemen, vaggamonions serving onely to fill in, and that with good looking after, to which make butt small redanse [= riddance] in these thick walls, whereof if possible pray supply me with two in there roomes, for I feare these country people, seeing such a quantity of shells & stones ready as there will be in a little time I shall have, will be neglectfull of there woorke, and to bring downe the Cabbosheers againe will create a new charge, which be pleased to take into consideration. This meeting of the Cabbosheeers have put me to a great expense, which I shall give you in a role [= roll] aparte before I bring it into my accompts, to see what you are pleased to allow, being unwilling to have any more dispute. They all whent away highly contented, and swore to me I should not want stone or shells to finnish the woork, which I am the more induced to beleeve by reason Quonso [= Quanso] and they Anguinas have already sent some corne heather to be in a readyness against theire people comes. Likewise I am informed that the Anguinas have allotted which quarters shall come first. If you can help me at this push I doubt not butt to have it finnished by next month a[t] least. You may withdraw some of your woorkmen if these accidents had [not?] happended. I must desierd you to send one downe to instruct these I had in laying the bricks to cover the roof, that I might not have it to do over againe. I could have had a good part of the forte ready to cover, butt I left of woorking on those thine [sic: = thick?] walls, which took soe much lime, and [there are] few stone to goe apon the front flanker, which devours more stone, to have as littell lye in f[ull] view of the Maneford [= Mumford], who are afetching stone, as possible can. The carpenter was taken sick two days sence and still keeps his house, complaineing of great paines, soe that now I am quete distitute, and where he in perfect health he is not able to keep t[r]acke with the brick[layers], besides wants derections to fite the starecase. His azds [= adze], ax and sow [= saw] is as much owt of order as himselfe, wherefore I have sent the two latter up that you may see I complaine not withowt a cause. By this convenience you will receive my accompts and ballance, being mk9: 6: 1:8. You will finde my exspence to be great, but in consideration of the woorke that have bin done I referr to Mr Rotsey and Capt. Piles to relate, and the extrordinary expence on the Cabbosheers. I hope you [ms. 'yts'] will not think amiss that the coon[try] people conteniew their assistance. I hope in a month or six weeks to have stone [&] shells enough to finnish the Fortt. Sence my first comeing downe I have never soe much beforehand, wherefore I am the more conserned to see these accidents that [have] befallen my woorkmen. I fear the carpenter will not be able to woorke in a small time, which will be a great disapointement withowt you can supply me with another in his roome. By Satterday night shall have my third flanker ready to cover.
The Queen is gone up into her one [= own] countrye. Att her departure I thought she would have quarrell with me because I would not satisffye her greedy averice. She sent to acquainte me of her jorney, and withall to know with what I would take my leave of her, whereupon I sent her a piece of perpetuanoe & 3 sheets for her cheife boys, which at the present she seemed to accept very kindly, but at night, I noe [= know] not what possesed her, [she] returned [them], saying it was to littell, which so aggravated me that I took them and locked them up, and swore she should have noething more. To afront me stripped her selfe of the cloath she wore, which was that you sent her, and sent it by one of her women, her Cheife boy refuseing to bring itt, with this message that if she had the rest of the things the English had given her [she] would returne them, but when she came into the country would send satisfaction. Judge, Gentlemen, weather this and what she told me was not provocation suffecient, that she would goe up in her countrey and lett the Engtons [= English] returne to Cabo Corso Castle, and I beleeve [I] had sent her some bruterer [sic: = more brutal?] answer had not the Town Cabbosheers, both Whinnebah and Anguinas, come and desiered me to lett all things alone tell the next day. for that she was in drink. Its seemes she had bound herselfe by an o[a]th not to drink palme wine for such time, which this day was expired. The next day [I] asked her [omission] weather she remembers what she had done to me, or that the Cabbosheers had made herselfe sensable of what affronts she had put apon me I know not, butt she sent her boy, who I sent back with this answer, that I was none of her boy[s], wherefore she sent the foresaid Cabbosheers to take me by forst [= force], with whome I whent, where after she had begged parding [= pardon] and owned her faulte she gave me t[w]o potts of wine as an acknowledgement, which I proffered to the Cabbosheers. I thought fitt to give you an accompt, not that I fear any quarrell will insue, butt that you might see what a perplexety I live in, and that if any quarrell happens you may not attribute to any rasheness of mine but some great provocation, as alsoe to incite [you] to afford me what assistance can of woorkemens, that now I have shells and stones may putt myselfe in a posture of defense. My couzen is able to informe you how fare I have gon with the Forte, and how soon that if I had butt woorkmen to make itt fitt for men to lodging [= lodge in] and defensable. I have had two or three such drunken palavers as which they have ended withowt any harme, shall desi[s]te troubleing you with them, butt I am shure its neather safe nor eais [=easy] lieving amongst people of this nature, who is [in] theire drinke more like Bachaneils [= Bacchanals] then people of sense and reason.
The way between this place and Accra & Quamboe is stopped by Accroomes and Fanteeners apon a murder committed upon a[n] Accroomes. His head and right hand they presented to Addoo, which makes beleeve the Acquamboes had a hand. They are a makeing of it up as fast as they can, the Aquambo have sent for the person to Accra that did itt. In the mean time it hinders a littell of our trade, said souldiers lyeing up and downe makes traders somewhat cautiousm, the Accroomes haveing sent very sharp message to them that if they doe not speedily make satisfaction they would assist [ms. 'assites'] the Accroomes [sic] against them [ms. apparently 'mt']. By the next shall give you a[n] accompt whow [= how] it goes, hopeing by that time that it will be accomodated. I will not suffer them [to] plunder here in the Whinnebah country, because the King of Aquamboe shall have noe pretence of a quarrell against this place, butt att the salte ponds which is about a mile from us theire have bin Aquamboe people plundered, and I beleeve if satisfacton be not speedyly made will be eaither killed or sould.
The 100 blew perpetuanoes and 300 sheets you sent by Capt. Piles have received, as alsoe the iron woorke and 1000 of nailes, butt the lead barrs 50 can hear noe newes of them, Capt. Piles telling me he noes nothing of them, therefore pray enquier of the Bomboy which way they whent, supposting they may be left behinde.
Pray supply me with caske or two of knives, 10 or 20 cheast of sheets and a baile or two of green perpetuanoes. I have a prospect this month will exceed the last in trade.
[PS] I have sent two men slaves by Capt. Piles for that you returned the other. Be pleased to give me credit for, as alsoe for a woman this cannoe carries who was runn away.
PS. I have sent up to be mended the following things, 2 iron crows, carpenters adzes and saw & wood axes, 2 maules, they being to light may make two into one, a wedge."
2737,3,1099,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,19/11/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 16 by the 11 hand cannoe, accompained with two hundred and fortie five dozen of knives att 10 per angle, seventy five green perpetuanoess att 9a each, three hundred and ninety sheets at 10a each, and 10 lead barrs [received]. As soon as an oppertunity presents shall write to Mr Bloome about them, not thinking convenient to putt the Company to charge of cannoe hire, butt I desiered the maules to be made heavier, which you have not observed, the lightness of them occations much more labour to the poor slaves, wherefore I have returned two, eaither both to be made into one or to put more iron to the other, for as they are they will doe us noe good, and stones are soe very hard to cutt. The carpenters saw came not, wherefore I desier you would supply me with one by first opportunity, William beging to come on board [ms. 'broad']. Not long sence supplyed Mr Bloome per order with some iron tooles or woorke, the particulars shall give you at the bottom, which att your leashure pray returne me. The 2 brick axes & the rest are taken in my inventory, the 2 brick axes shall have occation for im[e]deately to cover my roome, which in a day or two will be ready. If Antony Brown be in a condition to woork pray hasten him downe, for have a great desier to gitt the Companeys consernes into the [omission], to effect [which] shall want six paire of hinges for doors and as maney for windows, with lock for some of the doors and bolts for the others, and if you cannot supply me with locks lett me have some staples and hasps for said locks. I am sorry your stock of woorkemen is soe small, and your occation as great, wherefore shall desist [ms. 'desits' ] pressing any further, onely if you can with conveniensy spare me the old man the carpenter to instruct Will about the starecase and some other small things wee are a goeing about, in tenn days or a fortenight shall returne them againe.
[PS] I have sent by this cannoe two men slaves I received from our Queen just now.
6 trowells, 2 brick axes, 2 pairs line pines, 3 brick hammers."
2738,3,1100,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,27/11/1694,Fort,RAC,"Meeting with this opportunity of a cannoe bound up thought fitt to advise you that I had disposed of twelve pieces of the pintadoes you sent and expecte a man daily to take a bendyes worth, wherefore if Capt. Piles comes this way desier you would supply me with some more, as alsoe some rumm."
2739,3,1101,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,10/12/1694,Fort,RAC,"By this convenance you will receive my accompts and ballance, being mk11: 0: 0: 4t. The great ring I was forced to take of the Queen, but as she took some tallow I hope you will not returne it on [ms. 'one'] my hands. To make her change it will occations words. The 40 lead barrs which by mistake where sent to Accra, although have not as yet received them, [h]as charged my selfe, not doubting of their return ife delevered to Mr Bloome. I have nothing of novelty to informe you, and as to the building my Serjant is able to give you an accompt, as alsoe some small necessaries that I want for the plosturing [= plastering] of those roomes that got ready, which pray supply me with, that I may git my goods in to the Forte before Christmastime. Sence the makeing up of my accompts have sould above thirty pieces of perpetuanoes and allmost all my 2 lb basons, wherefore pray let me have by this cannoe one baile of blew perpetuanoes and by the first oppertunity some pewter and sheets."
2740,3,1102,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,25/02/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 13 February I received, and according to your orders therein have inventoryed the Factory of Agga, & delivered the same with the keyes into the possession by Mr Buckeridge, and at our arrivall have taken inventory of this Factory, which have taken into my possession. By Mr Buckeridge have sent my Agga accompts & ballance, which amounts to, all charges deducted, mkl0 6oz 8a 1ta.
Understanding Mr Bloome is going for England doe humbly request you will favour me with Accra, but if Mr Searle should desire it & you should designe it him, that you will grant me Commenda, in either of which that you shall please to place me, shall do my utmost for the Royall Company interest & your satisfaction."
2741,3,1103,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,04/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"This only advises that since my [ms. 'may'] last the Cabbosheers have been with me and demanded a perpetuano and 8 gallons rumm for custome at [ms. 'as'] a new Chief coming, whithout which they will not give the least assistance more towards fetching of stones & shells &ca. I have put them of with faire words till I know your orders therein. The Queene of Anguina I expect downe in 3 or 4 days, & as I understand will demand custome & ground rent, I desire to know your pleasure what I shall do about it per first opportunity. We are in want of nailes of all sorts, and bricks what you can spare."
2742,3,1104,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,18/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"I have received yours of the 14th instant. As to the Cabbosheers demands they require no more for the custome of a new chief, but they and the Queen (who is since come down) ask dashes for their generall danceings (being now at this tym), vizt two pintadoes, six sheets. & eight gallons rumm, which they say was used to be given when this place was formerly setled. The Queen likewise demands for her selfe a say and longee for a new Cheifs custome, and for the ground rent she asked Quo whither or noe it was time to demand it. who told her she could not expect any till the gunns were all mounted, and he assures me she will not till then desire it.
As soon as I received yours, I sent away Quo up to Captain Acong. the Leiutenant &ca, & the rest of the Cabbosheers of that country [i.e. Accron], who promise they will not supply the Mina people with one chest of corne, but on the contrary will panjar all that comes to Apom or thereabouts, they being encouraged thereto by the Captain Domine of Quamou, who hat[h] sent Captain Acong a verry rich cloth for that end, and Bonnishe of Annimaboe hath sent & given him a boy slave to reincourage him thereto, & to see it done is gon himselfe, who Quo left on his way thither. He and the rest desires you will send them a small dashee. I have already given them five sheets, but for their corne they say they will not bring it hither, but iff I will have it I must fetch it from thence. I have agreed with the Cabbosheers of Anguina to bring what corne they can at 1a 6ta per chest, who promises great quantityes, but as yet have brought none downe.
The mistake about the Guiney stuffs is in the letter that came downe with them to Agga, which makes mention but of three hundred. That of the man slave I found a while after I had sent up my accompts, which being past correcting I shall creditt in my next accompts.

PS. I desire you will send me accompts of the soldiers pay. We want _ dozen bolts & staples, _ dozen hasps & staples, a quire or two cartridge paper & cartridge thored [= thread], 7 linstocks, boards for to make a gate, an iron barr 4 foot 4 inches long, with staples for the same, an halbart for the Serjant.
Per bearer have sent a man slave on accompt of the Royall African Compagnie of England. I just now received advise that Captain Acong hath panyard some Mina people. Just now Quansa of Tantumquerry has sent his boy to ask for powder and shott for his people to assist the Fanteners. I crave your answer."
2743,3,1105,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,31/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 22d instant I have received, and have given the Queen & Cabbosheers their demands, but as yet have not seen the Accrom Cabbosheers, but intend in a day or two to meet them att Apom, & see if I can perswade them to bring their come to this place (for I find their will be no security at Apom), and to that end have sent my boy to invite them thither. They send word they can lett me have a good qantity, as the Anguina Cabbosheers before have done, but as yet find them verry slack, the which I presume may be by reason of their rowasawing. I have bought two five hand canoes, & have bespocke one 15 hand, 9 hand & 7 hand canoes, which am promised shall have in little tyme. I desire to know how I shall send them upp, being most of the canoe men (the rains coming on) have left this place. Pray lett the iron work & nails be sent per first opportunity.
PS. Just now Quansa of Tantumquerry arrived here, and in his way panjard a Dutch canoe with one molletto man, who he has brought hither with him on suspition of going to bribe the Aquamboers to fall on the back of the Fanteners & Acromes. He has left him with me, whom I shall detaine till I know your orders how I shall disposoe [sic] of him."
2744,3,1106,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,06/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"This serves to accompany accompt from February 15th to March ultimo 1695, with 2 men slaves bought on the Royall Companys accompt. Since I have been here have had noe trade so much to defray the whole Factory charge.
Tomorrow I expect the Accrom Cabbosheers, who have promissed to come hither to treat about their corne, and as I understand are inclined to bring it here. I yet have noe corne from Anguinna, can receive only their promises. Within day or two I expect them [= the Accron Cabbosheers] downe with their bendifoes in order to march & joyne with Taggees camp. They have sent already to me to give them some powder & shott, as Quanza also has done. I desire to know your pleasure if it shall be allowed them.
PS. Since my last, Quanza intending to send up the three canoe men which he paniard with the moletto into to [sic] the country to sell, att the canoe mens desire I bought them of him for four ounces fo[u]r angles & a halfe, who promisse in 10 days I shall be repaid. To that end have lett one of them passe. There is a canoe gone for that purpose. The rest remaine here for my security for his returne, & on payment to lett them all pass free. Quanza demands custome for a new Chief.
We are in great want of halfe a score crews for the slaves to carry shells in, some hoocks &ca for the windowes, & the iron I formerly wrote for, iron barrs or gratings for the prison, & a barr for a door for the same, 3_ foot long, & expecially nails. Our hour glass is brocke, & desire may have a two hour glass, & one half hour glass. Just after the ensealing of this Ataboy arrived, who says unless I will give 2a per chest will lett none be brought downe, soe that I perceive there will be noe lickelyhood of getting any corne here. Acroom Cabbosheers are not yet come."
2745,3,1107,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,13/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"This is to accompany Roger Pinson, who being verry sick, & noe doctor here to assist him. desired to came up to Cabo Corso & heath [= hath] hired him self a canoe. I desire you will lett me have another in his stead, & if you cou'd spare 2 or 3 more men, the other two being ill lickwise. Yours of the 10th instant I received. The Queen & Cabbosheers &ca being out of towne, have not yett spoke to them of come what you write of. but shall as soone as they returne. As yett have not come enough to load the canoe, but shall in a day or two.
PS. I have 3 men slaves on accompt of the Royall Company, which haveing conveniency of a prison shall keep them here. & what else I buy, except you order me to the contrary & fitt opportunity present of sending them upp. The slaves are in great want of crews to carry shells with. I have paid of Roger Pinson last months pay 12a 11ta, which shall pass in my next accompt."
2746,3,1108,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,15/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"This only comes to accompany one five hand canoe, aboard of which I have sent butt six chests of corne, on the Royall Companys accompt. As yett I have not corne to load the other canoe, nor men to carry it up. The Queen and Cabbosheers are not yet returned, soe as yett cannot advise farther."
2747,3,1109,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,23/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"This comes with James Badham souldier, being verry ill of a viollent feavour & dux, haveing here noe assistance of a Doctor or medicines, desired to be sent up. Pray lett me have one in the roome of him, and him I last sent, and if you can to


lett me have one or two men more. I have bought 2 slaves & one women more, & if I had long irons in keeping them here they might be a help to carry stones &ca."
2748,3,1110,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,25/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 23th instant have received, but I have not yet three chests corne to send the canoes with. Ataboy has been here, with whom (not whithout considerable expence) I made an agreement att 2a per chest to send downe what corne possibly he or others could with expedition, and went away in haste, as he pretended to dispatch it downe, but on the contrary as soone as he arrived there stoped the ways & will suffer noe corne to be brought here. The Queen is not yett come from Queens croome, soe tomorrow shall send Quo to Anguinna to know the meaning of it, and to make the palaver. The King of Accrome has also been here, who promissed to send his corne to this place, but has since sent word that he will not doe it, and I find noe possibility of secureing it at Apom, tho' there were a house there. There are so many canoes from Cabo Corso &ca for come that this day were few Blacks haveing a little corne which I could have had. They will not sell it me unless I will give them three angles per chest, so that I know not what to doe to answer your expectations.
PS. There is noe yams to be had.
Per next opportunity pray lett me have 10 chests of sheets."
2749,3,1111,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,03/05/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 25th past I received, & the three slaves returned me by Mr Rootsey, but not like as they were when I bought them (when as Mr Rootsey was pleased him self to tell me were good). I beleive the scarcity & want of corne brought them soe low, but now they begin to grow & look verry well. However I shall sent three more in roome of them, haveing already 2 more by me. Here is palaver upon palaver about corne. I cannot get it, I beleive, if you would give 2_[a] per chest. The Cabbosheers of Anguinna have had a difference & kill'd severall men, soe seeing noe lickelyhood of corne here, I went my self to Acrom and agreed with Acong &ca the Cabbosheers at 2a 3ta per chest (who expects you will give him a perpetuano), to supply me with what corne they can at Apom, from whence I must fetch it in canoes, there being noe lickelyhood of securing it, there is such a pack of rogues harbouring the place. Tomorrow shall send the other canoe & dispatch her from thence if possible, there being so many canoes there for come makes me afraid they will not performe their promisse. I have this day turned away seven or eight canoes which came hither for come & offerd 3a per chest.
Since my last the Queen arrived (who has sent to make up the palaver), whom I acquainted with what you ordered me about money being carried of to interlopers. She say[s] she will stand by me (and lickwise the Cabbosheers) if you will begin to allow her monthly ground rent from this tyme, like as is paid at Accra, and the Cabbosheers some allowance besides, so as noe canoes shall be suffer'd to goe aboard of ships with money, which I think much better then to be as now it is.
PS. In 3 or 4 days intend to send my accompts."
2750,3,1112,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,07/05/1695,Fort,RAC,"This only comes with the new five hand canoe, empty (bought for the Royall Companys accompt), for I cannot get corn to load, the Acroomes falling from their words. Pray lett me have what sheets I wrote for the first opportunity, and some large nails for the gate.
PS. T'other day a French ship took off of Tantumquerry the Dutch Briganteene & passed per this road to leaward. Prince desires to know what you will please to have for a woman slave with you (which says is his sister), and he will pay you & send a canoe for her. He tells me hee has already spoke about her, her name is Aducaraba. The carpenter has broke his chisell, desire you will send another per first opportunity."
2751,3,1113,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,16/05/1695,Fort,RAC,"This is to conduct my Aprill accompt, which should have been with you before but that have been indisposed with the flux & a violent pain in my head. I have little to add but that the Queen is urgent to know what you'l allow &ca for ground rent, which she says when it is agreed on no canoes shall be suffered to go off to interlopers. Here is a Cabbosheer not far from hence has stopped a man slave, which on examination is found to run away from Cabo Corso Castle. He demands a say & a blue perpetuano. I have offer'd him the usuall allowance, but for les[s] than his demands says he will not deliver him, so request to know your plaesure whether or no shall act further in it. I suppose he is one of the slaves which Capt. Piples [= Piles] brought upp. He says hunger made him run away. I have been often asked for sheets, & desire you to send send at leest ten or dozen chasts [= chests] per first opportunity.
PS. The Braffo of Fanteene is come into the Acrom country, & offer them money to assist him to fight the Fantenes, & has likewise sent to the Winnbeybahs & Anguinnas people to help him, & last night passed per a messenger here to Bonnishee to gett the aid of the Aquamboes. As yet I do not find the Winneybahs at all inclined, how the rest stand affected I cannot tell, but as soon as I understand shall advise, if so be you will thinck convenient I should send a canoe purposely. Large nails we want to make the gates to secure the slaves. Last night the 2 women slaves I wrote off, leaving them out to grind cankey, broak through the gate & run away"
2752,3,1114,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,25/05/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 21 instant I received, with three hundred & ninty sheets on accompt of the Royall African Company. The Queen being gone up to Anguinas to interr the corps of Ahenninia Bond, her brother, whoe is latly deceased, cannot give answer concerning what contract she may be willing to assent to [ms. 'so'] till her returne, which I expect will be in a few days, but this much I may presume to say. Tho this place may exceed Accra in expinces, yet is far short of what are yearly & such times as danceing &ca given away att Annimaboe, & I believe, by what I have seen, were the fort once finished & in good condition would make as good returns to the Company as that or perhaps some other. Winnebah people promise not to middle [= meddle] whith the Braffos pallaver, & I have sent to Anguinna to perswade them to the same, & shall also send [to] Acrom, Quansa &ca, & as I hear shall advise you. The Cabbosheer that has taken up the Royall Company slave lives this side the Devills Hill. Have sent Quo severall times to demand him, & att last has plainly told him that he sold the slave to a Quamboe man, whoe hath carried him away. The walls of the fort are all finished, so [am] raiseing the battlements & tower, & have sent the sawyers to [ms. 'so'] see if there were trees fitt for board, whoe says they will doe well but lye very far distant. The Anguinnas demand severall peas gold before they goe to work for use of the place, & when the trees are felled all the Companys slaves here will not be enough to gett them to the sau [= saw] pitt, & the Anguinnaas not will [= will not] help except some thing be allowed them. What stones we are able to breake in a month will not I am sure finish what remains to be done. The sawyers want a driss [sic: = ?] for the whipsau, & if possible to lett him have another whipsau, this being as they say not near long or big enough, & two files. Please to send the chizells & nails per first oppertunity.
PS. Pray let me have a little paper. I am forced to tare [= tear] one of my books to write this on, or otherwise shall not have wherewithall to wright my accompts. I cannott gett come except you will give 3as per cheist. The Apom people have provided 50 chests for the interloper, whoe has sent down to them & promised 3a per chest, & the blacks themselves give that rate that comes from Cabo Corsoe.
I have sent up Roger Pimsons chest. He ows nothing here."
2753,3,1115,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,07/06/1695,Fort,RAC,"This is cheifly to advise that I have sent to the Accromes, Anguinna's & Quansa's in your names to desire them not to meddle with the Braffo's palaver. Acong & the Acrome Cabbosheers promisse they will not assist him. As yet have had no answer from Quansa, nor Anguinna, but Winnebah's assure me the Anguinna's will not medle in it. Yesterday the Braffo him selfe sent to me his son & some other messengers that I would be his friend, & that I would lett nobody abuse his people if he sent any of them this way, & also to meet him half way between the croom he is now come to & this pleace, but I have told them I was sent here only to mind the Royall Company bussiness, & not to involve my selve in blacks palavers, & for meeting of him that I could not leave the factory. Quansa by all appearance is concern'd with him. I have at last agreed with the Anguinna's people for six pease to let the Royall Companys slaves work in their woods, & have set the sawyers & carpenters to work, who have cutt downe severall trees, & the slaves are now building a house to lodg[e] in. In squaring of the timber the carpenter has broak his axe, which with four crows, one maule & two wedges, being in the like condition, have sent up per this canoe to be mended, which I desire you will returne per this canoe, with the chizell I formerly sent & nails wrote for. & to send another broad axe, these I have being to small, and another whipsaw and driss, & two or three bills to lop the boughs of the trees, without all which they can make no dispatch.
PS. Just now the Braffo's son told me if I would not meet him, when the Queen is return'd he & Quansa will come hither, which shows plainly Quansa is concern'd with him. Pray lett me have some paper, else I cannot send more letters or accompts. Pray if you can let me have two good locks, one for the prison, one for the gate, & I desire you will suply me with two or three barells powder for the fort use."
2754,3,1116,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,21/06/1695,Fort,RAC,"All yours dated May the 17th, June lst 12th & 17th, have received, & shall follow your orders to get what corne I can, but your letter came to late to disapoint the English interloper, he being at Apom a weak before yours came to hand, but I have hinder'd his getting any from this place, & truly I believe there is verry little in this country, els they would bring greater quantitys hither at the price, for as yet I have not above 3 or 4 chests. Upon the receipt of yours by Atta, I sent my boy to Quanza to demand the canoemen, who [= Quanza] went with my boy to the man that panyard them, he liveing near the river of Amessa, in the country of Fanteen far from hence, & made him deliver them. Quanza told my boy it was done without his knowledge, and I know not unless I could have devined, how I could advise of the palaver when [neither] I nor the Cabbosheers, nor any els of this place heard of word of it till Atta arrived, & the panyaring the canoe men so farr of hence was not through any default in me, for want of good correspondence with my neighbours] the natives, which I beleive I do as fairly keep with them, & do endeavor it as much as any that have lived in this place before me. Atta has been with the Queen of Anguinna, who is not yet return'd, and yesterday I sent Atta & my boy to Quanzas to perswade him not to assist the Braffo, which he has promised them he will not. He had sent for the Anguinna bendifoes, who are now here, to have them assist him, but I have perswaded [them], as likwise the Winnebahs, & also Acong (who will not suffer them to pass through his country) to returne. The iron work you sent with the whipsaw & nails have received, butt the nails are much to bigg for our use. Have sent a naile by Atta to show what size we want both for the gate & to floer [= floor] the rooms with. The sawyers are at work in cutting boards, & hope shall quickly dispatch them, therfore desire may have a good supply of nails by first conveyance. I have finished another flanker (haveing no bricks) with stones, & want tarras to finish the other two. I shall endeavor when the Queen arrive, to gett the ground rentt &ca as cheap as I can, but I beleive she will not abate of what I writt, she & the Cabbosheer[s] haveing learn'd too much what is yearly & monthly allowd in Fanteen.
PS. Pray lett me have the chizell, & two files to sharpen the whips sawes. Acong has sent to me to desire you will send him a dashee for refuseing to assist the Braffo, who offer'd him six bendys. I told him I t[h]ought you did him a kindness in advyseing him to the contrary, without any dashee, but he still makes his sutte [= suit]. I sent to Apom & Acong &ca but to no purpose, for I understand the interloper will have come tho' he gives 4a per chest. I have sent 3 women slaves per returne of the great canoe comeing from Accra in lieu of the 3 slaves return'd me. Pray let me have 2 or 3 barrells powder for the fort use, what I have being most expended. I have would have sent come now what I have, but neither canoe can take it in."
2755,3,1117,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,25/06/1695,Fort,RAC,"This only advises that I have received the three hundred twenty five she[e]ts on the Royall African Companys accompt, for which shall doe my endeavour in the disposeing of them. I desire you will not fayl to supply me with the necessarys under writt per this conveyance.
PS. Just now a messenger arrived from Quanza to me to advise that he has turn'd the Braffo from his party, & that the Braffo designs for Accrom."
2756,3,1118,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,29/06/1695,Fort,RAC,"This only accompanys two chests of corne which I send by this on accompt of the Royall African Company of England. At present have not more to advise of, the Queen being not yet arrived, who as I understand is gone to meet the King of Akims, is the cause of her stay.
PS. This morning I heard from severall blaks that the Dutch Galley mett off of the Little Devills Hill two days ago a French ship, with whom she made a running fight till she came within 2 leagues of Accra."
2757,3,1119,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,13/07/1695,Fort,RAC,"This serves to conduct my May & June accompt, wherein I have bought on the Royall Companys accompt four men slaves, which with the rest formerly bought remaine here. As yett have had but little trade, being the blacks cheifely ask for perpetuanoes & powder. If there be any herba longee gold I desire may have one case of them, two or three caske of two pound pewter basons, & 5 lb if there be any, some brass basons, a case of good pintadoes, powder especially for the forts use, & if can spare any to sell, & tarras, tarr &ca, nails.
I should have sent my accompt sooner, but have delay'd them that I might advise of the contract with the Queen, with whom I have agreed to pay her five peze per month, & custome at a new Cheifs comeing and a[t] danceing as already I have paid, and at cutting her corn a phota longee or any thing else to that value & a case of liquor, and at Christmas time a say & longee & a case of spirits, & with John Le Grand (the Captain of the towne) I have agreed to pay him four angles per month, & a red cloth at Christmas & other dashes as already paid the Cabbosheers, but Prince, Ataquo & Abarraco I cannot come to an aggrement with, so Ataquoe comes up with these to know what you will please to allow them. The two latter ask 4a per month each, & I offer'd them 2a each, which I thought was verry sufficient, but Prince would not tell me how [much] he would have, but as far as I can gather he expect half as much as the Queen. I desire to know your pleasure per returne of this canoe, & instructions what they must sign to. The Queen & John Le Grand say they will take a fetish in the open market place that none shall be suffered to goe of to interlopers, & if any should gett off will seize on their goods at their returne, and the other three promise the same when you agree with them."
2758,3,1120,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,20/07/1695,Fort,RAC,"Both yours of the 13th & 18th instant have received, with 200 two pound pewter basons, 150 caddy chints, one barrell powder, 100 silck longees, & one cask tarr, but no brushes, which desire may be sent per next. I have detaind the bricklayer[s] (for which I begg your pardon), being already suply'd with a good quantity of stones & lime, & their going would be a great hindrance to the building. B[e]sides the Queen so ill resented it when she heard of it, that she said if you took away the workmen, she would returne into Anguinna, & the Cabbosheers that they would leave of their assistance, so hope you will not take it as any contempt from me in not obeying your orders. I have alsoo received the articles of agreement of Dickies Cove and Commenda, & when I have finished the same with the Queen & Cabbosheers (which shall endeavour to do as much as in me lies to the Royall Company intrest) shall returne them to you. Since my last with my accompt to you, have disposed of all the carpets I had (saveing 3 or 4 damaged ones), therfore request you will send as soon as possible 300 carpets, here being traders that stay purposely for them, & one cask knives, bras pans &ca. Powder & blue perpetuanoes are verry much wanted, which later at present must be contented withowt. I have per returne of the canoe sent 325 sheets (being as much as the canoemen say they can carry), tho' believe shall soon be in want of them, being in expectation of a verry good trade. The axle trees shall be sent up as soon as can be gott ready. If you please to send a cask shall send up lime, haveing a considerable quantity already burnt."
2759,3,1121,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,26/07/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours by the 11 hand canoe of the 13th instant have received, with three hundred woollen carpetts & seven hundred eighty six pound brass & a quarter cask tarras, but no more then one tarr brusch on accompt of the Royall African Company of England, & have per the returne of the canoe sent as much lime as he can carry. The bricklayers I have send downe to Mr Searle. If there be any nails already made desire you will send them per first opportunity, & likewise to send twenty pair of hinges for windowes & six pair of hinges for doers, with hoocks suitable, and ten pair of bolts for windows.
We have rumor here that the King of Aquamboe designes to take the fort, & destroy all the blaks of the towne. I am at present but in an ill posture to make any defence, therfore desire you will send some hand granadoes, some muskett schott & some musketts, that I may be in a condition not to be affrighted with such reports, & if you could to spare a Gunner I have now gott all the gunns I have up, but want carriges, & the carpenter being employed to square the timbers for the sawyers cannot without you'l please to lett me have another as yet make any. Adossa have sent up per this canoe, shall be in want of another in his place.
PS. When I telld Prince that you would not allow him more then 4a per month he said if you gave him not what he demanded, [he] would stop all merchants from comeing hither, & would carry them to & fro to Barracu towne, so to prevent disturbance after many words have promised he should have a cloath of scarlett broad cloth or to the value at Christmas time yearely, an iron barr att rowsawing time. When they have signed the articles shall send them up. Adossa is indepted to me 3a, which begg the favor, being he is willing, [to be] paid me at pay day."
2760,3,1122,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,24/08/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 16th instant per the 7 hand canoe I received. Being out of lyme have stayed the canoe till I could gett some burnt, per returne of which have sent as much as she can carry without casks (of which I have none). I cannot supply you with any more lime, the salt pond stopped so can come at no shells, and all the perswasions I can make cannot gett the Winnebah people's consent to breake it open, and all because they want to make salt. I shall be verry much at a loss if I can find no other way to gett some. Per this canoe have also sent two quarter cask rum, on the Royall Company accompt, and inclosed have sent the articles of agreement made with the Queen of Anguinna and Cabbosheers of Winnebah (& returned the coppy of Commenda & Dickies Cove articles). At their takeing fetechees they would have a perpetuano & half anchor of rum. Since my last have had but little trade, by reason of difference happenning betweene the Queen & Prince, which has runn so heigh that all the Anguinna's sieding with Prinse have threeatned to kill the Queen, & have stopped the ways. It has created me a
great deall of trouble in endeavouring to make it up, and yesterday I sent Abaracu, Quo & my boy to pracifye [= pacify] the Anguinnas Cabbosheers & to bring downe Ataboy to end the palaver, which hope at last will end well. I am in great want of nailes, hinges & locks [ms. 'kocks'], as have formerly writt. Another carpenter would verry much help forward our timber work."
2761,3,1123,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,30/08/1695,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys Ataquo, who is sent by Ataboy & Anguinna's Cabbosheers to request you if possible to spare them two or three barrells powder, they haveing appointed to meet the Ackims in a few days. The palaver of the Queen is not yet made up, and untill it is can expect no trade. I am daily endeavouring to bring them to a fair complyance. It is occasioned chiefly through the Queens folly, as Ataquo can advise you. Pray order if the nails & hinges be done to be sent by Attaquo's returne, being verry much in want of them, and if you please to send a kask [= cask] of knives, what I had being the greatest part disposed, the remainder being something rousty [= rusty] will not readily go of."
2762,3,1124,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,17/09/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours the 7th instant I received, with the nails & hinges therein mentioned. This comes cheifly to accompany my July & August accompts & ballance, which (all factory charges deducted) amounts to five marques two ounces gold, which by bearer you will recieve on the Royall African Company accompt. I am daily getting the Fort in a posture of defence, and if I had but carriges for the guns [ms. 'gains'] & any supply of men & amunition might not be afraid of any black enemies, which I request you will hasten, with a barrell or two of powder, granadoes, cartridge paper (if so be any can be possibly spared), and the iron work remaining, for the Ackims a few days since haveing fallen upon severall Aquamboers a goeing to trade to their part, have killed & cutt of the heads of about forty people, and taken severall, and whe have now strong reports that in revenge of it, the Aquamboers are resoluted to fall in this place, & I beleve the Winnebahs on the least approach will all runn away. Prince is come from Anguinna, and desire[s] me to write for what men you can spare. & is verry urgent with me to send to you for more powder, but I have acquainted him with what you wrote me last. The pallaver with the Queen is almost done. The woman slave that is wanting must be Captain Peters fault in not delivering her, for I delivered him three women slaves and I had no more then three returned me, which the bearer & sundry others can testifye.
PS. I desire you will by first opportunity supply me with a new flagg, this I have being quite blowne in peices and unfitt any more to be hoisted."
2763,3,1125,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,01/09/1695,Fort,RAC,"I since the sending up my accompt and ballance, overlooking my accompt, find that the three hundred fifty sheets I returned by your order July 20th past, (through haste) not then examining the same, passed them disposed for gold, so that thereby I have overpaid two marks four ounces five angles gold, which request, my accompt being passed, you will please to give me creditt for in my next accompts in part of ballance, and my selfe shall doe the same, on accompt of the Royall African Company of England.
PS. Since my last what sheets remained are all disposed, and most of the green perpetuanoes. Desire you to send three or four bales of green perpetuanoes, & a baile of red, if any left, per first opportunity."
2764,3,1126,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,25/09/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 21st instant have received with three whitemen, but as yet no more then nine blak soldiers are arrived. I shall take care to stop the debts you order before any others. The two barrells gunpowder & iron work have received. The noise of the Aquamboes comeing still continues, & severall people for fear have left the towne. I have now about twenty plank already cutt. I judge what more they are now sawing will be sufficient, so that Bastian will be a greatt help when he comes. The green perpetuanoes are all disposed save one, so desire what I wrote for in my last may be sent. & some ca[r]tridge paper, haveing not enough for one cartridge."
2765,3,1127,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,05/10/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 3d instant per Bastian & the three quarter casks rum on the Royall Companys accompt, and the two quarter cask in the roome of those I sent up, I received by the 5 hand canoe, and shall forward the carpenter in his worck with all expedition. The reason my sending up a messenger to the King of Akim country was for no other designe then meerly that he would encourage traders [t]his way, the trade of this place (as you are sensibly) depending wholly upon that country, and not for the hurting of the King of Aquamboe or any else. In my last forgott to mention of the death of one of the men slaves, which dyed the 24 of September past. Inclosed have sent four certificates, two whereof for the slave, the other for the four carpets found wanting in a baile, no.239. I also forgott to mention that in the last chest of sheets I opened I found wanting nine, there being really no more then fifty six sheets. I should be hartly glad if any of the Company ships where arrived, want of goods being a great hindrance to this trade.
PS. I have lost allmost three marks worth of goods out of the warehouse, stollen away [ms. 'alway'] and carryed all to Prince, who was the author of it. As yet I have made no stirr about it, being desirous to know your minds therein, for if I use any forcible means will I am afraid hinder the saweyers work and put a stop to traders. The man that took the goods to deliver Prince, being his Chief man, was ketched in the action by one of the slaves, who since that has not been seen


here. Bastian wants by first opportunity 12 iron bolts eighteen inches long, 12 ditto twelve inches long, 12 ditto nine inches long, 8 ditto foureteen inches long. We want also staples for the windows to fasten the bolts, with 24 trucks [ms. 'turcks'] for the gunns."
2766,3,1128,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,18/10/1695,Fort,RAC,"This conveyance presenting is only to desire you to hasten the iron barrs &a last writt for, being the carriages are almost all done, & likewise some musquets, swords & bandilears for the souldiers."
2767,3,1129,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,08/11/1695,Fort,RAC,"This is only to desire, that you will send up per returne of this conveyance three dozen lins pins [= linchpins] for carriage trucks, & three or [ms. 'our'] four thousand nailes of the sizes inclosed, being to flour the roomes. I desire you will not fayle, being Bastian stayes & cannot goe forward without them. Here is Atabo and all the Cabbosheers of Anguinna, Quansa & his people, & Lagues, the later carry stones, & Accroomes to make up the difference between the Queen & Anguinna's, & also to make the palaver about what I have lost, & likewise other differences, butt as yett cannot give accompt of the issue of anything. They are all continually with me, so that as yet I can hardly attend any other bussiness, which will delay my accompts."
2768,3,1130,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,18/11/1695,Fort,RAC,"This comes purposely to acquaint you that one Mr Huymme, a Dutchman, is come hither for refuge, haveing fled from Axim, whereof he was chief, on what accompts I certainly know not. He desire admittance to stay here till he meets with an opportunity to gett of the Coast. I have give him entertainment till I know your orders whether or no may longer protect him, which request you will advise me. The Cabbosheers that are mett here sent to the king of Quamboe, where messengers are returned with one from the king, so hope quickly shall make a reight understanding betwixt Quamboe and here. Per bearer have returned the whipsaw, being broak, and desire you will send another in the roome, else cannot goe forward in sawing the boards, axle trees or any thing else. What axle trees we sawed before have used in the carriage[s], of which we have not yett enough, which when done shall returne Bastian and endeavor to supply Mr Searle."
2769,3,1131,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,19/11/1695,Fort,RAC,"This day since the letter that accompanys this was writt the Cabbosheers of Anguinna have opened to me an unexpected palaver after their difference was made up with the Queen, which was ended principaly by my means, that they have a bendy per month paid to the Queen, of which they have made her promise they shall mont[h]ly have one half part, and if you will not allow it they say noe trade or mony shall come here, but if you will allow the same they promise that they will unanimously take a fatish that no mony shall be carryed aboard. The Queen hath openly confessed to them that she hath already made an agreement for five peez per month &a, but she is afraid of contradicting them, for fear of [ms. 'or'] any further palaver that may prove worse. I think there cannot be worse rogues then the[y] are upon the coast. They have promised I shall have satisfaction for what I have lost, which is butt a poor security, but must at present rest content. I desire to know you[r] orders about it, and if you thinck fitt to grant their demands to returne the articles already made, otherwise to send downe a Cabbosheer that may end that palaver, for the Cabbosheers say I put the rest of the money in my pocket."
2770,3,1132,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,30/11/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 23 instant I received, and according to your order have agreed with the Anguinna Cabbosheers to pay one bendy per month ground rent from the time the Queene first signed the articles. I have paid them four bendys eight angles in hand for the time past to the time of their signing and takeing fetiches to the articles, vizt 25 instant, which they would not be content without a[t] first demanding from the time I first came here, which was long ere I could beat them of from. For the future they will have it [ms. 'to'] paid to the Queene, who is to give them one halfe. They would not take the fetiches without I gave them an ounce and four gallons rumm, being they said their lives depended on it if they broak the fetich, which they published by their Chitchee in the market place that they will punish all offenders. They likewise would not take the fetishee without I paid them 12 angles more for the sawyers workeing in their woods, six peize they said was not enough for all Anguinna, soe was forced to comply with [ms. 'whit'] that as well as the rest off their innreasonable demands.
The Cabbosheers both of Anguinna and this place all assure me there is a faire correspondance between them and Aquamboe, and the messengers from Aquamboe have told me the same, who are now along with Quansa att Tamtumquerry, soe shall have noe more allarums from thence. The Accroomes are the only people now that are likely to breed disturbance. The fetiches have been newly taken that they should not trouble this place. Two of the slaves I bought being makeing of swish, through the bomboys carelessness, who whent away and left them to themselves, they broak of their irons and run away, whom since have heard are in the Accrom country, who [= the Accroms] will in noe wise lett me have them, tho' have offerd 10a for each. The Dutchman went from hence on board a interloper before I received yours, haveing perswaded him thereto, seeing he hath a great deall of money with him, which he would often shew to the blacks, I told him I did believe you could not protect any under his circumstances, which made him hasten away. This comes with Bastian, whome request you will lett come againe in a little time, who must forward the saweyer and carpenter work both as he had already done, they being soe faine of haveing none to overlook them, they will take their leisure time if they have none to overlook them, they will not gett boards enough for 7 or 8 months for the fort, which Bastian sayes he would gett enough for 3 or 4 weakes. We are in want of lace pins and nails, & some pitch and oackim. This also inclosed the articles. I have this day newes that the Akim war with Aquamboe is done, they haveing made up palavera, but cannot affirm it."
2771,3,1133,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,09/12/1695,Fort,RAC,"My last to you was per Bastian, which advised of the palavera I made with the Anguinna's. This comes only to accompanye my September, October and November accompts. The ballance, being 3oz 5a 4_ta, have transferred to the next [ms. 'neas'] accom[pt]s. I have nothing else momentary to advise you saves that the news I heard of the Akim warr with Aquamboe being made up is utterly false. I have sent per bearer four iron crowes, four wood axes and two wedges, one trowell and one hammer, desireing they may be mended and returned per first opportunity."
2772,3,1134,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,17/12/1695,Fort,RAC,"Both yours of the 9th & 14 instant have received, & also the mended iron worck & nailes. I shall furnish Mr Searle with a peice for a flagg staff & canky stones as soon as can gett them ready for him, haveing already sent him planks & axle trees. Per the 15 hand canoe have sent up twenty axle trees, being what we have in readiness. I have sent to the Accroomes (as likewise the Cabbosheers the same) about the slaves, but to no purpose, for they will not returne them by any means, unless the country custome be put in practice. With this comes one of the whipsaux, being broak, desireing it may be mended by first oppertunity."
2773,3,1135,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,24/01/1696,Fort,RAC,"Your I received of the 13 instant, with the bricks & tarras, and desire if you can possible [send] downe one or two canoe more load[ed] with bricks to cover with what [ms. 'wath'] speed wee can the upper roomes, else shall lye lyable to a great deale of damage the raines and tennadoes [= tornadoes] may bring. Last [ms. 'lest'] night the goods in the warehouse received a great deale of wett in a travadoe which came suddenly upon us. Per bearer have sent the other whipsaw, broak, which request may be mended with all speed & send downe with the other saw per returne of the canoe. I request you will likewise sent two or three barrells of powder for the forts use, one sett of bolt pins &a the bolts 17 incles [= inches] & 10 incles long each, & hasps and staples, one hundred iron bars, white or blue pautkies &a."

Per returne of the canoe, that she might not goe up empty, have sent up forty chests corne on the Royall Company accompt. I desire the bricks and sawes and other ironworck may be forwarded. I am really sorry for the alterations of affaires you write of. As yet all here verry quiet, only the Accroomes still detained the fugitive slaves and will in noe wise release them."
2775,3,1137,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,06/02/1696,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 4th instant I yesterday received, & immediately on sight sent away the canoemen for Accra, who are just now returned & bring news that three great canoes are now at a grapling at Barracu, & came with them from Accra. I have given the Cabbasheers & people of the towne powder and shott, & shall presently, so soon as can muster the men together, which are but few here, here being but four canoes, to send them off to panyar them. I have likewise sent powder and shott & liquor to the Cabbasheers of [ms. 'to'] Barracu to give their assistance, that if any be ashoar to panyar them, so if the enterprise take effect shall suddenly advise you. I send the canoe away in case we miss of them here, to advise you timely of their comeing. According to your orders, I sent yesterday to Acong, as also to the rest of Acrom Cabbasheers, and sent them liquor. They have sent there solders to Apom & promise their assistance and to panyar all the Mine canoes they meet with. They desired each a cloth, so have sent them each a cloth to encourage them. I have sent powder & liquor to Apom people."
2776,3,1138,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,07/02/1696,Fort,RAC,"This is to acquaint you that the people I sent of have panyard the 3 Mina canoes I yesterday wrote of. One is a 13 hand canoe, the other two 11 hand & a 7 hand canoes, the men in all thirty two [ms. 'tow'], six whereof are wounded. They are loaden with empty sheet chests, but cannot as yet tell how many. The canoes as yett lie att a grapling. The men I have in the fort, but am att a great loss to secure them, haveing not one paire of irons to putt them in, soe request you will send twenty or thirty paire as soon as you receive this, else it will be very dangerous either to lett them lye here or send them up, which if you soe doe pray lett the canoe men you send be very well armed. The people that panyard the canoes doe expect some considerable reward, also Acuma, who went in person, one of the Cabbosheers, to gett the Cabbosheers of Barracu assistance their, who sent off their canoes on their approach to assist them, who I presume expect likewise some gratuity. The bussiness is very expensive to me in liquor, which hope may be allowed to be charged, as likewise other expenses. Mr Searles canoe putting in here on her way up, have delivered [to] the canoemen to take this with them, and also have sent the December and January accompts, duplicates whereof will send by next opportunity. I have not taken enough this two las[t] months to defray fort charges, as per accompt appeares, for want of vendable goods, which now, the Fauconberg being arrived, hope may be supplyed with goods following per first opportunity, blue perpetuanoes, sheets, Welch plaines, powder, knives 1 lb basons, herba longees, fine sletias, & ca, a good quantity of each.
PS. I desire you would send irons for the forts use. Pray lett me have brick per first opportunity, with six [or] seaven white souldiers and a Gunner. I have the Copeman of Accra's letter to the Mine and one other. Yesterday died one of the men slaves."
2777,3,1139,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,11/02/1696,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 8th instant I received, with twenty pairs of irons, with which [ms. 'which with'] I have secured the prisoners panyard, and have secured what was in each canoe. The black[s] that panyard them would never lett me be at rest till I had satisfied them, & hardly could make them stay till the arrivall of your canoe. They would have no less then 2o a man, which with [ms. 'with which'] the Barracues made in all 50 men. so I distributed to the value of three bendys amongst them, which I thought I had better doe, that they might be willing to goe on any occasion another time, so that with the other expenses of liquor & powder &c the charge will amount to about a mark of gold. I should be glad to hear of a good issue between both Taggees.
PS. Just upon sealing of this came to anchor off the road out of gunnshott a Portuguze & a Flemish shipp, I beleive belonging] to the Dutch, to trappan the canoes of this place, & others that pase by. I have ordered that none should goe to them, they have both canoes & boats after them. I have ordered the canoe men to sinck the letters if they meet with canoes that offer to panyar them."
2778,3,1140,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,15/02/1696,Fort,RAC,"This conveyance presenting comes to conduct the duplicates of my last December and January accompts, and to acquaint you of the death of one of the wounded men that were panyard in great canoes. Here is nothing momentory since my last, save only that wee are in great want of bricks &ca, and if you
could spare a carpenter would much secure the fort against the raines, the black
carpenter I have being not able to forward what is to be done without assistance."

PS. I desire if you think conveinent to order some dashee to Attabo and the Anguinnas to draw off their designe."
2780,3,1142,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,06/03/1696,Fort,RAC,"I wrote you yesterday express, about Atabo (at the Dutch instigation) his designe to force me to deliver up the Mine canoemen, but as yett cannott learne the truth of it no otherwise then as Mr Searles letter notif[i]es, tho have made exact inquiry into itt. I presume the thing was carried on by Prince and Attabo very privately, unknown to the rest of the Anguinas.
This comes to accompany my January accompt, haveing not hade a trade to defray the Factory charges more than by the accompt appears. This likewise accompany Serjeant Laird, who being desirous to goe home by the Fauconberg, and fearing to loose opportunity, desired leave to come up to be discharg'd, soe request per returne of the canoe you will supply mee with another in his rooome. I desire you will send by first opportunity, with what else already writt for, 3 or 4 bailes of carpetts, those I have remaining being most of them considerably damaged. The [omission] I have most of the cask are flown in pieces, and the sayes lie and spoyl in the cases, so hope you will please to order what is left [what is] to be done with them. What tarris came last most of it is used, desire when you send brick &c to send 3 or 4 hogsheads of tarris. The whipsaws lately mended are almost spoiled, that the sawers can hardly work with them, if you have any new ones come over desire you will send one or two, and likewise two or three stock locks. I have received the six iron hooks, 40 line pins, and one halfe round file.
PS. I payd the Serjeant to last pay day, February 28th 1695/6."
2781,3,1143,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,14/03/1696,Fort,RAC,"All yours dated the 4th, 7th & 9th instant have received, & according to that per Capt. Browne I have received on the Royall Affrican Companys accompt three hundred twenty five sheets, one hundred blew perpetuanoes, ten cases of spirritts, twenty blew Welch plaines, twenty red & twenty yellow ditto, four hundred one pound pewter basons, & 74 gallons of rum. I have not yet put aboard the slaves, Capt. Brown promising to take them aboard att his returne from Accra, but I have put aboard all the Mine canoe men to prevent disturbance. The canoe men sent downe to carry up the 13 hand canoe panyard [I] do keep here till the returne of the ship, Capt. Browne promising to carry up the canoe & the canoemen with him, the canoe being very heavy to paddle, and putting aboard the Mine men make a great noise, I am fearfull to venture her up, and the canoe men are all afraid, hearing the Dutch Galley waites att sea for her. By the ship will likewise return the 5 hand canoe.
Att Ata's arrivall I sent for Attabo to mak the pallaver here, who immediately came downe, to whom I laid the palaver Mr Searle acquainted me with, in presence of Capt. Browne, but he utterly denied that ever he had correspondence with the Dutch Copeman of Accra, or that ever he thought of such a thing, but says that he has heard that three or four of the Cabbasheerrs (who he has lately had difference with) hath carried on this intrigue, and to settle a factory in his name, and if they will not desist from it he will fight them. He hath againe taken a fetish to be true to the English Company, and also Prince, who says that the same was utterly unknown to him. I have given Atabo the cloth and case of spiritts, with which he was very well pleased, and Prince one case of spiritts, who will come quickly to Cabo Corso. The Queen is not yett come from Tantum Queery, so have not yett given her the cane &a. Two days since a messenger arrived from the Mine att Mumford, who came with accompanyed with those Cabbasheers to the salt pond, where they sent for the Cabbasheers of this towne to meet them, who before they went acquainted me with itt, and att there return they told me the Mine Cabbasheers had sent to know why they panyard the Mine canoes, and offered them money if they would deliver them up againe, but the Cabbasheers told them the pallaver was not theirs, and that if ever they expected to have them they must make their adress to you, and that if the Mine people panyard any of their canoes on that accompt, they would kill all the Mine people they could meet with. This I thought needfull to acquaint you with, tho the canoemen are safe aboard. I have not any lime to spare, haveing none but the Mine canoemen to fetch shells these five weeks, and what they have fetched are all used, except enough for one small kiln unburnt, and cannot expect any quantity till the raines have broke open the salt pond. The girder and joice I will gett ready by first opportunity. I keep Atta, in expectation of the four Cabbasheers above mentioned, hoping to make all well up with them."
2782,3,1144,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,23/03/1696,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 19th instant I have received, and according to your orders therein, shall use my utmost endeavours to keep the Dutch from ever settling in these parts. Since my last, I sent Atta to Anguinna, who brought downe all the Cabbasheers with him. whom I examined about the pall[a]ver the Dutch hath been tampering with. They own'd the Copeman of Accra had sent to them concerning the Mine canoe men and also setling of a factory, but said withall they returned him answer that the Dutch were strangers to them, and that the English were settled already, and would suffer no other to settle in this countrey. They likewise confessed they was to blame in not acquainting me of it themselves, and promised for the future if the Dutch send any more errands to them, they will immediately acquaint me of it. With much adoe I made up the breach between Attabo and them, who are all returned friends. They would not be satisfied till I gave them a blue plaine, and ten gallons of mmm I expended amongst them. I have assured them that if they prove true to the English they should not on any occasion want what assistance you can give them, with which they were satisfied. Wee are in great want of bricks and tarris, which request you will send per first opportunity.
PS. This day a Portuguese by name Francis Gonsolous. haveing deserted a Portuguze ship, came hither and desired to be entred for a solder to serve the Royall Company as a souldier for three years, and desires to remaine here in this place, whom I have entertained att 8a 4ta per month, presuming you would not disaprove of itt. here being so few men.
I have sent up by this conveyance eight wood axes to be mended, and desire if you have any new and larger you will send some, these being to small.
There is now a ship to windward towards Apom which I believe is the Fauconberg. If it be I am disappointed both in sending the slaves, timber and canoe."
2783,3,1145,William Cooper,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,24/03/1696,Fort,RAC,"Since the other of yesterdays date Capt. Browne arrived here, aboard of whom I have put on accompt of the Royall Company four men & two women slaves (one woman remaining, being sick), and also the 13 hand canoe &c.

The Doctor hath been very ill, but I hope is upon recovery. My hands being very lame could not make up my accompts, but now shall goe about them as well as I can, haveing left 12 mark at Anamaboe, which suppose will be near the ballance, which therewith intend to send by Mr Cooper. Also Thomas Allners money have left there, 12 ounces. Therefore I returne you many thanks for your late kindness, especially for the employ you have been pleased to give me, which is mightily to my content, and hope in God shall behave myself therein according to your pleasure and interest of the Royall Company.

I want goods (vizt) perpetuanoes, powder, sheets &ca for some Arkim traiders who are here. Your linguist Quo I beleive does the Company more harme than good by his rouguish pallavours, also corrupts my servants and devotes them more to his owne service than mine, which being very ill and weak cannott hinder. My Serjeant, Gunner and two souldiers are ill of a feavour and ague, and for my self, have not been well one hour since my being here, but almost continually lightheaded, that am many times unsenceable of what I doe, wherefore desire you will take me for Cape Coast, or send some person to be a second or assistant, while I am in this condition, for am not able to take care my self as I ought neither of the Companyes nor my own concerns.

Wherefore desire you will please to send money for the payment of our soldiers, who are in great want thereof, haveing four months pay due to them, and have been extreamly importunate with me therfore. In my last wrote you concerning the knavish tricks of your linguaster, which you were not pleased to notice. I did not think proper to send you the slaves you wrote for until I had acquainted you with the present affaires, it being now the time to fetch shell to build our spurr and finish the fort, the men being allso needfull as times are for the preservation therof.

Sirs, I am in want of powder, haveing but little in the Castle, also some good armes, some hand granadoes, spunge nailes, sheepskins and a block for the flagstaff. The Anguines have great differance amongst themselves about panyaring the Barracoe people, insomuch I am this morning advised they are embroyled in civill warrs, and will shortly have a fight. I suppose the Dutch gold has been amongst them allso. When he was downe here Attabo, at the time of Mr Coopers goeing, offered for tenn bendys to drive the Dutch from Apung, which by reason of my sickness forgott to advise till now. Inclosed goes a petition from Richard Hearding.
PS. Here is some corne belonging to the Company received from Mr Cooper, which unless disposed will be in a short time good for nothing. Per the canoe I have sent you one [ms. 'owne'] crowe, four malls, two axes, one shovell, also one muskitt out of order.

I suffered soe much for Dickies Cove, I desire, allso resolve not to undergoe the same here.

The other day our centinell had liked to have been stabd at the gate for denying entrance to a number of Blacks when ordred to the contrary, whose part our Serjeant took and with his cane forct to drive them off. I beleive he has received a dose therfore, being taken with a vomitting and strange paines of which he is now very ill. Our Gunner allso.

Since I had a powerfull and sufficient reason for what I did, I have advised you that I am not in a condition to continue in this employ, which you please not to notice, and I further give you to understand that two of my security is broke, and therefore am unfitting to be trusted.

The reason I trouble you herewith is to desire you will please to send the goods last wrote for as soone as possible, the want whereof (last pay day) forced me to disburst considerable of my owne towards payment of our people. Accroon [= Accoon] and the Accroome Cabbosheers hath been with me to offer you a settlement at Apong, and desire your answer. Attabo and the Winneba's have ended their Barracoe pallavers, and are now friends, he having been with me to desire the Anguinnas may be supplyed with powder, gunns and lead barrs, they being with the Aikims in armes against Quambo and expect shortly to fight.

2801,3,1163,Thomas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,16/04/1698,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 16th ultimo came to hand, the contents whereof I observe, and am heartily sorry for so generall a decay of trade, also the Companyes neglect of supplyeing with such goods as are vendable, wherefore desire you will please to send me some knives and tallow by first opportunity. Our business is so small cannot defray the charge of the factory, which makes me very uneasie, being dayly importuned by the souldiers &ca, if not paid at their due times, insomuch that I shall not know what to doe, having not wherewithall of my owne therfore, and indeed if anybody ought to disburst for the Company, such as have received extraordinary favours should not be wanting, wherein doe not beleive my selfe to be concerned.
PS. In the coppy of my accompts to ultimo January (through mistake) have omited the corrall, wherefore desire to know whither in that at Cabo Corso, it is mentioned."
2802,3,1164,Thomas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,19/04/1698,Fort,RAC,"James Debow yesterday in the evening did absent himselfe from the fort and was not to be found in the towne or bushes adjoyning, wherefore somwhat affter the usuall time shutt our gates, defering our search till this morning, which appearing sent one of my boys to Appom, to enquire of him there, who being denyed by the Copeman was casually seen of the boy, but not returned, wherefore have sent
this purposely to advise, and know your worshipps pleasure therein. He has been a very troublesome fellow, and not fitt to live in an outfactory."
2803,3,1165,Thomas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,25/04/1698,Fort,RAC,"I received yours of the 21st instant, wherein according to your custome (through some ill minded grudge) I find you much harpe on my duty, without any neglect to my knowledge, wherefore cannot perceive your reason, unless to buggbeare me, for I presume have not omited any thereof, by demanding my sallery, which expected before (or at least by this time), according to yours of the 16th ultimo, and thereby should have been better [en]abled to have bore the factory charge untill accompts made, which fear not you shall speedily have, wherefore it is my sallery [omission] I did then mention concerning the Company is true, and no reflection as you tearme it.
I doe not boast to have done them extraordinary service, neither have I received any favour to encourage me thereto, nor even what I agreed with them for, and I doe not think its worth my labour to apply my selfe to them therefore, or when my time expired worth my acceptance. Nott long since you sent me about sixty gallons of rumme, which to please you was forced to accompt for a hundred, although am oblidged to purchase brandy to give the Negroes for quiettness sake, which refuse and will not drink the other, whereby my sallery being much diminished, also not paid when required, and having no profitt can scarce live, yett notwithstanding I am dayly taunted and abused when I offer my just demands, for which reason affter Christmas intend home, God willing, which occasions me to trouble you so much herein, that with my sallery I may partly discharge my debts, that thereby I may not be abstructed [= obstructed]. In my last I wrote you that Debow was with the Dutch at Apom, and refused my message, who [I] desire, if sent back, may not remaine here, being not to be governed at an out factory. Attaboe and the Anguinnas are already gone to assist the Arcanyes.
PS. Pray, Sirs, advise whether in my last accompt have omited the corrall."
2804,3,1166,Thomas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,31/05/1698,Fort,RAC,"I received yours of the 16th instant, with one to Capt. Martin, which delivered, and herewith have sent accompts to the present date, the ballance being 1a 3t due to factory charges. I had nott money for our souldiers &ca further then 25th Febbruary, and pay day being againe att hand they will have four months due to them, which desire you will send by returne of this canoe, or know nott how they may be sattisfied, for att present they dayly trouble me therefore. I shall nott dispute your actions nor designes, whither partiall or noe, which time to
uninterested persons will shortly make appear. The grant you give Thomas Tunnbridge, a private souldier and in health, who comes herewith, more for his intrest in tradeing then other respects, and the many denialls wherewith my requests of coming to Cabo Corso have been offten repulsed att times when I might have offten been spared, notwithstanding they were forced and back'd with the most urgent and necessitious reasons, of violent and extraordinary sickness, may I beleive, in every judicious man's opinion, savour somthing of partiallity."
2805,3,1167,Thomas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,09/06/1698,Fort,RAC,"I have received yours of the 7th instant, and perceive the error in my accompts, which not being sent desire you will please to add two ounces corrall to the debtor side and the remains thereof, makeing the same 107 and 62, which shall notice in my next accordingly. You should not faile of monthly accompts were there trade, or anything to accompt off. I perseive that you have little reason to fear my running out, and less of any other dealings, as the times att present are. Sirs, this comes, in complyance to your order, for money to pay your souldiers &ca, which will have four months due to them, wherefore shall refer to your wisdome and my accompts for what will be needfull. Both my temper and custome is undoubtedly like other men's, when abused to endeavour my justification, and when ill used to complaine, untill by some means may have redress, which doubt not one way or other in short time to obtaine, if some extraordinary preventions doe nott intervene. I am noe judge of your dealings, nor can I censure you in a matter relateing to my selfe. However can be sencible of my ill usage, and know noe reason therefore. I have offten desired my sallery, which doe once more, for having perused my agreement with the Company, find my selfe under noe obligation of duty or service unless paid yearly, wherefore if it must still be unpaid desire liberty to goe off the Coast by first conveyance in order to returne home, tho' am desireous to serve the Royall Company, yett still unwillingly continue to be soe grossly abused as hitherto by their Cheifs.
PS. I have herewith sent you a man slave for accompt Company.
The man you sent lately hither hears his companions have sould his chest and cloaths, wherefore desires your favor therein, being much necessitated for want of them."
2806,3,1168,Thomas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,17/06/1698,Fort,RAC,"The bearer hereof was the other day putt on shore from a small West Country bark, commanded by one Charles Ellard, who being desireous to serve the
Royall Company hath procured his passage to Cabo Corso in order for his application to you therefore."
2807,3,1169,Thomas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,30/06/1698,Fort,RAC,"I received yours of the 21st instant with two marks three angles and seaven
taccoes gold to pay the souldiers to 17th ditto, also one mark five ounces two
angles and six taccoes for eighteen months sallery from the 2d August 1696 to the 2d Febbuary last 1697/8, haveing once before been paid for halfe a year, soe that the 2d August next shall have six months further due to me, at which time two years a halfe will be expired since my arivall in this country. Yesterday Accon sent one of his wives &ca to acquaint me that he would put the Dutch from Apom, haveing been thereby required by a messenger you lately sent from Cabo Corso, wherefore thought necessary to advise you, tho' doubt his performance. Sirs, this morning opening a bale perpetuanoes, number 8, find some of them to be much damaged. I notice what you sent me concerning the Cabbosheers &ca. I have by this canoe sent you two men and one woman slaves for accompt Company, also Richard Homing, being much troubled with sickness &ca, goe[s] herewith, in whose roome desire another."
2808,3,1170,Thomas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,09/07/1698,Fort,RAC,"This comes to desire fifty blue perpetuanoes for accompt of the Royall
Company, for whose ditto have sent two men, one woman slaves. If concerning my sallery I have made a mistake, extraordinary sickness has been the occation, by which my memory has been and is soe shortned, I am almost uncapable of business, wherefore therein doe refer my selfe, trusting I shall not be injured. Sirs, one of our slaves named Coffe, the day affter being paid, goeing to Mumford to buy corne with some knives he had received, was between that and Apom sett upon by one of the Dutch boys and two of their slaves, who killed him with more then 25 stabbs in his body, also cutting his neck round to the bone. I sent the Winneba's &ca to bury him there, and demand sattisfaction. Quanso and Tutuba also doe the same, which I hope and beleive may put them from thence, if you will give any thing therefore, without which Blacks palavers are faust [sic: = false?], and little worth."
2809,3,1171,Thomas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,18/07/1698,Fort,RAC,"Have both yours of the 13th and 15th instant, the former whereof arived somewhat too late. Quanso and Accoone, who three or four dayes did lye before
Apom, not hearing from you, had delivered the murderer of Cuffee to the Dutch Coapman, haveing received six bendyes therefore, as I am informed. However, sent Linguister Quo to the latter [= Accoone] with your pallaver, which told him the business was not then ended, notwithstanding what they had received, but that he intended to execute his promise in turning them off, provided he could be secure of your settleing there when done, which would help to excuse his action with the Accrong Cabbosheers, espetially such as had pawnes at the Mina, wherefore he required that in order thereto you would send some white men to Quansaws Croome, the better to dispose the people, untill it should be effected. Haveing received the above mentioned answer, I sent him with some liquor to sollicitt Tutteba &ca, who seemed to be well pleased and promised to comply with your desires, demanding three perpetuanoes and a halfe barrell powder, which have just delivered to Prince and her messengers, who are this night to returne. and make preparation therefore, which being ended tenn bendyes will very well thank them. They send for Accoone, with whome they intend to confederate herein, and intend in the next week, the boon dayes beginning then. I much want some brandy for this affair or cases of spirits, which desire by returne of my canoe. The latter being offten required will sell, or if none can purchase of Mr John Davis, in a sloope from Barbadoes what will bee needfull, if you please to allow it. He is now a little to leward of this road with the company. Also a Dutch interloper advises that on the Graine Coast he spoke with a great English Companys shipp. I have sent you two men, one woman slaves for ditto accompt on accompt of ditto.
PS. I have related to you all particulars, but leave the judgement of it's reall[i]ty to your wisdome, haveing been offten deceived in Blacks pallavers, but am of opinion it may have it's desired effect."
2810,3,1172,Thomas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,25/07/1698,Fort,RAC,"Have received both yours of the 17th and 22d instant, with eight pair Negro irons. Also hearing that some Arkim traders are arived, and others suddenly expected at Unguinna [= Anguinna], desire (in complyance to your orders) to be supplyed by first opportunity with goods mentioned as at foot hereof, or such of them as you have or can spare, for accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England. I hear Prince hath offered himselfe to remaine at Apom affter the business shall be compleated, untill you send there to settle. Attaquo the other day brought downe fettishes, and put in the ground, demanding for the fettisher half a perpetuanoe, which being delivered he returned, haveing first assured me they


had received encouragement therefrom. I have by this canoe sent you one man, two women slaves, also four pair of shakles unserviceable.
PS. Goods: 12 chests sheets, 2 three pounds pewter basons, screwed juggs, quarter barrells powder if any, cases of spirits, tapseils, nicconeese and woollen carpets, red perpetuanoes, pintadoes and paper brawles, blue plaines, pautkies white and blue Guinea clouts, some more iron barrs, white blanketts, a piece of blue cloath for Cabbosheers and long cloath for a flagg.
Sirs, I must desire you will please to use the corne here for the first occations, or in a small time if not already it will be good for little or nothing. I want ink, paper and penknife.
I have sent the coppyes of my accompts. I desire if any letters for me you will please to give them my canoemen, one mentioned to be sent being not come."
2811,3,1173,Thomas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,03/08/1698,Fort,RAC,"I wrote you on the first instant by Cabbosheer Ball, who with George Devonport the last night went to Accoone, neare Apom, to assure them of their realty in the ensuing affair, and the latter to remaine with him as a pledge, therefore I presume it now is or will suddenly reach your hands, to which, for further advice I must at this time refer you. Quansaw is at present with me and intends for Accron tomorrow. The occation herefore to desire the goods wrote for soe soon as possible, more particularly the sheets and some powder, of which have not one barrell in the fort, and much wanted. I have herewith sent you a man and a woman slaves, for Companys accompt, and desire a white man instead of the above mentioned.
PS. I hope wee shall have a considerable trade. I have severall slaves, which by first shall send you."
2812,3,1174,Thomas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,05/08/1698,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 3d instant I received and notice, in complyance wherewith shall endeavor what I can to procure a canoe for Whidah voyage of the Prince of Orange, butt fear too little effect, unless you please to spare that I bought for the Royall Company, and remains here for the use of this factory, which Capt. Daniells carpenter has seen and very well likes. She is somewhat damaged by a splitt she received near her head, in carrying of shell when the seas ran high, but may well be mended, and is far better as he sayes then any at Cabo Corso.Your last to me was the 30th ultimo, since which have wrote you the 1st, 3d, 4th and this the 5th instant, to which refer you.
Serjeant Sutton hath wrote a petition to goe home, which upon his request have here inclosed."
2813,3,1175,Thomas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,14/08/1698,Fort,RAC,"Haveing sent you four letters which are unanswered, with six men and six women slaves by the last two hand and great canoe, the 3d and 5th instant, for accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England, and which you have not yett noticed, also being in want of the goods I have desired, with some tallow, is the occation hereof, to desire your dispatch herein, as soone as possible. Accoone hath sent twice he will be suddenly with the white man, near Appom.
PS. I have some good slaves by me, and loth to send untill I hear from you."
2814,3,1176,Thomas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,23/08/1698,Fort,RAC,"I received yours of the 17th instant, with the goods therein mentioned, and as per contents, save one halfe case spirits, being forced to fill up the other (that had been opened and stole) therewith, I presume [stolen] in their passage from Cabo Corso here, as two chests of your sheets and some iron barrs would also a been had I not much stirred therein, for they were denyed by the sloops master, who I suppose intended them for himselfe, or next Barbadoes interloper. Sirs, by reason of the many pallavers and much business have not been able to finish my accompts, but the latter end of this month if you please, shall send them. I presume you have new Factors suffitient for your occations, therefore if you shall send one to discharge me this employ, shall be much oblidged to you, for in a little time I designe home, and after the 2d February next will nott stay in this service.
PS. Since writeing the afforegoeing, haveing some occation to open casks pewter, found them to be both one pound basons, wherefore desire by this canoe some of two pounds."
2815,3,1177,Thomas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,27/08/1698,Fort,RAC,"I received yours of the 23d and 24th instant, wherein I notice your orders concerning the spiritts, which shall comply with in the cases [that] remains, being noe more then three of the large sort, but am sorry for the mistake that has happened. This comes to desire a larger supply of tallow, which is now wanted. the former being disposed, with some more of the halfe cases spiritts and the musquets you mention, which are not yett come.
I observe your pleasure in the business of Appom, and shall doe my utmost as well to serve my masters as to reveng[e] the unspeakable injurys have received from those villaines. I dare beleive Anguinna will performe their parts, and if not as you would have itt, Quanza, who have highly treated therefore, and Accoone will be the only hinderance, wherefore beleive itt necessary for you to deale with them. I have by this canoe sent a man and woman slave for Companys accompt, and have some others by me which if you please will putt on board the Prince Orrange, to whome have sent your great canoe, and is yett to windward takeing of corne. I beleive shall have money to ballance my accompts at end of this month, which if soe desire if I shall send itt by a two hand canoe herewith, or wait your orders, by reason the seas are dangerous, and my canoe had like lately to have been robbed.
PS. Pray send me paper to write.
I shall now be glad of your discharge, for my present being here is by force and against my will much.

2816,3,1178,Thomas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,11/01/1699,Fort,RAC,"I sent you by the Fauconberge nine men with two women Gold Coast, allso two men, eight women Ardah slaves, the receipt off which you did not notice. However have made my accompts accordingly to ultimo December, which comes inclosed. Also have sent herewith one woman slave, to compleat the ballance of the slaves therein mentioned.
The ballance of gold due to the Royall Company amounts to mks8 5oz 9a 9t, which have sealed up and remaines for your order. The Fauconberge sailed before had oppertunity of putting it on board.
I earnestly desire you will supply us soe soone as possible with men and armes, the former being partly ill, some of them nott and others hardly able to doe their duty, the latter have none fitt for service, whereby tho' in a fort shall nott be able to defend either the Companys intrest or ourselves.
I am sorry for the death of Mr William Cooper."
2817,3,1179,Thomas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,20/01/1699,Fort,RAC,"I wrote you on the 11th instant, with which sent my accompts to ultimo December, the ballance whereof, amounting to eight marks five ounces nine angles nine taccoes, remains for your order. My canoe nott being yett returned with your answer occasions me to advise hereof by this, which is chiefely to acquaint you on the 17th instant came hither the Queen and Attaboe, who yesterday opened their pallaver, and desired (as I once before wrote) you would trust them twelve bendys, to be stopped from the former untill repaid by her monthly rent, which nott haveing a power to consent to, she was extravigantly pationate, telling me the English had killed Great Taggee, caused the Dancra's to panyar Attaboe, had allmost brought them on her country, and that wee desired to loose our trade, however in the end was pretty well pacified when I promised to write and intreat you therefore, for which reasons I earnestly desire, as I have before done, thatt you will supply us with men and armes (of which there are butt three can doe duty) soe spedily as you can, for should anything be offered wee are nott in a condition of defence. Pray send your resolution in the above written affair, and accordingly lett us be prepared for any accident thatt may happen, for I verily beleive if her demands are refused she will offer violence to the Companys concerns here."

Attaboe &ca hath been busie with me for small lone [= loan] (which, haveing noe power therefore, could not comply with). He is now gone to Accroone, intending to returne in 7 or eight dayes, and build a habbitation near Winneba, being very much dissatisfied with severall of the country people, for sundry abuses they have offered to his concernes there the time he was absent.
I have received your six musquets and twelve granadoes. The four white men you mention are also arived here with their two musquets.
I have waited for the returne of the slope from Accra, but I presume she is past by or not come from thence, wherefore have not as yett had a conveniency of sending up the Companys money thereby according your orders. However if shee should not be come up, and calls on me therefore in her returne, shall be sure to put it on board.
The time I contracted to serve the Royall Affrican Company of England was expired on Thirsday last, being the 2d of this instant, and my selfe (by reason of sickness and want of necessary remedys) being very unable to continue any longer in this imploy, also some affaires requireing my returne for England, I desire you will please to discharge me thereof, and give me liberty to come for Cabo Corso in order to have my passage home by the first good opportunity.

However cannot butt notice your fraudulent indeavours therein, which being correspondent with your other abuses, as I can make appeare, must tell you that I at this instant am not oblidged, neither will I serve to be abused nor endeavour to give you any further sattisfaction therein then receipt from under hers, Apparaco['s], Quo['s], and my Serjeants hands may give to any reasonable person, more especially when their order has been therefore.
I must tell you that my usage has been most meane and unworthy since my being upon this Coast of late, which I can in divers manners make appeare, and shall not fear standing to, wherefore I doe here declare and protest that by reason of the unaccomptable and manyfold abuses, and likewise your consistance therein, when especially soe civilly my discharge was desired, I am fearfull your designes are to prejudice of my life, and that little estate God has been pleased to bestow on me, which the almighty providence I hope may protect, and send me clear from such villany shall be both the endeavour and prayers of [myself].
[PS] You take noe notice of the receipts I sent you in my last, inclosed, nor any thing that makes against your humour.

The knives will not goe at 8 per 1a but at 10, as you directed per the first supply of the sloope, neither will they give 5a per umbanees and 12a per peice of long cloth, as to the other goods I have brought them to compliance. Corne here is none to be had, neither good nor bad, I am forced to send my Bumboy to waylay the Quambooers, to force them to bring the litle that comes downe to supply my occations. Our trade is at present stopt, by reason our best traders under the command of Aheni[s]ah[s] cousin Ado are gon to fight to leeward, which occationed a stoppage also to the leeward trade. I wrote to you in my last for severall materialls wanting. I received nothing in answer. This was intended you some days agoe, but my indisposition which hath held me this nine dayes with a violent feavor hindered my intent. Inclosed goes my Aprill accompt and ballance amounting to 14mk 3oz 3a, which you will receive per bearer.

You may also send us some sheets, which now goes of apace, not forgetting some striped Turkey carpitts. Trade is now on a mending hand. I am sorry to informe you that Mr William Cooper is in such a condition, his senses being taken away, I feare will not live untill next day. Our Doctor is also taken ill of a violent feaver.

I wrot you some time past for a supply of goods, since which per yours of the 22d ditto I find that you will send up per the Supply, which I hope may not be long. If you have any powder in halfe or quarter barrells pray dispatch them downe. Wee shall want also some knives. This you will receive per returne of your Braffo, and may signifye that Mr William Cooper, who after haveing given over allmost for dead, is now on a mending hand. Mr Samuell Humfryes went hence yesterday morning. Wee are extreemly in want of mawles, iron wedges, pick axes, and iron crow, to break stones to finish the plattforms towards the sea, which will be a great security to the Fort when done.

I have also put on board him 16 butts of oystershells for ballase [= ballast]. This night he intends to make the best of his way to your parts.

The supply of goods sent by him I am now takeing ashoare. I wrott you last for more blue, redd and green perpetuanoes, which pray send per the shipp Supply. If any saccorguntes, pray send per ditto conveyance, but noe allijars. The quantity of Negroes you advised for the said vessell I feare cannot be hadd, verry few presenting at present. By the bearer you will receive 47m 6o la 8ta for ballance of my June accompt as per inclosed. Since my last to you Master Niccolis Pepperell made sundrey motions to gett up to your parts, but all in vain, he is driven as low as the Danes Fort. God knowes when he will gett up, it may be by Christmass he may fulfill his voyage."
2829,3,1191,Mark Bedford Whiting,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,16/07/1691,Fort,RAC,"This is sent you expressly to know weather you have any double flowred silke longees and herba ditto. The latter must be of the redd sort, those we have by us will never reach a vend because they are not so. Hear is also much inquiring for broad pintadoes, which if any by you send us a good quantity per the shipp Supply, with the blew, redd and green perpetuanoes wroute you before. Lett this signifie the reciept of all the goods you sent per the Alligater Sloop. Mr Nicholas Peperell in the Discovery is almost out of sight to windward of us."
2830,3,1192,Mark Bedford Whiting,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,05/08/1691,Fort,RAC,"This accompanyes the Alligater Sloope, Mr Leonard Jefferys master, by whom goes eighteen butts of oyster shells for ballace. If you will have me procure a quantity of shells pray advise timely, here being no more remayning."
2831,3,1193,Mark Bedford Whiting,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,11/08/1691,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 31st past came to hand by the shipp Supply. Capt. James Lashly, by whome I have received all the Company's effects you mentioned in the said letter. Slaves I have none. The scarcity of corne in these leward parts prevented my answering what you directed. What elce you ordered, I shall be asured to follow. This had been with you sooner had not I been much out of order with the gripes. By the bearer have sent you 11mk 2oz 3a 3ta. Our trade has been much decreased of late, by reason our best traderes are gone down to fight a place on this side the River of Vulter. The aforesaid summe is the ballance of July


accompt, as per ditto inclosed accompt appears. The iron work sent downe last being not work[ed] well togeather, is broken in peces especially, neither where they halfe bigg enought for our use, wee have had little or no service out of them, as also the iron wedges.
[PS] Mr Jefereyes in the Alligater sloop is now at Lague."
2832,3,1194,Mark Bedford Whiting,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,03/09/1691,Fort,RAC,"This comes on purpose to desire a supply of sheets, perpetuanoes blue & read, some seyes, lead barrs, and saccerguntes. The herba longees that came last are not good collours, sundreys worme eaten, which came by the ship Supply, James Lashly Commander, who whent from hence for Arda the 14th past. I am sorry my accompts cannot be made up to accompany this canoe, the cause is being retar[d]ed by extream sickness & gripeings, which has taken away the use of both my hands, my right especially. Wee are extreamly in whant of a carpenter, which makes things run very much to ruin, formerly you writt I might be suplied with such a man from you when desired. The iron work sent last is all broken to peices, so that wee are at present in as much want as before.
Postscript. I had allmost forgott to informe you that Serjeant Cole was left behind in a miserable condition, but now I hope he may doe well. This may also advice you that John Sherwin, souldier, through misery of the French pox, which continually attended him, through his daly debauchery, though our Doctor often warned him to the contrary, hanged himself in his bed to end his miserable life."
2833,3,1195,Mark Bedford Whiting,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,17/09/1691,Fort,RAC,"This accompanyes the Allegator Sloop, Mr Leonared Jeffereys master, by whome I received all the goods you sent by her. By the same conveyance goes no oyster shells, by reason could not gett any in a readiness, you may expect some per the next."
2834,3,1196,Mark Bedford Whiting,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,10/10/1691,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 9th instant came safe to hand with the inclosed coppy from the Royall African Company, both which I have perused. This per returne of the same canoe, & in complyance of your orders my endeavor shall not be wanting to purchase what slaves presents that are good. Wee are in dayly expectation of the returne of the Quamboers which went downe to fight to leeward, & that slaves may be then more plently then now. By this conveyance you will receive what irons and rings for long irons wee have that are out of order for want of bolts, which I desire may be fixt & sent per the sloope. If we should meet with slaves, we should want them, the good ones wee have are but few. I wrote you last Tuesday expresly for some goods & materials. I must also desire you send what is neccessary for a strong doare case for the plattforme. I am sorry for the lose of the Guinea Friggatt & lose of the accompts sent by her, and then it is out of my power at present to writt over my accompts again, being so disabled by the weakness of my hands, the right espetially, and Mr William Cooper verry ill of the gripes which came upon him yesterday, that so I am at present without assistance and unable to answer the Companys orders as to that matter, unless you can spaire me sombody from your parts that can writte a passable hand, I shall not be wanting to give him direction. Our place is destitute of such a man, unless it be Serjeant Cole, whos at present not much better in his limbs then my self. My last two months accompts are finished, but want some person to writt them faire, as for my part I am ashamed to put pen to paper, & doubt much if you can make any thing of this letter, which I hope you will impute to my weakness.
[PS] Wee shall want mallagata and palm oyle for slaves use. The rings for other irons and long irons are in all 54, send us also some reveets [= rivets] & forelocks, we have none for the irons. Omitted in my last some paper brawles, which pray send also."
2835,3,1197,Mark Bedford Whiting,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,17/10/1691,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 15th instant came safe to hand per the Allegater sloope, Mr Leonard Jeffery es master. The goods sent by him are not as yett ashoare, per next shall acknowledge the receipt. This was intended you yesterday, but the said sloope appearing in the evening prevented me. This also accompanies the ballance of my August & September accompts amounting 56mk 0oz 5a 2ta, which you will receive per bearer. The accompts by reason of Mr William Cooper[s] indisposition, who is now in a mending hand, shall I hope in a few dayes be written faire in order to be sent to you. I am also I thank God much better then I was, haveing recovered more strength in my limbs within this 8 dayes then a month before, as to my health I never was better. Pray advise per next wither I must pay any wages to Coale, if any how much & from what time. I wrote you for some nailes of all sorts, I understand not any to be sent per the sloop, nor revetts or forelocks for the irons. As soon as the goods are landed the said vessell shall returne to you with oystershells. You have also omitted a strong lock for the platforme doore.
[PS] Send us a few trowells for the brickla[y]ers &ca. There is no tooles worth anything for carpenters use, nor no nailes."
2836,3,1198,Mark Bedford Whiting,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,30/10/1691,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 27th instant I have before me and have received the carpenters tooles, nailes, hammers, trowells &ca. This accompanys my August & September accompts, which had been with you some days before had I not met the hard fortune againe on Munday last to be taken with my late distemper insomuch that I am in the same condition & disabled as before. The 26th instant went hence the Allegater sloope, Mr Leonard Jefferyes commander, by whome have returned you cases containing fourty damaged sayes of which I formerly advised you came downe in that condition per the same conveyance. By her have sent no oyestershells, by reason tha[t] the Negroes not complying to measure them with the butt you sent last for that use, neither would they be sattisfied to the contrary that the sloope would not goe without them, since her departure have complyed, & wee are now measuring them against next oppertunity. George Cole went in the sloope."
2837,3,1199,Mark Bedford Whiting,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,16/11/1691,Fort,RAC,"I have had none from you to answere, no more then yours of the 15 past which come per the Allegater sloope with all the goods therein mentioned. This per express is to accompany 30mk of gold, the ballance of my October accompt, being at present unfinished by reason of the loss of the use of my hands, and Mr Cooper sick of the gripes, that I am present destitute of assistance, being forced to make use of the Doctor to write you this letter, yet thank God I never was better in health. The carpinter sent down last per ditto sloope died the last Satterday of a feavour & flux. We have here a Deans souldier, who is a verry good workman that can supply the vacancy if you please to allow him carpinters pay, wee cannot be supplyed with a better. The iron mawles you sent, by reason of their smallnesse & the iron not well worked together, are all broken, with some of the wedges, so that wee want others in their roome, not forgetting two or three iron shovells which wee want much. The quantity of sheets sent last are all disposed, you may supply us with more, as also iron barrs, brawles, pautkies green, blue Welch plaines & green perpetuanoes. As to the other goods wanting, not knowing what sorts are remayning by you I can say nothing to it at present. The sattins received last are much damaged & bad coulours in [ms. 'is'] somuch that they will not vend, one of the 20 peices proved to be but half made, being no more then 4 fatham whereas it should be 8. I wrote you last for strong lock for the platforme doore, which I hope you will send per next. By the sloop went two cases containing 40 damaged sayes. The negers have complyed with the measure, so that the oystershells are ready for the sloope."
2838,3,1200,Mark Bedford Whiting,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,01/12/1691,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 24th past per the Alligator Sloop I have received with all the goods therein mentioned. I perceive that you have not paper brawles nor iron barrs, by reason none was sent per the same conveyance, neither did wee receive any iron shovels, the want of which has made us something tedious in lading the sloope. the Negroes being forced to tak up the shells with their hands, and likewise the white men from the canoe aboard the sloope. I humbly desire that three or four may be sent per returne of this canoe, as also 3 or 4 iron mawles & wedges, with as many deale boards as will fix a new five hand canoe. Wee are also much in want of a grapling & rope for the canoes upon occation. The lock for the platfforme dore we have received, but no staples to hang it on. According to your orders I have inspected my last August accompt, wherein I find the error of the 6 chests corne, which I will make good in the October accompt. As to the error of the ninety sheets as you say in September, I find no such thing in the accompt remayning by me, so humbly desire that the same accompt may be sent per bearer, that so if not right I may rectifye it, you may be assured shall be returned per first with the accompts and ballance, not as yett finished by reason of my lameness, which makes me still uncapable to put my pen to paper. The Company slave the blacksmith by name Odan is now at Aquamboe under the protection of Bonisha, to whome I have sent expressly to demand him. but by reason that the Braffo of Fanteen haveing received two men slaves from the smiths brother for his freedome Bonisha will not deliver him, but desires you to send to the Braffo to know the certainty of this buisiness. The other smith is at Anguina. Advise me what to doe about them."
2839,3,1201,Mark Bedford Whiting,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,18/12/1691,Fort,RAC,"This by a canoe bound to Annamaboe is to advise you that the Alligater sloope went from hence this morning with 35 butts of oystershells. In my last I wrote you for a grapling and rope for the canoes upon occation, which if any you may send per returne of this conveyance. Mr William Cooper is still sick of the gripes, and my self as yet uncapable of putting pen to paper, so that occations my accompt to be behind hand."
2840,3,1202,Mark Bedford Whiting,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,18/12/1691,Fort,RAC,By the sloope goes thirty five butts of shells.
2841,3,1203,Mark Bedford Whiting,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,18/01/1692,Fort,RAC,"This is to informe you that this morning I received from the Royall African Company of England a letter dated the 20th of October 1691 directed to my self, which came per the shipp Fauconbergh, Capt. Francis Butteram, the coppy whereof comes to you here inclosed for your perusall. In complyance to the said letter I intend God willing to embarque in a seaven hand canoe tomorrow, in order to be present at the opening of the said pacquet."

Of the 40 chests of come sent by her I have left 10 on board her for use of the slaves. If you have any red perpetuanoes I desire you to send us some, and if no store as much as will make a new flagg."
2843,3,1205,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,03/05/1692,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 7th and 14th I received. As for slaves here are non to be had, and as little corne, therefor shall not meddle therein. By the Aligator sloope I have received 190 gallons rum on accompt of the Royall African Company of England. Their are 10 gallons marked [= leaked?] out of one of the casks, as Mr Jeffryes can witnesse. Charles Andersone, one of our men, is dead, his concerns will not pay his debts. By this 2 hand canoe I have sent my March and Aprill accompts, and for ballance of the former mk 1 2oz 11a 4ta, and for the latter mk9 2o 3a 1_ ta on accompt of the Royall Company of England. Most of our trade is for sheets, therefor I desire you to send us per first oppertunity 40 chests and some perpetuanoes green and some blanketts by returne of the canoe. Be pleased to send us 2 padlocks, 8 or 10 deall boards and 500 sixpenie naills for Factory use. The late turnadoes haveing blown half the sloops mainsaill away, which Mr Jeffrys does patch up as well as he can, and will sail per first opportunity, we have ladden 30 butts of shells in her. No news but that Affere and part of the Quambures are going to fight to leeward. If Captain Quo remaine at Cabo Corso, here is John Brafoy who desires he may be intertained in the Companies service, he is a very necissarie man in the absence of Captain Quo."
2844,3,1206,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,01/06/1692,Fort,RAC,"I received yours of the 10th ultimo by the Discovery, Mr Charles Sallmon, with 2600 sheets, 10 iron barrs and 500 naills on accompt of the Royall African Company of England. We have laden 24 butts oyster shells by the said ship, which are all we have at present. As soon as possible I shall purchase 100 butt shells, but I am informed we cannot have them this 2 or 3 months yett, because the freshes are very high. Their was 9 pair long irons sent by the sloope which are not yett returned.
[PS] Be pleased to send up per first 50 or 60 cases spiretts."
2845,3,1207,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,09/06/1692,Fort,RAC,"Just now haveing advice of a canoe goeing to Cape Co[a]st I thought fitt to advise you that Robine, the man that formerly lived with Doctor Griffen, is come from Arda, he tells me the King of Whydah has sent Mr Wortley of in ane interloper for some quarell he had with the French that were there. Mr Jackline has sent no letters for you or any elce that I can hear of. This Robine in a few dayes will be worth [= with] you. Capt. Buttram gott all his slaves at Poppo and
had a quick dispatch. We have little trade at present."
2846,3,1208,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,14/06/1692,Fort,RAC,"Some dayes agoe the Deans sent a Factor with goods to Barracow, of which I have notice. I sent Mr David Gualtier to claime the right due to the Royall African Company of England. The natives are werry well satisfyed therewith and desire they may be furnished with some goods such as their occasions do require and in such cace no other nation shall come there, and the Dean is since departed, theirfor I shall send some small matter to supply them at the easiest charge possible. This morning arrived a Deans ship, in which Monsieur Fensman the late Generall is come, I suppose to supply the office he formerly had. As yett I hear no news of affaires in Europe."
2847,3,1209,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,27/06/1692,Fort,RAC,"By yours of the 5th instant I have received the surprizing news of Mr Robert Elwes, and that you are very much indisposed. As for me I have been a fortnight with an extraorrdinary cold, which still containows, so that I am not in a condition to wait upon you at Cabo Corso Castle, therefor desires you would be pleased to supply the vacancy by some other, for as you may judge by sad experience health is to be preferd before honour. I have sent to the Dean to desire him to spare some medicenes, but I suppos he is very ill provided and sent me word he has non. Our Doctor has sent what he can spare. The King of Quambo has stop all trade from the 3 forts. I sent to him to know the reasone, and for answer he said he would have all sorts of goods at the same rates as were sould in King Ahenneshans time. I have represented to him the great charge the Company is at in send[ing] of goods to Guinea, but he wont understand it. I hope in a few dayes we shall put an end to his unreasonable demands. I am heartily sorry that you are both so ill, I pray God give you health, for a man has but little comfort while he labours under sicknese. By this conveyance I have sent my May accompts and for balance mk3 0o 4a 2ta, for which please give me credite.
[PS] We shall have little or no ballance this month."
2848,3,1210,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,03/08/1692,Fort,RAC,"This goes by a canoe bound to the Mina, and is only to advise you that I have had a feaver 20 dayes which is not yett gone, but not so violent now as it has been. I hope to gett quite [= quit] of it with the lose of my flesh and strength, which are gone already. As soone as I recrute a little shall send you my June and July accompts with the balance, which will be but small. The Dane has all the trade, he sells cheaper then we can do and is dispatching a ship for Europe. Fensman himself stayes for a great ship he expects in two months, and as he sayes designs to gett home in her. If you have any letters to send pray dispatch, for the ship will saill in 15 dayes time. I hope you are upon the recovery, which I shall be glade to hear."
2849,3,1211,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,20/08/1692,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 25th instant I have received per Mr Thomas Stephenson, the Dean in which he intends to take his passage will part very speedily. By this canoe have sent you my June and July accompts, and for ballance of the former mk3 6o 1a 8ta, for the latter mk2 0 15a 6ta, together mk5 7o 1a 3ta on accompt of the Royall African Company of England. Our leeward ways have been stoopt a long time, Offree and the Quambous haveing for a long time had a designe to fight the King of Whydah, so that here is no cattle to be had, for we have non but what comes from the leeward. If any happens to come I shall buy them and advise you by the first conveniency. I desire you would be pleased to send us as much plank or timber as will make 6 guns carriages, sundry of ours being rotten and our guns dismounted."
2850,3,1212,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,06/09/1692,Fort,RAC,"By this 2 hand canoe have sent my August accompts and for ballance 3-1ta of gold. Here is no trade at present, we hear that their are broills in the country which stops the trade."
2851,3,1213,William Cooper,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,26/09/1692,Fort,RAC,"In humble wise I petition your Honours mutuall consideration for my advancement to the first vacant Factory. For upwards of these two years have I remained a second in this place, much longer then any before me have, and my 3 years contract with the Royall African Company draues neer end, which makes me thus desireous of removeall. May your Honours please to grant this request, I shall ever pray for your Honours health and prosperity."
2852,3,1214,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,10/10/1692,Fort,RAC,"I have herewith sent you my August accompt, wherein I have entred Captain Brabay in liew of Captain Quo. We have no ballance for our September accompt last, nor have we any trade, all this country people being gone to fight the King of Whydah. I have had a verie severe relaps of a feaver, which has weakned me and reduced me to a shadow. Mr Cooper has had the gripes, but now on recovery."
2853,3,1215,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,15/10/1692,Fort,RAC,By this conveyance Mr William Cooper has taken his passage according to your orders.
2854,3,1216,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,09/11/1692,Fort,RAC,"Herewith I send my September & October accompts, and for ballance of the latter 2o 8a 10ta of gold, for the former there is no ballance. I am as sorry as you can be that our trade is so bade, but what is yett worse its like to containow so as
long as the warr holds. I hope you don't impute it a fault in me for I do asure you I had no hand in the warrs, nor shall I have more for makeing peace, for the King of Quamboe is resolved to go through with it. A little patiance may bring great things to pass, but what [blank] me in the meanwhill is that our neighbours to participate in the same misfortune."
2855,3,1217,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,11/12/1692,Fort,RAC,"This goes by Monsieur Gasper Martenan, per whom I have sent my November accompts and for ballance mk3 2oz 15a 5ta gold. Here is little trade, and the Quambores have sent more men to fight Whydah, so that in all likelyhood the warrs will still containow."
2856,3,1218,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,10/01/1693,Fort,RAC,"My last was per Monsieur Martenan the 11th ultimo, per whome I sent my November accompts and for ballance mk3 2oz 15a 5ta gold. This is for conveyance of my December accompts and balance, being mk412a 6ta gold. I suppose you have heard of the disorders at Whydah, and since we are informed that the Quamboers and confederats have taken the King of Whydah prisoner, but that will want a confirmation. However there are no slaves to be bought at Whydah, and therefor the Dutch do designe to slave their great ship with Gold Coast Negroes, and for that purpose they do buy all they can att Accra and elcewhere. If you judge it necissary we may buy some also, for in all probability Negroes will be scarce in all places."
2857,3,1219,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,09/02/1693,Fort,RAC,"By the bearer I have sent my January accompt & for ballance mk3 1o 14a of gold.

[gap in correspondence, mid-Feb. to July 1693]"
2858,3,1220,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,03/08/1693,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys my July accompt and ballance, being six marks six ounces twelve angles and one taccoe of gold, which please to pass to my credit. I have also sent you a bulce containing 3oz 7an of gold, the estate of John Webb deceased. I have sent sundry times to the King of Quamboe about the delivery of the Danes fort, and he has allwayes sent me fair promises, but of late the Dutch second hath been there to solicite for their releasement and to contract for the Castle, he carried great presents with him, and gott the two Danes which were there. The General [i.e. of the Danes] and the rest are yet at the Danes Town, and I have sent also to remember him of his promise and to desire him to come to capitulation about the Castle. When I have his answer shall advise you. I shall gett in 300 chests corne but I cant tell as yett whether or no I may procure any more. Be pleased to lett us have a speedy supply of sheets, brawles & some cases of sperritts as soon as you can, after that the shipps may bring what cant be sent at present."
2859,3,1221,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,09/09/1693,Fort,RAC,"Your sundry letters in August last I received in due time. By the returne of the canoe which brought yours of the 13 June I sent the bell which I charged in my accompts, and since I find the canoe was sent from Winnebah with the said litter [= letter], therefore I judge that the bell is [in] custody of the party that sent it. By Capt. Bradshaw I received the sundry goods sent me as per your letter 21st August, and he made the best of his way to Amersa for shells, for we have none


here. Inclosed you have receipts for the corne &c, and 24 men, 20 women shipped per Capt. Funnell and Capt. Curtis. They would not give me bills of lading for the slaves, therefore was forced to take receipts, one of each I have forwarded according to your orders. Capt. Funnel has taken no corne here, he haveing provisions enough as he told me. The Kinge of Quamboa will not dispose of the Danes fort yet, but himself and [the] Cabbosheer the black Governor of the fort and all the people of the Danes Towne do promise that [it] shall never fall into other hands but the English, and I doe realy believe them, but how long it may be first I doe not know. They have a great trade with Dutch interlopers, which they find so profitable that I doubt they will not easily part with the fort, in a few months we shall see what they resolve upon. If they keep the fort it will be a notable prejudice to our factory. The Kinge of Quamboe sent his cosen some time agoe to deliver me three of the Danes, and the black copeman was comeing to deliver me the Generall and three men more, but approaching the Dutch fort they [= the Dutch] sent at least 30 shott to Wellcome him. He was wounded in the foot, and some of the solders elsewhere, but his men had their revenge also, for they wounded a Dutch soulder in both the thighs and another in the foot as they were managing their guns. This caused a great animosity between them, & the Dutch begin to be affraid of their Towns people. The Generall of the Danes, haveing mist the opportunity of comeing heither, 2 or 3 days after found an opportunity to make his escape and happily gott off to the Dutch fort, which I was glad to hear. The other 3 men I hope will be delivered me ere long. The messenger I sent so long agoe to Whydah is not yett returned, we here there are quarells between Offery and other countryes, which stops the passage both for man and beasts. Inclosed goes my August accompt and ballance, being 3mk 7oz 12an of gold, which please to pass to my creditt. I was in hopes you would have ordered our pautkies white to have been sent to Whydah. They will never sell for 2an, it may be they may sell for one and a halfe, also they may lye and damage. If you can supply us with paper brawles [they] will doe very well."
2860,3,1222,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,02/10/1693,Fort,RAC,"The 9th ultimo per returne of the two hand canoe I sent my August accompt and ballance, and herewith you will receive my September accompt and ballance, being 3mk 4oz 2an 9ta of gold. For very nigh a month there has been great difference between the Kinge of Quamboe & Addo about priviledges, so that they were upon the poynt to decide it by a battle but were interposed by the Cabbosheers, where they are about an accomodation, which I wish may happen, for as long as they are at variance all trade will be prohibited. I desire you to furnish me if possible with paper braules, umbanees & long cloths white for purchasing of slaves, also send us the gun carriages, for we have extreme occasion for them. The Dutch town people do dayly come over to us, & our new Town is now pritty full and will augment dayly. We have no corispondency with the Dutch, they thinke we do to much in protecting the people which come to live with us. The leeward passages, the man I sent to Whydah is not returned yett. Inclosed is a letter which I received from the Generall of the Danes, he complaines he has not necessaryes allowed him from the Dutch, and indeed they treat him more like an Negroe then a Generall. I have excused my selfe to furnish him with anything so long as he is with a pack of rascalls, who abuse us as well as him and his nation, & who by their evill councell have been the cause of his misfortunes, for he confessed they councelled him to quarell with the Negroes, which advise has ruined him, but I have wrot to him that I would send his letter to your perusall, that you might see what would be necessary for him. In 2 or 3 dayes he goes in a Briganteen from here to the Mine."
2861,3,1223,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,14/10/1693,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 6th instant I received. It was an omission in my September accompt, for the 100 Turky carpetts are yett remaining. Of late the Dutch have gott a new Copeman, who is to do mighty matters. The Generall of the Mine has sent sundry blacks to accompany him, who are altogether by a multitude of faire promises of large immunityes & restitution for the damages which they sustained by fire to perswade our new Cabbosheers to returne to the place where they received so great injury, but I hope they labour in vain, and do not doubt to maintain them here, altho the Dutch have offered to advance them 100 bendies over and above their losse by fire. They have now got their new tower built, upon which they designe to place 12 gunns, & [I] hope wee shall receive the gunn carriages per first, and [as] to the goods I wrote for, I desire you to add 40 or 60 fine sletias. We heare that the difference betweene the King and Addo is almost agreed, and then I hope we shall have some trade."
2862,3,1224,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,05/11/1693,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 21st ultimo I received in due time. Herewith goes my October accompt & ballance, being mk5 7oz -a of gold. Our new Cabbosheers have taken fetych to abide with us, which I am glad off, for if they should returne it would make worse for this Factory then if they had never [ms. 'new'] come. I have often solicited the blacks to release the 3 Danes which remaine with them, but I find they wo'not do it upon any termes, for they keep them to write letters aboard interlopers with whom they have a great trade. I cannot sell perpetuanoes for more than 10a, the country is soe much supplyed by the blacks from the Danes Fort at easy rates that they outdoe us, besides the Dutch sell them for 10a. If the brigantine bee not parted, I desire you would bee pleased to send us a good quantity of sheets, for wee expect a trade as soon as Addo has done his new custome, the King and hee haveing reconciled their annimosities."
2863,3,1225,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,15/11/1693,Fort,RAC,"By a Black lately come from Whydah I am informed that Mr Smith, Mr Pearson and another whiteman are dead, which I thought fitt to advise, and also that Doctor Douglass is deceased. The said man tells mee that the shipps sailed from thence aboute 3 weeks agoe. In March 169_ there went from hence in the Allegator Sloop nine paire of long irons, which I desire may bee returned per first opportunity
[PS] The man I sent from hence stays for a letter."
2864,3,1226,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,09/12/1693,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 19th ultimo I received per Capt. Bradshaw, with one hundred eighty umbanees, seventy five gallons rumm, and the gunn carriadges on accompt of the Royall African Company of England. No[n]e of the carriages was big enough for two of our greatest gunns. Our gunner being indisposed, has desired leave to goe to Cabo Corso to consult about his distemper, hee knowes the dementions of the great gunns. Herewith I have sent my November accompt and ballance, being five marks, four angles, nyne taccoes of gold, which please to passe to my credit. By first opportunity I desire you will please to send us some halfe pieces blue long cloths, pautkies blue, and plaines green. I can't sell iron barrs for more then 2a. Wee have now about a hundred slaves, I wish you would send for some, for our prisons are too full.
[PS] Mr Bradshaw will sail on Munday."
2865,3,1227,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,06/01/1694,Fort,RAC,"Herewith you will receive my December accompts and ballance, being mkl 1oz 6a 10ta, which please to passe to my credit. The King of Quamboe is gone 7 or 8 leagues up the country towards Anguinas, what his designe is I do not know. They say the Akims are prepairing for warr, some say against Quamboe, and others against the Arcanyes. If they warr against any country, will put a stop to all trade. I desire you to send us the 9 paire of long irons, for our slaves are very much incommoded for want of them."
2866,3,1228,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,11/01/1694,Fort,RAC,"When Capt. Bradshaw comes, I desire you will bee pleased to send us some wood for the burneing of shells, and also to order the surveyor to come for a day or two, to contrive a convenient spurr to the Fort, which I conceive will strengthen and bee a great ornament to the place."
2867,3,1229,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,16/01/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the twelfth instant with 6 paire of short irons are come to hand. I perceive you are informed that the Quamboers had a designe to surprize us as they did the Danes, for what reason I know not, but must think them very malicious and unreasonable to attempt it, without any provocation. I desire you will be pleased to let mee know who it was that reported it, that I may bee the better able to judge of the probability of such a designe. By myne of the 11th instant, I desired you to send us some wood to burne shells, and also to order the surveyor to come for a day or two to contrive a convenient spurr, which will strengthen the Fort very much. The gunn carriages I shall expect, which will serve us in great steade, in case the French should come upon the Coast.
PS. There are three Portuguezes whose shipp was gone before their arrivall, they haveing a desire to goe to Cabo Corso, have promised to pay the canoe men on arrivall."
2868,3,1230,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,25/02/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of yesterdayes date I received. According to your former advice I shall take all care possible that the blacks doe us noe injury. Wee have but a few men, and I desire you to lett us have a speedy supply, for if they doe us any injury it will bee for want of hands to defend us. John Yoargin I shall send up by the next canoe. The Dutch are well supplyed with men and are resolved to have constantly upwards of thirty souldiers. As for gold wee shall have little or none these two months. There is nothing goes forward now in Quamboe but preparations for warrs. The King has sent a great party already downe to fight to leeward, and most of Accra will follow ere long. As for slaves wee have sixty men and fifty two women. Wee have had diverse deade these two months of the gripes &ca. As soon as possible, I shall send you my January and February accompts. When the briganteen comes, I desire you would [send] us some sheets, perpetuanoes blue, paper brawles, parpetuanoes & Walch plaines green, allejars & tapseills if you have any.
[PS] By one accident of a great gun, which had not been discharged for seaven years before, I have hurt my hand and as yett is not cured."
2869,3,1231,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,03/03/1694,Fort,RAC,"My last to you was of the 25th ultimo. This is to accompany my January & February accompts and the ballance, being mk1l 2oz 9a 7ta gold. If you have occasion for 3 or 400 chests of good corne I can procure it to be shipt by the first oppertunity."
2870,3,1232,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,05/03/1694,Fort,RAC,"The bearer hereof is called Boubee, one of King Ahennisa his sons, his mother is the present Queen of Anguinna. He is lately come from Quamboe with a designe to reccide [= reside] at this place, he desires to be entertained in the Companys service. When the ways are open, I belieive he may be very instrumental to induce a trade, soe leaveing it to your judgement."
2871,3,1233,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,06/03/1694,Fort,RAC,"Sundry of our slaves being lately dead and others falling sick dayly makes me
apt to think that they are too much crowded in their lodging, and besides have not the benefitt of the air, therefore have thought fit to send by the five handed canoe 12 men, and desire you will be pleased to send by returne of the same plains & perpetuanoes green, tapsells and allejars or what you may have of these sorts to make up a leading."
2872,3,1234,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,08/03/1694,Fort,RAC,"I wrot you the 6th instant that I had sent 12 men slaves by the 5 hand canoe, but it seems they returned 4 of them, the canoe being too much loden. Our slaves have gott a disease amongst them which first seizes them in the belly & thence in the stomack, and altho lusty strong slaves kills them immediately. What it is I don't know, but the Blacks say it is a catching disease, therefore I have sent by the 3 hand canoe 6 men, and would send all those who are not attackt if I had canoes to do it. If you please to send some goods by returne of the canoe, that she may not come empty."
2873,3,1235,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,18/03/1694,Fort,RAC,"My last was the 15th instant per the 5 hand canoe, whereby I sent 8 men slaves, and now by this 3 hand canoe I have sent 6 men slaves, and desire you to send by returne of the same as many sheets as she can take."
2874,3,1236,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,04/04/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 17th & 24th ultimo I received in due time. The sundry goods sent last month per the Briganteen & canoes I have inserted in my accompt. When the shipps come downe I desire you to send us a good quantity of sheets, pautkies blue, long cloths blue, half pieces long cloths white, paper brawls & a few English tapsails for a tryal. Pray send us alsoe some deale boards to make cots, windows &ca for Factory use. Herewith you will receive my March accompts and ballance, being mk7 4oz 2a 3ta of gold, which pass to my creditt. We shall get some shells for the Briganteen."
2875,3,1237,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,15/04/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 11th instant is come to hand. According your order I shall purchase 400 chests of corne more, which I doubt not will be ready against the shipps come downe. I shall neglect no oppertunity, for I know it requires expedition. The slaves we buy here are not all Quamboers, but I know they are natives not far from thence, although they speak another lingua, however they doe not cost the Company 4 sterling per head which the Captains are allowed for Whydah Negroes. As soon as the Briganteen has gott the shell on board, which now lay ready, she shall depart, but she cannot take the slaves, being voyd of convenience for that purpose.
[PS] We are building of a spur, for which I desire you to send us a gale steed [= gate stead?] and door per first. We have sent 8 pairs short irons to be mended."
2876,3,1238,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,20/04/1694,Fort,RAC,"By the Briganteen I have shipped forty five butts of shells. Robert Wright our Gunner, being very sick & weak, has desired leave to goe to Cabo Corso, which I have granted him, seeing is not able to officiate. In his roome I have placed Roger Beamont, who is the fittingest man we have for that imploy."
2877,3,1239,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,02/05/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours 19th ultimo I received. As yett the East India Merchant is not arrived. Herewith you will receive my Aprill accompts & ballance, being mk1 6oz 13a 7ta of gold, which please to passe to my creditt. Since the 15th we have had noe trade at all. The Quamboers are threatened by the Akims with fire & sword, and the Black Governor at the Danes Fort has bought a considerable quantity of gunns & powder for the King, out of two Dutch interlopers. Except they buy an accord we shall be utterly destitute of trade, and yett it is to be wished that the Akims may beat them & force a trade through their country, which they greatly desire. Inclosed is a letter of what is wanting in our store, which I desire you will please to supply, and more especially with bandeliers & cartouch boxes, that our men may look like soldiers as our neighbours doe. I am sorry to see two of our best guns ly as they do, if possible I desire you to send two carriages that they may be mounted."
2878,3,1240,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,25/05/1694,Fort,RAC,"The sundry goods you sent per the East India Merchant I have received, and have shipt by her 160 chests of corne, and 200 chests by the Hanniball. The King of Quamboe for more then a months time has suffered noe corne to come downe, soe that I can provide none for the Briganteen. The 12th instant Capt. Shirley deceased, and the 13th was interred in this place. For more than 15 dayes past we have had much violent raines that since the memory of man the like has not been knowne. They have brought downe our [blank] flancker, and most of the other worke looks very suspitious, they are built of nothing but stone & red earth, which cements no more then the sand on the sea shore, but I rebuild,
I am resolved shall be more substantiall, with good mortar. We have but one bricklayer, I desire if you can spare us some, and the surveyors advice would be very necessary. I would have sent up Mr Gilois if the season had permitted but now I have not a canoe, for the East India Merchant having lost her canoe I was forced to spare mine, and shall see to gett another for the factory. I take notice of what you write about the Danes, as yett they have done nothing with the Blacks. Ere long I shall write more about that matter, and of the debts due from Yorgen. Have lost 2 of our new men, and diverse others are sick. The raines still continue."
2879,3,1241,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,31/05/1694,Fort,RAC,"By the 5 hand canoe goes Mr Gilois. Bad weather has detaind him sundry dayes. Our South East flanker is sunk very much, and the wall on the inside is broke downe, all which must be repared first, for our great gunns are upon it. Three of the Dutch flankers are fallen, and the other if it dont fall must be pulled downe. I desire you will send us some cases of spiritts."
2880,3,1242,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,06/06/1694,Fort,RAC,"My last was the 31 May, when Mr Gilois was ready to parte, but the weather haveing been extreame bad he has not been able untill this day, since which time the raines have washed downe our North West flanker and the souldiers houses under the west curtaine walls, soe that now we have vast things in hand and but one black bricklayer. How we shall goe through I cannot well conceive. I beleive we shall have some of the other worke downe ere long.
PS. We have now noe lodging for our women slaves."
2881,3,1243,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,20/06/1694,Fort,RAC,"My last was of the 6th instant per Mr Gilois, to which referr you, since which the [blank] of our tower has been like to fall, but we hope to secure it for this season. The Danes have gott their Fort, paying one hundred & twenty bendys for the same. Herewith you will receive my May accompts & ballance, being 5 ounces 10 angles gold. Att present I am very indisposed and have gott a weakness in my hands in soe much that I am not able to help myself. We are like to have no trade. We hear that the AQuamboers are going to fight to the leeward.
[PS] This was designed the 16th instant, but bad weather forced the canoe back againe.
[PPS] I have just now received yours of the 17th instant, with the bad news of the loss of Succondee Fort & the misfortune arrived to Mr Johnson and diverse other white men. Here is a Dutch interloper in the road, who I suppose may saile tomorrow, per whome I shall not faile to give notice of this misfortune to the Royall Company. Wee shall take what possible care wee can to secure ourselves here, being not in any ill circumstances with the Negroes."
2882,3,1244,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,21/06/1694,Fort,RAC,"My last was of yesterdays date, wherein I advised of a Dutch interloper that lay in this road, by whom I designed to write to the Royall Company, but he went off in the night, soe that I have not made use of that opportunity. I desire you'ld send me the iron worke by the returne of the canoe."
2883,3,1245,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,05/07/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 25th ultimo with the ironworke we received. I am very sorry to understand of your indisposition, I pray God you may recover your health. This accompanyes my June accompts & ballance, being 3 marke two angles 8 taccoes & one damboy gold, which please pass to my creditt. We are makeing what hast we can to rebuild our flankers &c. The wood to burne shells will cost us somewhat dear. I desire soe soon as you can to supply us with sheets, Welsh plaines blue, powder & cases of spiritts. Of the last twenty plaines that was sent fourteen were damaged. Pray what you send lett them be good, for we have a great many damaged. If you want a ladeing of shells for the Briganteen, they ly reddy, but have noe canoe to carry them off. Inclosed is a letter from the Dane touching John Yoargen's debt, to which referr you. The man that wrote the letter abuses the English nation in generall very much, and that because the King of Quamboe told him that the English would give a great kettle full of gold for their Fort."
2884,3,1246,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,17/07/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 10th & 13th July I have received, & the note you inclosed upon the late Generall of the Danes, I shall demand & lett you have their answer. By the 11 hand canoe we have received twenty five chests of sheets & four barrells of gunpowder, which I shall keep for Fort use, for the Blacks have supply enough from Dutch interlopers. I am informed the Quamboers want another plunder; we shall take what care we can to secure our selves. The Blacks overawe the Danes severely and alreddy don't fear to say that they'l be revenged of them when the ships are gone for some penurious actions they have done the Cabbosheers which went with them to Quamboe about the recovery of their Fort. John Britlover [= Brithower], one of our men, layes stone very well and can doe as much worke as two Blacks. For some consideration per month he is willing to worke, and indeed furthers the work extraordinarily, I am glad we have such a man."
2885,3,1247,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,02/08/1694,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys my July accompts & ballance, mk2 15a 7ta of gold. The Akims have been at Quamboe these 15 dayes with good store of gold, but the King won't suffer them to buy anything, untill they have taken a fetish to be true to Quamboe, but they being only traders it seems can't doe it, that being a matter of great concernement, and the prerogative power being in their King & Cabbosheers. I am afraid it will never be well soe long as the old man reigns att Quamboe, for he has continually new projects in his head, he has stopt the way soe that wee have neither corne nor other provisions. We have secured our north west flancker and have begun our north east, which will be very substantiall, eight foot thick & five thereof with limes, but wee shall be a long time to finish all, haveing a vast work in hand. The Dutch make their flanckers all with solid stone. Our south west flanker, under which is our prison for men, I thinck won't stand long, however it must be new laid with coconutt. When you have an opportunity I desire you to send us some brick, & forelocks &ca to keep our guns firm in their carriages, for when we fire 'em they leap out and break our flankers."
2886,3,1248,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,28/08/1694,Fort,RAC,"By yours of the 21th [var. '11th'] instant I perceive the arrival of Capt. Piles & Capt. Buttram to windward. What slaves present I shall endeavour to procure, but they are not very plenty. Inclosed you will receive the accompts of whats due from the Danes, who will pay nothing but ill words. Ere long wee shall want bricks, alsoe forelocks formerly wrott for, and nailes, and we are extreemly in want of a long ladder to mend our tower, which is very faulty in [s]undry places. The Quambores & Akins are not yett agreed, but they say there are hopes of an accomodation ere long. The Blacks are very tedious in their resolutions, I wish it may prove well in the end."
2887,3,1249,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,04/09/1694,Fort,RAC,"My last was the 28th ultimo. Herewith I have sent my August accompts and ballance, being mks2 1oz 15a 3ta, which please to place to my creditt. The King of Quamboe & the Akins can't agree, and therefore the Akins are gone home. If you have any umbanees, paper brawles, long cloth white & blue, allejeires, spiritts & sheets I desire you will please to furnish us per first, for if any slaves to be had wee shall have occasion of such goods. I can purchase some com, if you have occasion please to advise."
2888,3,1250,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,08/09/1694,Fort,RAC,"This day Capt. Bradshaw is come ashore extreemly sick of a feaver. He desires me to acquaint you that he can't take charge of your vessell, therefore desires you to send downe a man for that purpose."
2889,3,1251,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,15/09/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 12th instant I received per Capt. Pepperell, and accordingly he tooke possession of the Briganteen, Capt. Bradshaw being deceased the 10th instant, and the morning he sayled to leeward. Inclosed is his receipt for the goods. By the 11 hand canoe have received seaventeen chest containing 1105 sheets, fifty half long clothes blue, forty umbanees & fifty three pautkies white on accompt of the Royall African Company of England. I desire you to send us some irons, all we have are in use. Capt. Buttram had 9 long paire of irons the last voyage, which were upon the slaves which went from hence in the sloop, if we can have them they will be very serviceable to the Factory. Edward Barter has sent some cows & bulls, the canoe men have taken 11 bulls. Here are some cows larger, which they would not take. They say Edward Barter will be here tomorrow. Our bricklayer wants tools according to the inclosed."
2890,3,1252,John Rootsey,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,05/10/1694,Fort,RAC,"I thought fitt to acquainte you of my being heare, and have inventored both Forts. I waite now onely for the convenient opportunity to returne. Wee heare that Capt. Pepperell hath near quite his complement of slaves, and that the Blackes have keept a great many slaves for Capt. Piles against his comeing downe, soe it may be supposed as she will be upp as soon as Capt. Pepperell, considering his saileing. I am well in health, and my goute leggs are much better. Ile trouble you no further at present."
2891,3,1253,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,05/10/1694,Fort,RAC,"Hearewith I have sent my September accompts & ballance, m8 00oz 10a 00ta in gold, which please to pawne [= pass] to my accompts as creditt. By first opportunity I desier you to send us some sheets, blew plaines, correll, reed and blew cloths for Cabbosheers. Mr Rootsey tell us that the tooles which were designed for us were putt on shoore att Winnebah, which is an ill bussiness, for wee are in wante of them."
2892,3,1254,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,20/10/1694,Fort,RAC,"By Mr John Rootsey you will receive the inventory of this Factory, which you will find agreeable to the ballance of my September accompts, it being takein per month instant."
2893,3,1255,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,22/10/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 16th & 19th instant I received in dew time. By the former I perceive my mistake in the amount of the perpetuanoes, which I have corrected, and heareby sent you 10oz to satisfye the same. By the 11 hand cannoe wee have received 2621/4; ounces of correll & 14 cheast of sheets containing 910. I have returned one cheast of damaged sheets which are not vendeable. By this conveniance have sent 6 cows & 2 bulls which remained of them that Edward Barter formerly sent from Allampo, and at the foot hereof the charges I have paid about them. Mr Rootsey sailed from hence in the Brigganteene the 20th instant, per whom you will receive the inventory of this Factory.

2894,3,1256,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,02/11/1694,Fort,RAC,"Before yours came to hand Capt. Piles was gon to windward. By this convenience I have sent my October accompts and ballance, being mk8: 2: 7: 6ta of gold, which please to pass to my creditt. Pray lett the vessell you send for our slaves be provided with water, and I desier you to send by her sheets and green perpetuanoes.
Three of our flankers being sufficently strong, wee now designe to strengthen our South West flanker by joyning a substantill wall of 4 or 5 foot thick, which wall will be a great security to the mens prison which is under itt. The old flankers where built withowt any foundatyon, and itt is a very easie thing for the slaves to breake their prison. Wee want six great maules to break stones, tar and a tarpowling [= tarpaulin] for factory use."
2895,3,1257,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,11/11/1694,Fort,RAC,"By the Guiney Galley I recevied one hundred and fivety perpetuanoes green, seven hundred and fivetenn sheets.

Wee never received any tooles from Whinneboh more then 6 trowels, 3 hammers & 2 brickaxes, and lines pines, which Capt. Piles left there the other voodge [= voyage] when he whent to leeward.

I suppose wee shall have a speedy saile of our goods, of our perpetuanoes, there[fore] I desier you to supply this per first, and alsoe plaines green, umbanees, iron barrs and one pound basons."
2905,3,1267,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,30/01/1695,Fort,RAC,"Capt. Robinson would not take our slaves except I would lett him have two men for one woman, which I would not allow.

2909,3,1271,John Bloome,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,15/02/1695,Fort,RAC,"By the Guiney Galley I received 500 iron barrs. The forty sayes you sent by her [ms. 'hear] prove much damaged, therfore I have returned them. I have shipt by said vessell forty eight but shells."

Shall be deligent in the manageing of their Royal Company concerns."
2911,3,1273,John Brown,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,23/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"This serves to advise that at present have but few sheets remaining that are good, as also that perpetuanoes & long cloath blue are much caled for, therfore if you have gott any please to send per the first. I thought fitt likwise to advise you that the needfull repairations of this fort will be finished in a few days. Least therfore you might have occasion elswhere to imploy Daniell Wright bricklayer, shall make use of the first opportenity of sending him to Cabo Corso. There is one Christian Malchais that came from on board a Dutch interloper lying in this road, he has been formerly in the Dutch Companys service, has got his discharge, and is now willing to be entertained as a soldjer in the Royall Company fort here, which have presumed to grant till further order. I have inclosed sent you an accompt of what is wanting in the Gunners store."
2912,3,1274,John Brown,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,30/03/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 25th instant with the shotts & guners stores therein mentioned I have received by the Guiney Galley, Capt. Piles, whom have returned you loaden with fifty butts shells, haveing lickwise sent you Mr John Pinck, & Daniell Wright the bricklayer to attend your orders.
[PS] From on board of Capt. Piles did likwise receive John Brithauer Soldier."

Please by the next to send some sheets & pewter juggs if any upon the accompt of the Royall Company."
2916,3,1278,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,27/04/1695,Fort,RAC,"This goes per Capt. Piles. I have according to your order taken charge of the Royall Company concerns in this place. The inventorys will be delivered you by Mr John Browne, who will be with you in few days. I desire on accompt of the Royall African Company of England fivety chests sheets, two or 3 cases good sayes, ten barrells powder for the forts use, here being only three & a half barrells remaining, also some screw'd juggs, & twelve bolts for the soldiers use. You have all the shells per the Galley, only a few which will be used for our use here.
PS. I desire a small cask of tarras for to mend the tanck per first before the raines."
2917,3,1279,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,01/05/1695,Fort,RAC,"This is to desire the goods wrote for the 27th Aprill as soon as possible, also some firelock musketts for the forts use. here is not every man a good muskett, and some nailes & small hooks & hinges for windowes, alsoe one pair charge [= hinges?] for a door."
2918,3,1280,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,12/05/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 6th instant with five hundred & twenty sheets have received, & desire the other with the rest of the goods desired as soone as opportunity of weather presents. Corne here is no probability of getting any, hardly [even] for the use of this place. I have sent three messengers to the king of Quamboe, but have as yett gott noe corne from thence, the way being stoped before I came hither, & as he sends me word is because of the Dutch sending corne in their Briganteene to the Mina. I have now a messenger there, & hope to have go[o]d news at his returne. I doubt shall be forced to exced 2a per chest, & at noe rate gett any more than what will be expended here, till the new corne comes in, notwithstanding my endeavours shall not be wanting. Passed by this road a ship of vast great burthen with English collours, & in her company a Briganteen with Dutch collours, which I beleive was the Dutch briganteene that took corne here & bound to the Mina. I hear since the great one was a French ship.
PS. I desire the iron worck wrote for, with some barr hoocks & small staples for wind[o]wes, here being not one that is good in all the fort. Here is a fresh leak broak in our tanck, that it holds but 3 foot water, therfore desire the tarras may not be forgott, this canoe may bring it."
2919,3,1281,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,05/06/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 3d instant have received with what sent in her, only the sheets want three in every chest, & the last sent seven chests wanted each four, which is more then I have ever heard before. Some of them where ingeniously packed, so that it could not easily be perceived, others were perfectly taken of the top without any repacking. The canoe men all saw these opened this day. Three chests where verry fair, one had three taken of the top ranck. so that for the future I desire the chests may be opened at Cabo Corso, & where it seems hollow, tho' never so well a top, they may be examined, for I belive it is rogury aboard the ships, & doubtless you have more of the same. The pewter you mention to be 1 lb are 3 lb basons. The white longcloths are all di[s]posed of, if any I desire two cases. The certificates for the sheets goes here inclosed. You should have had my accompts before this time but am not able to write them if I might gaine the world, being brought exceding low with feavor, flux & gripes, of which am afraid shall never recover. Trade is verry dull here at present, what we have is only from the Quamboers them selves. They say the Accims will certainly fight them & not make up the difference, which will stop trade here if soe.
PS. I have return'd four of the musketts you sent, the serjant telling me they are good for nothing, two the springs broake & two will make noe fire. Desier four per next."
2920,3,1282,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,09/06/1695,Fort,RAC,"This is to desire on accompt of the Royall Company a good quantity knives, some brass diglins & small brass panns if any, also some white long cloths, to be sent as soon as possible. By this canoe have sent Samuell Moore, who has been lame a long time, & our doctor haveing spent all the medicines he can suply himself with, am forc'd to grant him leave to goe up, or he must perish here, soe desire per returne of the canoe another man in his roome."
2921,3,1283,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,20/06/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 17 by 11 hand canoe with the goods sent by her have received, & by returne of her have sent three of our Arda men slaves, & desire three in exchange of them. Mr Bloome gott four of them from the bleaks [= blacks], they are Beneen slaves, they came ashore here with a great canoe from some ship, so I putt them to work, & last weak one of them run away, and the Serjeant told me that the other Ardas told him that these intended to run after him. therfore to preventt that I have sent them you. for if they run to Quamboe it is hard getting them. As yet there is noe news of him that is gone, but shall endeavour to gett him if possible. I desire those you send may not be Allampo's. On opening the sayes formerly sent found one short, as per the inclosed certificate. If you can spare any powder pray send twenty barrells in halves, I have been often sent to by the Cabbosheers of Quamboe for some."
2922,3,1284,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,07/07/1695,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys my accompts for May & June, with i[t]s ballance. being three marques, seven ounces, one angle & seven taccoes. Alsoe a certificate left me by Mr Browne, by which the ground rent of the pleace apears to be paid to the first of August next. The King of Quamboes man Affomadoe has been here, & demands five month ground rent, four being due at Mr Bloomes departure from hence. I could give him no other answer then what this certificate derected, only telling him I would advise you of it, & if any thing was due to the King it should be paid. He went away contented with that answer, but as soon as he arrived at Aquamboe, came messengers sent by the King to stop all trade or provitions from us, saying that I was come to cheat him, and I should have no trade before he had his money, but I agreed with the fellowes that they should not put their fetish up, hearing [ms. 'hareing'] how chargeable it had been in Mr Whitings time, till I had sent to Quamboe. The Kings answer was that I cheated him. and that he would make noe pallaver unless I came my selfe, soe was forced to returne the messenger again with a dashee of a broad sattin & a case of spirrits. They bring me word he is contented with till this canoe return, but I am certaine he will be paid it againe, tho' without doubt Mr Bloome has already paid him, but doe believe is cheated by his servant Affoemadoe, who I have already found a great rouge. Mr Browne can tell you the most of this of any body. Pray consider what you will doe in it. I have used all the arguments I can. but he is fully directed by his messenger, & to be sure now Mr Bloome is absent they will never owne the payment. I desire on accompt of the Royall Company a good quantity of sheets, one caske or more of knives, if you have them. The King of Quamboe sent me word I should take care w[h]at I did, for he could take our fort when he pleased, that I might see how he served the Deans. I wish wee had a spurr before our gate, being verry open too the negroes. Here is a verry good gate, for it, & I have stone broake & belive the shells will make lime enough to build it. & presume at present for want of lime you have little to doe for your bricklayers, if you please to send two or three hither with what is here already may raise a spurr in a verry short time, which will be great safeguard to us against the blacks, & as soone as done they may returne"
2923,3,1285,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,24/07/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 13d instant have received. Captain Quo & Braboe has been at Quamboe, who both accompanys this. The King if you require it is contented to loose the four bendyes he says due before Mr Bloome departure & that I pay him from the time Mr Bloome left this place. Quo carried him as from you a case of spirrits, a sattin & a longee, & Adoe a case spirrits, and about 2 days since he sent to me for two iron barrs to rowsaw, which I sent, supposeing it customary or he would not have sent to me for them.
Mr Cooper cannot spare his bricklayers. Beseides blaks I have here. I want white[s], & they shall returne in a short time, that it may be done as



it should be. Besides I want the tower to be surveyed, that we may contrive if possible to secure it before the latter rayns, for if it falls you have not men to build it at present, & here is no other place for the Companys effects or a Cheif to be in, & if secured it may stand for of [= aught] I knows three or four years more, but I desire not your bricklayers to stay any longer then raiseing the spurr and directing the bleaks here how to secure the tower, which I will se shall be done after they are gone. I desire Thomas Howard may be one of them you send. The walls al[l] round the fort are of a good thickness, only that which is next the towne, which is not above a foot & a half thick and build with swish, which I designe if you thinck convenient after the spurr is built, to make two foott thicker of good stuff, it laying just open to the Dutch fort. I believe Polonia [= Poland] linnen may sell here, the Dutch sell a sort of sletias much like it, if you plaese to send a case, if they goe of shall send for more, and pray load the canoe with bricks to turne the arch over the spur [ms. 'spurg'] gate. Lime I have not any burnt. If you will have any shells gott here more than for use of the fort, now is the season, and when I have your order, will employ the free people to gett what quantity you will have. I can heare nothing of the blak taylor. The mallato is willing to serve for soldiers pay, he is as I hear as good carpenter, & when any thing is be done here he will worke. He has served at the Dutch fort many years, & have now gott discharge from the Generall of the Mina. The Dutch Copeman give a good caracter of him, so I believe he may deserve the pay of a soldier, if you thinck convenient.
PS. We have not any saws in the fort. I desire by this canoe a hand saw. The certificate goes here inclosed."
2924,3,1286,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,10/08/1695,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys my July accompts & ballance, being mk9 4oz 9a 8t good gold. I expect the king of Aquamboe[s] man here a Tuesday, & then shall pay him from ultimo February, which I hope will end all disputes. Sayes I believe if you ordered them to be sold at 14a, would vend here, the Dutch sell att 1oz 2a, and their says are vallued above a peez better then ours. Here is the half of the two cases sent me lost for bad collours, which if they were cheaper may sell, otherwise will lay & damage, here [being] a great quantity already. I desire with the sletias two cases says on accompt of the Royall African Company of England, also brass pans, twenty narrow satins, fifty charcolees & fifty pintadoes broad if you have any, as soon as possible, alsoe three slaves in the roome of them sent you, which we cannot shift without, wanting them to look after our iron slaves, & doe the work of the fort. Corne has been verry dear here, the English interloper give 4a per chest for all the corne he could gett, but now is turned to windward, I hope to bring them to 2a per chest shortly. The Dutch are ordered to buy all the corne & slaves they can gett. I desire the necessarys at the foot hereof."
2925,3,1287,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,19/08/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 15th instant per the 11 hand canoe with the goods sent by her I have received. The sletias are much of a sort, the best or worst will never yeild above 6a, and the chints no more then 5a at this place. I have paid the King of Aquamboe five bendys ground rent from ultimo February."
2926,3,1288,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,12/09/1695,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys my August accompt. The canoe has been of this four nights, by w[h]ich I had sent the ballance, but the weather proveing bad, that she could not goe, & the breese still continuing strong, have kept it till another opportunity. I desire on accompt of the Royall African Company of England sixty sayes, & that the cases may be opened & the [w]rappers ripped to see they are not damaged, & that they are of good collers, for here is many of these last sent that are much damaged and bad collers. The people all hereabout are goeing to wars to leaward of the River Vulter, and here is Ashamannee and all our Cabbosheers are verry earnest with me to supply them with a little powder. If you can possible spare any I desire that I may have ten barrells, and I will keep as much of it for the use of the fort as I can. The Akims threaten the Quamboers again, which I fear will put a stop to trade in these parts. Pray send the ironworck formerly desired, also some slaves irons, long or short.
PS. The English interloper Capt. Sherrings slaves rise & has kill'd his doctor, boatswine & 2 men more, & of the slaves were killed about 100 before they could make them yeild, they takeing an opportunity when the boate was ashore awatering, was like to have had the ship to them selves, the same day he left this coast."
2927,3,1289,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,24/09/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 20th instant with the sayes sent by the 11 hand canoe have received, also the ironworke. In takeing the baile[s] out of the case today I perceived att one side of a baile to be rotted by salt water, also another [in] opening some to sell, not one free from the worme, both w[h]ich I have by the canoe returned, not haveing any body here to judge of the damage, and so many damaged here already. The case I opened could not put them all in again, but have sent three in [w]rapper. I hope the others may prove good. The spurr is almost finished. The briklayers have been sick. We must do something to the tower or it cannot stand. I will sent your briklayers up by next opportunity, & from Mr Cooper I had not any. The Arcims have panyard a great quantity of goods and traders and some are killed, which hath put a stop to trade here, and I doubt it will not be good any more till they have fought. Capt. Laurensa de Souza, a Portuguez, brought a man hither which he sayd was indepted at St Thoma, that he dares not returne, who was desirous to serve the Royall Company at this place, and he [= de Souza] giveing me his word that he knows him to be an honest man, I have entertained him from pay day last. I have sent all the broaken mauls, pickaxes, wedges &ca, an [ms. 'on'] accompt of which is inclosed, and we are in great want of new in their rooms, not having any left, I desire they may be made out of hand, & 3 slaves in the roome of them sent you, these here not being able to do the work of the fort.


PS. 9 mauls
24 wedges
5 pickaxes
1 axe
1 crow"
2928,3,1290,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,22/10/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 19 instant I have received with the powder &ca sent per the 5 hand canoe. I shall doe what I can to satisfie the King of Aquamboe, I expect a messenger this day from him purposely [with] your answer, per next I shall advise you what he says.
PS. I desier the ironwork may be ready by the end of this month which formerly
write for, with two axes, we had but one left. & that was broake about two day
since."
2929,3,1291,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,23/10/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 3d instant by land from Alampo have received. The king of Quemboe never sent a messenger on purpose to me about Mr Coopers boy going up to the Arcims country, but he spoke of it once to me, & I told him it might be that he had sent a boy thither, but if he had, the king might assure him self it was nothing of any palaver concerning him, but that the English was & would continue friends to him, that it must be to encourage traders to his factory, as it was the custome of all whitemen to doe, on which accompt to be sure it was & nothing else. This comes expressly by the king of Quamboe desire to acquaint you that the Arcims are certainly comeing to fight him, and earnestly request you to assist him with fivety barrells pouder, that he doe require no assistance of any else but the English, who alwais stood their friends in all their words. I know he asked some of the Deane, but his answer was if he had a thousand barrells he would not spare him one. Whither the Dutch supply him with any or not I cannot tell, but he mightily pretends he relyes on you. I have advised how scarce powder is on the Coast, he sayes he knows you are never so short but that you have to supply your friends, so what you send for [ms. 'four] him or what answer you send I will give, and keep as fair a correspondence as possible, not giving an opportunity in the l[e]ast to any to do us damage. The Acra's are mightily afraid the Quamboe will come on them before they fight the Arcims. Addoe has been daily expected here, but now I hope he will not come, for Peter Pasop was goeing up to fetch him, and some blacks informed the Dutch Copeman that it was with an intent to surprise their fort, which I believe has put a stop to his comeing. When the people heard of his comeing they were all at me to sell them a barrel] powder, to watch their towne. I putt them off, telling them that when they know he would realy come they should not want powder nor any assistance if he offer'd to molest them, but it was really that I had not in the fort enough to spare any out, therefore I desire that whatever you send for the king of Quamboe that you will send me a good supply for the fort, with 100 lb small shott, for we have few or none, nor any conveniency here to make any, and being at [ms. 'ad'] such a distance if any thing happened cannot presently have supply.
PS. I suppose he designes to give either mony or pawns for his powder. Haveing no trade is the reason I send noe accompts, at the end of this month shall make up all together."
2930,3,1292,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,28/10/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 25th instant I have received, & accordingly gave the Dutch Copeman an invitation hither, which he excused, saying that he was not able, being ill. Whether he have had some notice from the Mine or not of the Generalls intent I know not, but I have not seen him above this two months, & since I have been here wee have had but verry little correspondance together. The Arkims & Aquamboes palavera is now verry hott, they say the Arkims are on their march to Quamboe."
2931,3,1293,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,07/11/1695,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys my accompts for September & October with the ballance, being seven markes three angles & five taccoes, also the ballance of my August accompts, being ten markes four onces fourteen angles and five taccoes good gold, together is seventeen marks four ounces and fourteen angles & seven taccoes. I desiere to know what Doctor Hayes sallary is, & what you allow him for expence of medicines, & from what time his sallary is due, also what his allowance for his diet is, he desireing to be paid. Also I desire white long cloths to make a flagg for the fort, this here being all to pieces, & the iron worck if done.
PS. Inclosed is a petition of John Brethore. I desire axle trees for the gunns per the canoe, what s[h]e can take in."
2932,3,1294,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,07/12/1695,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys my November accompts. I have at present noe trade, want of goods is partly the reason. I know not what to make [of] the Quamboe & Akim palavera. The Quamboes comes now verry little to the waterside downe & is very troublesome to the Accras, in soe much that they are almost ready to leave the place. He putt them to abundance of charge more than was usuall in Ahenesas time, every months or two stops the corne from comeing downe & then must have his demands before they can gett any. The Accras that are to leaward of the River Volta has killed a Cabbosheer called Aucutto, who for some years past has hindred the way by land to Arda, soe now hope to have the leaward way open in a little time. Here is a great stiere [= stir] about him, Addo haveing taken a feteech to him that he should not be molested, therefore threttens to kill all that live here, though is his owne people that assist the Accras & without there help [they] could not have conquered him. I judge the reason of the slaves dying soe fast is chieftly the faughlt of the cankey stones grinding away amongst the corne. I never heard till now that the free people here buy their stones from other places, these being only in a manner sand, therefore desire eight large stones from your parts. If the canoe cannot bring them pray send another with her, & I doubt not but we shall have an alteration, for here is lusty good slaves taken with the gripe [ms. 'guye'] one day & dead the next, others fall dead at once, & noe other reason can I thinck of them than that. Our flagg stafe is broake, if you have ever a peice of old mast or large sparr about tenn foot long to putt to the battune [= batten?] that may still serve, which I desier may likewise be sent, with hoopes & large nails fitt for the worke, also a little canvess for the head of the flagg. If you have any iron I desier your great canoe with her loading. John Burton has left 8 a yeare in England & has not had a letter thence this seaven yeares, therefore humbly beggs [ms. 'baggs'] that you will be pleased to grant him his whole pay here, soe that none may be paid there, which will doe him a great kindness, his pay here being verry small. I cannot have stone ready presently to case a wall of the fort, soe have sent up your other bricklayer, I have paid him to the last pay day."
2933,3,1295,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,15/12/1695,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 12 instant, with two hundred & fifty iron barrs, have received, and
per returne of the canoe have sent two bunches of corrall containing one hundred & six ounces & a half, it being so verry pale it will never sell here, the Dutch haveing a large supply [of] goods come downe by their slave ship soome days since. There is likewise a great quantity of sad collour pautkies which will never yeild a taccoe in these parts, and I beleive may sell in Fanteene. here being no blew and here is blue both at Dutch and Deanes. They are most of the goods, so by next opportunity shall [send] them up. The 10th instant came ashoare here a Portuguez knowne by one which hath served the Company here severall years, and he desireing to be entertained in the Royall Company service [I] have entertained him as a soldier for 3 years.
PS. The inclosed is John Burtons petition."
2934,3,1296,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,06/01/1696,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys my December accompts, as also the black taylor that run from
the Hill, you must secure him, for if he gett into these parts any more he will be kept cleare of me. I panyard all the Eshue Cabbosheers about him and thretned to send some of them to you before they would confess they knew he was in there towne, and after they brought him I gave them more than the usuall custome to content them, that they might not take it ill being panjard, as you will see by my accompts, but here is no other way to deale with the people in these parts that live out off our commands. I shall raise the narrow baf[t]s if I can, but 2a 6ta has been the usuall rate here, soe beleive it will be hard."
2935,3,1297,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,06/02/1696,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 4 instant came to hand last night about nine a clock, just as the canoes came from the Mine were gone out of the bay. About three days agoe came down three, all loaden with shells and says. I detained not your canoe a minuite, but sent her away to Mr Cooper, she having three padlers, with a small note, which doubt not but was with him long before the great canoes could pass Winnebah, soe hope he has seized them. Whether they was our canoes or not I cannot tell, but one hath a broken head much like to your old canoe. I will purchase what slaves offers, men are verry scarce here, but if you can buy men, I can in a short time gett what quantity of women you please, but to buy a man & a woman I shall not get many, so pray lett mee have your orders. I am heartily glad of the arrivall of the Fauconberg, & hope that the report of the negroes that there is come in company with her three shipps more may be true. This is to desire on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England the following goods of what sort you have, vizt five hundred perpetuanoes blue, two hundred ditto green, sheets at least one hundred chests, six cases of knives, fivety narrow sattins, fivety silke longees, fifty cases spirritts, one pound, two pound & three pound pewter basons a good quantity, one pound as many as you can, brass panns, paper brawles, Guinea stuffs, halfe blew long cloths, white long cloths, Dutch ambanees, blew plaines, blew pautkes, small painted carpetts, & corrall, of each a good quantity. The King of Quambo has lately had severall dashees from the Dutch. Now if you please to send a scarlett cloth, a case of spirits and halfe a barrell of powder for each of them, I believe it will be very acceptable, and cause them to encourage trade, for the Dutch supplyed them with powder when they would have had it of you, and gave them liquor, & halfe a barrell each. If you cannot presently supply me with the goods above mentioned, I desire I may have a canoe full for the purchasing of slaves, not haveing vendible goods here, but shall bee heartily glad if you have a small vessell to send down, for it is not above 3 days since the Dutch [received] one hundred chests of sheets, and if I had any, it would much sp[o]yl their trade."
2936,3,1298,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,22/02/1695,Fort,RAC,"This serves only to advise you that what few slaves offers I cannot purchase, not haveing goods in the fort that is wanted here. I desire if you send any vessells with goods that you would order me to send you these slaves, our prison now being very full, & hope when I have more goods shall get more slaves then I thought for. Also I desire a good quantity of slaves irons. If I had white long cloths or blew ditto, would be a great meanes. This day I have discharged John Brithere, & sent him on board the Dutch interloper, & inclosed is the petition of William Coller, who being sick desires to goe home, soe desire you would be pleased to send two men more in their roome, if you discharge them, and more if you can spare them, the fort being the weakest man'd of the three. I desire a cask of terress, our tank has leeked out almost [all] our water, and a caske of tar. Pray lett me have the terris the first."
2937,3,1299,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,03/03/1696,Fort,RAC,"This comes express on accompt of the Royal Company to advise you that the Dutch Copeman per order of the Generall of the Mine has sent to Attabo, your Cabbosheer att Anguinna, four flask of corne brandy, to know of him for what reason he suffers the people to be panyard in his country, & that [if] he will by force make you deliver them, he shall have what he will demand. On Sunday the messenger returned with a boy of the said Attaboies with three potts of palme wine, with two sheep, and brought the following answer, as I am informed [by] Captain Yaboy, who I dare believe, that if he will send six perpetuanoes, two says & two barrells of powder, that the Anguinnas will march to the waterside & force you to deliver them the said people. This I have from severall hands that Attaboes boy is certainly now in the Dutch town, but theres from none but Yabo the answer he brings. The message the Dutchman sent is confirmed by all, and noe doubt of the truth of itt, soe I think itt convenient that you give the Dutchmen immediate advise thereof, that no difference happen betweene you and the negroes till you are better provided, for to be sure they will think of some way to fetch the Mine people to Cabo Corso, and then the Negroes will not think of troubleing you. Last night I heard of [a] dasshee from the Anguinas, and did mistrust somthing to this effect, or [that] the Dutch were incling [= inclining] to settle att Winibah, so went to Yabo [margin: seven a clock at night] & desired him to inform himself of the truth thereof, what [= which] is above, not having furthe[r] to enlarge."
2938,3,1300,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,09/03/1696,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys my accompts for January and February, and is to desire with the goods formerly wrote for, some iron barrs. Also I desire, if you have any locke come over, send me two or three. I have never a one to the spurgate, & the [= that] which is to the inner gate is as good as none. If you have not any come, pray lett your armourer make two large flatt paddlocks for the gates.
PS. I forgott to desire diglings, if you have any send some."
2939,3,1301,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,21/03/1696,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 14th instant per Capt. Browne, with its contents, I have received, only I find broak in the cases of spirits, eight bottles, and not a drop of liquor in them. I am sorry I could not have a larger supply of sheets, which is a commodity that never failes here. Perpetuanoes the Quambores as yett will not come to 11a, but hope will in a day or two. I have sent on board the Fauconberg, on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England, ninety five slaves, vizt fourty four men and fifty one women, all well and lusty. I have kept five men and six women that are sick, which the Captain was unwilling to take. Three women has died this month. So soon as received yours, I ordered a kiln of lime to be burnt, and have sent you seaventeen caske small and large, and likewise have supplyed Capt. Browne to sett up his furnace. If I had more cask you should have had more lime. I shall purchase what slaves offers, which if the negroes report is true will be considerable, the leward people as they say are comeing up with great quantity.
PS. I have likewise sent 715 sad coller pautkies, 480 of them in two cases, as per inventory. I have just now purchased one man slave more, which have sent on board."
2940,3,1302,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,25/03/1696,Fort,RAC,"I wrote you at large per Capt. Abraham Browne of the 21st instant, wherein I mentioned I shipt on board the Fauconberg ninety five slaves, & in a postscript on the backside of my letter, just as the Captain was going, one man more, and since I have sent him by the canoe which carried your letter to Winnibah after him two women and one man, and now by this canoe one man and one woman, which is all I have since purchased, soe that together I have put on board one hundred and one slaves, vizt. forty seven men, & fifty four women.

William Piles, and likewise on accompt of the Royall African Company of England fifty five good lusty slaves, vizt thirty one men and twenty four women. He has his loading of shells. This accompaneys my February and March accompts with the ballance, being ten marks five ounces and four angles and five taccoes gold. One of the men slaves sent is that which run away at my first comeing hither, it cost me an ounce to gett him, as you will see by my accompts, I thought it better to be at the charge then to loose him, was it only for example for the rest. I have now sent the estate of Richard Noakes, being one ounce six angles. I desire by return of this canoa some sheet lead for spouts, and shott for the use of the Fort, and nailes of severall sorts, not haveing one in the Fort, was forced to gett one hundred of Capt. Piles, to use about the canoas. I desire some Guinea stuffs if you have any, and not dearer then 1a 6ta, and I am forced to desire a good Gunner in the roome of him now here, he is such a sottish drunken fellow it is not fitting he should be trusted with the employ. If you have not men to spare send me one and I will send him up. The differences between these two townes are not att an end, and know not but it may be suddenly renewed, and the Dutch have two good Gunners in their Fort, one sent purposely on the pallaver, and I have only a sott, that has been already three times Gunner of the Fort and still displaced for his drunkenness. I desire to know what John Brittoes pay is and from what time he must be paid."
2942,3,1304,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,29/04/1697,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 27 instant by Mr Richard Sheldon and William Young have received. In few days you shall have my April accompts. Inclosed is accompt of what stores is wanting here for the Gunner. If my canoa is not come away believe she may bring them well enough, leaving the chest sheet lead to be put on board Capt. Piles or Pepperell when they come down."

PS. I also desire some iron and screwed juggs if any."
2945,3,1307,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,22/06/1697,Fort,RAC,"This serves onely to inclose a letter I just received from Capt. Piles from leward. I desire with the goods wrote for in my last, one hundred white blanketts, some Pelonia linnen and three or four bunches of currall, if you have any thatt is good redd, whatt was here I have sold this month.

Desire canvas to make two cotts for forts use."
2947,3,1309,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,19/07/1697,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 15th instant is just come to hand. You order me to put what slaves I have on board the vessell, which is not in a condition to receive them, nor can they conveniently take the half of what I have here, being near seventy, and I fear if I put them on board they will be spoyled, it being the fogg times, that there is noe land breeses. She will be a great while a comeing up, soe
think it better if you please that Captaine Piles in his returne doe call and take them. I had a letter from him two days since, he is very ill. He wrote me he had ninety odd slaves, & beleved he might stay till latter end of August before as many more, therefore presume he will not want roome enough for them. I shall weight your answer and doe as you shall order, and endeavour to gett all good slaves I cann. William Young Gunner desceased 15th instant, I want another in his roome. I desire per first shipp a supply of sheett, plaines and pewter, if you have blew, it being what is demanded here both for slaves and gold. Mr Sheldon hopes you will allow him for the time he hath been here the usuall sallary [a] second useth to have here.
PS. I have this day discharged the Portugueze and sent him on board a briga[n]teen in the road. We are hardly ever cleare of Portugueze vessels, which much hinders Capt. Piles & myselfe from getting slaves.
Capt. Pinson desire me to acquaint you that one of his men is ashoare here sick and beleves he will dye."

This comes express for slaves irons, not haveing a piece in the Castle but what is in use. I have a hundred good slaves, and if may trust to blacks promiss expect considerable more. My sheets is all gone and says what is good is allmost gone, so have not anything that will goe for slaves, perpetuanoes being not in demand where they trade, and the dullest comodity here at present. I desire some small supply speedily, and when the shipps come for Whidah what you please of blew plaines, sheetts, pewter bason & juggs & says, if any good. If you have not irons mad[e] presume the Fauconburg have for her voyage, soe if you send off them they will goe from hence againe with the slaves, for I must keep what men I buy out of irons till returne of the canoe.

Pepperell, seeming to be surprized at yours to Mr Searle, in which you mentioned his departure, so I proceed the voyage according to your orders, but when I came to receive my money of Mr Searle I was startled to find I was to receive only 6 months 6 days sallary at 40 per annum, without any allowance of medicine money or dyett, when I layed out two ounces for medicines which still are to be used in the Companyes service, att leas[t] 3 ounces in the time of my sickness, which thing when you have considered I hope you will make allowance for.

William Piles, who sailed hence the 19th instant in the morning, one hundred and [twenty] two good lusty young slaves, vizt. sixty one men sixty one women, on accompt of the Royall African Company of England. I have not one left. The woman dead in my accompts is the woman left sick when [I] sent you slaves formerly. Of these none have dyed, and think all went well aboard. At present here is not any offers. If the traiders returnes in time I will gett all I possible can to forward the Fauconberg and Sally
Rose dispatch. If you please to advise how long you think they will stay, what I do gett will send by that time, if you order me so to doe. This accompanyes my July accompts. What traders have been of late is for slaves, the Arkinns and Quamboes still being at difference. The Dean hath so much corne brandy that spiritts will not sell [ms. 'seele'] here for above 4a. I desire to know what [is] the mans pay that was left heer out of the sloop, he wanting something to buy provitions.
PS. Just now offered two [ms. 'two' ] good women, which have sent per this canoe, and have ordered them if they meett with Capt. Piles to put them aboard him.

2954,3,1316,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,05/11/1697,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 27th past I received. I will use all the means I can to get slaves. Want of good[s] suteable is a great hinderance. I sent severall messengers to Quambo, which are returned, and give me some hopes, but am not sure till I have received them. I have ten already. If the Sally Rose stayes, maybe [in] twenty dayes hope may get a quantity. At the returne of this canoe, with which goes my September and October accompts, please to advise in what time I shall send them up, or whither you will send for them, if you send for them please to send some powder, for forts use. The difference between the Kings of Quamboe will I believe in few dayes be made up, but believe the Dutch settleing at Poney will againe renew it, for Bonishee says he will turne them out, which I shall be very glad off, for it will be a great hinderance to this place if they remaine there. Now there is a new talk of the Aikims comeing on the Quamboes, and till they once fight, or clearly make up all palavers, here will be but small trade. I omited to advise you that James Mason made a will, and left his estate in the hands of William Sessons.
Of the sayes I have disposed of since my being here, I have had at least five hundred turned by reason of the wormholes. I have had it done by two Blacks, for which I promised them payment, and I thinck if you please to alow them they deserve a damaged saye each. I put on board the Sally Rose the 24th October 12 men and 13 women slaves on accompt of the Royall Company. She did not anchor, or I should have wrote you by Capt. Piles.
PS. Wee are in want of _ hour, hourr and two hours glasses to keep the hours of the day."
2955,3,1317,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,24/11/1697,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 10th instant with two barrells gunpowder and an hour glass have received. I have used all the indeavours possible to purchase slaves. Shipps follows so fast one affter another that the Alampores brings not one up, I have not had a slave from thence this six months. Adoe of Quamboe with all his towne is gone to fight Accrippoone, which likewise hinders. I have thirty odd, presume you will send your great canoe for them, by which time hope may have fifty. What perpetuanoes I barter am forced to let goe at 10a blue, and 9a green, and if I must not sell them so for gold, shall not take money to defray factory charges. I have sett the negroes to gett oyster shells.
I desire by the great canoe a good flagstaff, block and halliards. The 19th instant at night happened here a very great turnado, with which was violent thundering and lightening. It broke our flaggstaff all in pieces, and indangered the whole fort by a clapp that broke in at the topp of the tower downe into the little gold roome, where was but a foot wall between it and the powder. It carryed such violent fire with it that it melted me two pewter dishes alone as if they had been put over a flame of fire, and God be praised done me no further damage. I desire likewise bunting for a flagg, this being all in peices."
2956,3,1318,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,07/12/1697,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 3d instant by Mr Lancelott Anderson have received, with one hundred gallons rumme on accompt of the Royall Company. The canoe brought no flagstaff. Wee are in want of as much plank as will make six gunn carryages, large, and a cask of tarr if you have any. Desire it may be sent with the flagg staff. The goods you advised were the Braffoes had been delivered long since, but the wayes are so stoped that as much as a boy cannot pass Bonishees Towne that belongs to Adoes, which is the reason that nobody has been to desire them, they belonging to Adoes Towns people. The first messenger that demands them, I assure you shall have them. I only take them to keep the Blacks in subjection, that they should not make a common practice landing goods just under our walls. I took them one morning, being upon the flanker, [they] came just before me, therefore could not well lett them pass. By the 15 and 13 hand canoe have sent on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England 13 men and 14 women slaves, which was putt ashore by
Capt. Piles. One of the men dyed the next day affter the sloop sailed hence. Also have sent fifty slaves that I have purchased (vizt) twenty four, men 24 women, one boy and one girle, which is all I could possibly gett, for which as I wrote you in my last have bartered perpetuanoes at 10a and 9 angles, which if you doe not alow of must stand to the loss my selfe. I will dispose of none for gold, till you order it."
2957,3,1319,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,10/12/1697,Fort,RAC,"Having this opportunity by a canoe bound for your parts, desire you will please to send me on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England some iron barrs, perpetuanoes blue, and powder, for forts use, with which please to send the flagg staff I desired in mine the 7th instant."

The Chiefe tells me that all except three or four, which resolves home, will serve the Royall Company, if you please to entertaine them, amongst which are two bricklayers, one of them as good a workman I beleive as any in Guinea, by what I have seen my selfe. The Dutch Coapman has offered him 12a per month. Likewise there is to dispose of thirty six timber peices of nineteen feet long, nine inches broad, and seaven inches thick, with two girders longer and thicker, presumeing those things may be wanted to forward your buildings may be sent, that before I sett forward for Cabo Corso, I may gett them hither, least the shipps come in my absence, and then the Chiefe may not have liberty to dispose of them. There is likewise six gunns now aboard the shipp, four six pounders, two four pounders in the shipps hole, to be sould. The Chiefe sayes if you have occation for them, he will order them to be sold you at the shipps returne, shee being to make a windward voyage.

2960,3,1322,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,21/12/1697,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 19th instant have received. Accordingly have bought from the Deane forty two pieces timber at 4a each. The gunns you may depend on. The shipp sayled from our parts this morning. The men cannot leave the fort till the arrivall of shipping, and then doe presume there is twelve will serve the Royall Company. Them and their things I can send up, when they come. The Chiefe does not know but he may deliver the slaves to the other Company, if not shall have them. I have loaded the sloop with shells, and this night she will saile hence.
PS. James Steward souldier deceased the 16th instant.
There is not any thing more to be disposed of that will be serviceable to you, only three peices of plank for gunn carriages, about 50 foot long, for which they demand 2oz 8a. Doe not know the worth of it, therefore shall waight your orders. It is much wanted in this fort."
2961,3,1323,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,24/01/1698,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 21st instant by the Cabo Corso Gaily have received, also the goods mentioned therein, and have returned her loading with shells.

The 9th instant deceased John Newell serjeant, he made a verball will before severall of our people, and left what he has here in Guinea to Mr Richard Sheldon. The 8th instant deseased Roger Beaumont Gunner, he made no will. Next pay day you shall have his estate, with James Howard. I know you are in great want of men, but loosing these two know not what shall doe without others in their roomes. At present have given the charge of this guard to John Burton, who shall make Serjeant if you please, and if he does not mind his business [I] may change him, when you have a fresh supply of men, but a Gunner I desire you will send downe as soone as this comes to hands."
2962,3,1324,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,09/02/1698,Fort,RAC,This accompanyes my accompts from ultimo October to ultimo January. Here is no manner of trade either for gold or slaves. I have bought the plank of the Deane for loz 8a.

Charles Cotterrell Commander, with bill of ladeing inclosed for sundry goods, amounting to 545 16s 3d sterling as by invoice, consined to my selfe for the accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England, and for what you ordered me in your letter shall observe with carefulness, hopeing to act those things, when come there to Whidah, as may conduce (as much as in me lyes) to the Royall Companyes intrest, most humbly desireing that you would be pleased to try the experiment of sending one small shipp downe there for slaves, wholy consigneing her to me, giveing me timely notice, and likewise to write to the Company, and acquaint them of the necessity of oblidging the Commanders to comply with the charter partyes.
I believe there is an error commited in the brass, for I suppose one cask cannot containe 25cwt 2qrs 25lb of brass, which hope your worshipps will take notice off."
2964,3,1326,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,08/03/1698,Fort,RAC,"According to your orders have with Mr Josiah Pearson and Mr Gervis Jackson inventored the Royall Companyes fort and factory now in my charge. Two inventoryes goes with Mr Jarvis Jackson, whose illness occasions his stay here. Also with this two hand canoe goes my February accompts. The 5th instant deceased Mr Lancelott Anderson. I have made an outcry of his things, when have received his money shall send it you. Inclosed is an instrument attested by those men which are wittness to John Newells will. Also a note of what stores our Gunner wants, desire this canoe may bring what shee can."
2965,3,1327,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,27/03/1698,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 24th instant came to hand last night. The Deane is ready to saile, but stayes (as they are obliged) to see the fort in the new Company possession
the first of Aprill, when God willing they intend to saile, by which time presume may have your letter, if nott shall desire their stay a day longer. Pray be as speedy as you can, for they are impatient to be gone, finding here not the least trade. I have prevailed with them for their cooper, tho' their new Chiefe told them he would protest against them, he belonging to the fort formerly, wherefore they are forced to give him another man in his roome. He will be wanted aboard till they saile, and then [I] shall have him, and shall by first send him to you. The Gunners stores wrote for in my last, wee are in great want off."
2966,3,1328,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,05/04/1698,Fort,RAC,"Both yours of the ultimo March and 2d Aprill have received, and have delivered your packquett according to your orders, and the sloope has her loading of shells, which will saile hence this night, with the land wind. I am sorry must advise you that I was disappointed of the cooper. I had him here ashore, and the Generall, Captain of the shipp and my selfe used all the perswations possible with him to stay, but would not, but desired to goe to their owne fort, where he was before, so that since he has made them to be worse then their promise to you, they have given another man to their Chiefe in his roome, and has carryed him off the Coast, contrary to his expectation. They desire that you will not take it amiss of them, for they thought the man would be as ready to serve the Company, as they was to lett him."
2967,3,1329,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,11/05/1698,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 16th instant have received, and accordingly have putt on board the Whidah Frigott, Capt. John Osborne commander, one chest fire lock musquets, and consined them to Mr Josiah Peirson. The sloope, Mr John Wilson Commander, sailed hence this morning, with his loading of shell. He was five dayes getting downe, by reason he had wind and currant contrary, and lay here four dayes before the canoes could work, the seas running high, which is the reason of his long stay. I have nott messured what he carryes, but have bought six hundred butts, and will buy noe more till these are gone. The vessell you mentioned pased by this place shewing no collours, butt anchored at Tesha under English coulers, where he panyar'd twelve people, one of which he released for two ounces gold, the rest he carryed away.
The 8th instant deceased Mr James Hayes Chyrurgeon. He made a will, a coppy goes herewith inclosed. I desire that as soone as this comes to your hands, that you will send me one to supply his place, such as you have till better comes,my men being very sickly and I beleive this att this time to be the sicklyest place on the Coast, and if should be taken ill my selfe it would be very hard, having none butt souldiers in the fort, and in case of death, know not what may become of the Companyes concerns and my owne. Should be very glad in case shipping do not arive if you could take three or four men from factoryes that are well manned, and send me here, being hardly well men to keep open the Castle gates. Here is no trade. At the end of this month shall make up my accompts."
2968,3,1330,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,28/05/1698,Fort,RAC,"This serves to acquaint you thatt I am in great want of a carefull sober Serjeant, and desire that you will be pleased to send me one express. John Burton yesterday morning att some dispute he had on the guard with the men, threw away his sword and cane and swore he would be Serjeant no longer, which I chanced to see, and having found him before, affter a short tryall, to be very unfiting for the place, I discharged him off itt, and putt him to his old station.
I shall nott goe without the fort gate before you send me one to supply his place.
Inclosed is a note againe of whatt stores our Gunner wants, which desire may be sent, or whatt part of itt you have to spare, being much wanted. Also the iron work as att foot, the vast raines wee have here having throwne our platforme next the sea down, and other part of the fort is in great danger, soe shall want itt as soone as possible, to break stones.

Also with the canoe goes a messenger from the King of Quambo to you, I presume about the Dankaras warrs."
2970,3,1332,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,09/07/1698,Fort,RAC,"I have put on board the sloope forty two timber peices which I bought of the Deane, and the remain[d]er of her loading with shells. I will gett what slaves
I can. If the Companys shipps doe come before wee have any shipping here to buy up slaves, and you give me a supply of goods imediately, I question not to gett a good part of one shipps complement in a month or 5 weeks time. I have received the wedges and one mawle, and desire the remainder of what wrote for, by first opportunity, as I may repair the fort before the latter rains, or a great part of it will fall. Desire the other mawles may be large.
[PS] The sloops canoe in bad weather broke from her sterne, and was taken up by a Dutch interloper, who has left her at Allampoe. I have sent for her. If she doe not come whilst the sloope is in sight, shall keep her till she returnes."
2971,3,1333,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,22/07/1698,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 17th instant have received, and am heartily gladd to heare of the arrivall of shipping, and hope the Prince of Orange is not alone. Nott knowing what goods you may have to supply me with, have at foot hereof sett a list of what goods are vendable here, of which please to send such a quantity as your supplyes will afford, with one hundred pieces Polonia linnen or sletias for forts use, tenn barrells gunpowder, 20 striped sattins, 200 English woollen carppets, 100 white blankets. The trade is open here, butt the road is never cleare of Dutch interlopers, who sell their perpetuanoes at 4a 6t each, which makes me not write for any, haveing already a quantity here, what cannot put off for gold or slaves, without other goods. Pray supply me with sheets and cases spirits as many as can possible spare.
PS. I hope the sloope is near your parts ere this. She sayled hence the 13th instant, in the morning, by which wrote you.
East India tapseils; ditto nicconeese; paper brawles; white long cloaths; ditto blue; 1 lb,
2 lb, 3 lb, 4 lb pewter basons; screwed juggs; brass digglins; sheets; blue plaines; cases spirits; seyes; broad chints; corrall if good red; Guinea stuffs"
2972,3,1334,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,25/07/1698,Fort,RAC,"I wrote you of the 22d instant an accompt of what goods are wanting here. This comes express to advise that about Fryday last fell in with Ningoe at Alampoe an English Companys ship, as they reported to the Negroes, and that they was driven from the Graine Coast thither, and that they came in company with another great ship, presume the Prince of Orange. I sent as soone as I had
the advise a canoe and a white man, but she was gone off to sea, to goe to Cabo Corso as they said, and have not heard any news of her since. You may know by what shipping you expect, whither it be true or not, but she was certainly an English shipp. I beleive the sloope will be a long time getting up there, she is still at Winneba. I wish I could have a supply of goods some other way, slaves being plenty here, and I have not goods to buy them."
2973,3,1335,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,03/08/1698,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 27th, 29th and 30th July have received, as also 21 chests sheets on accompt of the Royall Affrican Company of England. The shipp which was att Allampoe, if a Companyes shipp, will fall in to windward of your parts, for she must certainly make a voyage round, the currant makeing soe strong to leward. There was a white man belonging to the Dutch factory there on board, and he gave the same accompt as the natives, and that the Captain purchased about tenn slaves, and that he asked particularly for me by my name, which is all the accompt I can give. I hope ere this the sloope is arived in your parts, goods being in great want. Hope you have a supply off, for wee are in great want. In few dayes shall send my accompts.
PS. The Royall Companys packett came too late, Capt. John Sevoyce and Beaudwin Jacobe being the day before sailed for Allampo. I sent a canoe and a white man thither soe soone as I received yours, but it was too late, soe shall wait the next oppertunity."
2974,3,1336,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,05/08/1698,Fort,RAC,"This accompanys my accompts for June & July. Desire the canoe may be
presently returned, with as many slaves irons as she can well bring, haveing
none but what are in use."
2975,3,1337,Edward Searle,Accra,,Cape Coast Castle,17/08/1698,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 13th instant have received. Am glad the sloope is arived in your road. According to your orders I have made enquiery affter corne, but find old come very scarce, and my expence at present is above a chest a day, wherefore cannot give any assurance of supplying you here. I will get what I possible can, and when the ship taketh the slaves shall put every chest I have aboard, but I beleive that will be very little, for I am dayly in hopes of more slaves. I have been hindered a few dayes by a small interloper English who is at Allampo.
which hath stoped the traders comeing hither. There he has his complement, and sailes this day or tomorrow. I omited in my last to advise you that six seys rated per inventory _ damaged was sould for noe more then the vallue of 3oz 2a, as presume you have found in exammineing my accompts, which I notice now, that it might not be taken for an error, haveing sould all the refuged seys except them, and the best being all picked away, thought it better to take that then to lett them lye in the warehouse, as they have done already this severall years, which hope you will not disprove of.
This serves likewise to give you an accompt that some time since, haveing been to give a visit to my Dutch neighbour, whilst [I] was there happened a difference between a black belonging to the Dutch Towne and one of my boys, insomuch that the Dutch Black threatned what he would doe as I passed home, which my boy came and told me off, and I made it knowne to the Dutch Coapman, who sent for the man into the Castle. When he came he begged pardon, and said it was only words between boyes. However the Coapman confined him to the Castle, till I should be gone home, at which a mollotta named Brinee armed himselfe and tenn of his slaves, with one Amba, resolving to waylay me goeing home, and murder me, butt Briny by perswations and force of a Cabbosheer went home with his slaves. Nevertheless Amba still resolved on his bloody designe, which [I] knew nothing on till I was got about halfe way home, where in a cross path, the grass as high almost as himselfe, I met the villaine, which plainly appears had he not been frusterated of his consort, they would have endeavoured to have effected their designe, and nevertheless would this Amba [have done so], had not I had four armes with me, for there he stood with his peice ready, cartooch box by his side and a shot in his mouth. When I saw him I bid my boys ask him what he did there. He gave some cross words in Blacks, and asked for what the Dutch Coapman panniared his consort, and staying a little while, a Black belonging to the same Towne came to him and got away his gunn, soe I went on my way. I am apt to beleive that it was a designed thing to fall out with my boy, to cover their roaguery, haveing never had a sillable of difference with either of these fellows, or any in the towne, which makes me think they were set on by some Peter Passop, a cheife actor in Succondee tragedy, being then there, who acknowledged he was told of it, but he was drunk and gone to sleep, which was his excuse to me the next day. This narrow escape of my life [I] was forced to be content with, as well for want of souldiers as officers, which was our garrison well supplyed with the natives durst never offer such affronts, and commit murders as they dayly doe, tho' ever
so much prompted to our by our barbarous neighbours, watching and waiting with patience to come up with these villaines. I have got Amba from aboard a Dutch interloper. When I sent to the Captain, desireing him to paniar the roague, and acquainted him of the action, he presently replyed should it be the loss of his shipp and cargoe if he came aboard I should have him, and it happened that he imediately came, soe I had him sent me by the same canoe I sent aboard, now I have him in possession. I desire you to order what shall be done with him. My time, if please God, being but short here, am not willing to act any thing as may give occation for any to say after I am gone, that I prejudiced the intrest of the Royall Company or my successor, wherefore doe advise you that the Cabbosheers of the towns of Ningo, Bony, Tesha and Labbordee, as well as of the Deans, Dutch and my owne [towns], has been with me, and offers that they will take fetishes that never any affront shall be given to the English in any of these parts any more, but will paniar anyone that shall any ways committ the least affront and deliver him up. My answer to them was my full designe was to make him a slave or putt him to death, but that if they had effected their designe it relyed on you to seek revenge, wherefore should doe nothing but what you would order, and that I beleived they would have a very hard matter to get him clear, on which accompt goeth this canoe and the bearer at their charge.
PS. If you have any brass kettles to spare please to send one caske.

PS. The sloopes compas being out of order, the mate made his address to me for one, which I got Capt. Warmer to spare for four angles. The old canoe belonging to the factory is broke all in pieces, I was forced to get a new one to load the sloope."
2978,3,1340,Edward Barter,Allampo,,Cape Coast Castle,01/01/1000,Fort,RAC,"These serves only to advise your Worshipps that the King & natives here are very desireous for your Worshipps to settle a Factory here, and have been dunning me ever since I have been here, and would never lett me be att quietness, soe thought fitting to acquaint your Worships therewith. As for trade, here is very good trade for slaves & money, particularly slaves. Had I been only to bought [= buy] slaves, I might [have] bought 3 or 4 hundred since I have been here, and I am certaine if I had but good goods I might have taken above one hundred bendeys, for here is a country that lyes near here, between this & Quamboe, that trades with money & has it plenty, but cannot goe to Accra by reason of the Quamboers, and they correspond with noe country nor Cabbosheers without it be with Addoe of Quamboe or their people, and Addoe hath sent here to me twice & has promised to give pawns with the King of this place which is considerable, either their sons or two hundred bendys, and has promised as soon as answer comes from your Worships he will come down himself. Upon the perusall your Worships will send a flagg by the bearer & a little brandy for a sirrup, if it be but a pint. Here are oyster shells in abundance within half a quarter of a mile of this place, and stones & wood in abundance. They promise they will fetch shells, stones & wood, and help to doe anything the white man your Worships shall please to send will command. The people here are very civill, for you may lett your things lye anywhere [blank], for they worship a white man more than they doe their feteeches. As for cows I am forct to send over the River of Vulter for, and am informed by the Cormanteen people here that it is not a usuall custome to doe. My people is not yett come hither as yett, should [have] sent your Worships word else. The Dutch has been [at]tempting much since I came for to settle a flagg here, but the aforementioned Addoe advised them not to lett them come there, but rather the Portuguizes first, and according as your Worships thinck fitting and send a flagg, they will send up pawns by me when I come, which will be about three weeks or under. I have had great trouble with the goods to putt them off, by reason of their being soe much damaged. The names of the countryes where the trade comes from are as followeth [blank].
The reason that Addoe as aforementioned corresponds with these people, is because he (whenever your Worships build a Fort here) is to have half the sallary & customs, for the three forts at Accra belongs to the King of Quamboe. Shall advise your worshipps further when I gett more paper or come my self.
PS. I desire your Worships to send me a little paper by return, for all my paper was wett & I had but one sheet when I came on shore. Here is a very good landing place. The Blacks here are at charge of canoe hire themselves."
2979,3,1341,Edward Barter,Allampo,,Cape Coast Castle,24/08/1694,Fort,RAC,"Yours of the 21th I received, and according to your Worshipps order I have sent what sorts of goods are best here for purchase of slaves is bouges, brawles, tapseles, white long clothes, blanketts, iron barrs, white potkeys, powder, blew bafts of a deep blue, Turkey carpetts blue, all the aforementioned goods if good mixt one with another, but if the least hole in them they will not have them. As for slaves here are enough, for here was a Dutch interloper commanded by Francis Johnson, who came to an anchor here on the 1013<math id=""actrade-9780197263921-math-6"" display=""inline"">

</math> instant at evening and purchased 120 slaves with blue baffts, carbines & bouges, had his choyce of slaves & sayled the 15th instant about 5 of the clock in the evening. Your Worships of the 21th should have mett me upon my return, which your servant is very sorry he did not answer your Worships expectation. The reason is the cowes I sent to b[u]y over the river cannot pas over for the great quantity of raine which hath lately fell here, but expect them every day. As soon as come shall deliver them to Mr John Bloome att Accra, and make the best of my way up to your Worshipps according to order. As for the flagg [sent] to me according to the request of the Blacks here, has not as yet been lett fly, for just as I received it here came a canoe from Cormanteen to bye cowes, which they frequently doe, and the Captain of the canoe named Amesanee informed the natives here that if the white men once gott footing here that they would use them very hard, and debarr them from all priveleidges, and send them off the Coast upon any small account. They being very fearfull people, refused then to have it, and their joy was turned then to greife. I informed them otherwise, that pallaver then was over, then came Capt. Francis Johnson, & Peater that padled his canoe told them that if they did suffer the Englishmen to settle there, that they must not expect to sell any more slaves aboard of any ships but English. He little knows I have heard of it. He comes in company of the bearer hereof."
2980,3,1342,John Wortley,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,05/01/1692,Fort,RAC,"This is to acquaint your Worships of the arrivall of Capt. Thomas Sherley and Capt. John Edwards, Commanders of the East India Merchant and Kendle Frigatt, who came to anchor the 28th June. Likewise the Supply, Capt. James Lashley, came here the 17th August, with Mr Edward Jackline as second, and a cargoe amounting to 2001b:03:04 [= 200.03.04] consigned to me for your Worships. They carried off in all from hence 1150 merchantable slaves, where of 124 men was shipped aboard the Supply, and departed this road in company togither the 7th September, without the losse [of] any men but one, which was one of Capt. Edwards men, the boat being put of from the ship went a great way from the ship to the leeward & rowing up to windward againe was drove ashore by bad weather and soe was drounded. Mr Humphries departed from hence in good health, but have understood since by a Portiguize shipp he was verey dangerously sick and vomited neer 2 quarts of blood the time he was ashore at St Thomas. All pallavors that we had formerly with the country is done, and now doe leave [= live] very peaceably with the King and country, without any more pallaveroes. We are all in good health at this present, which I pray God to containow soe. I hope your Worships will be pleased to consider the cargoe you sent consigned per Capt. Lashley will but little more then pay every man his sallery, besides the expence of Factory &ca, which is not verie small, and goe as neer as possible I can. Before you sent me these goods down, here was but a verie little left in the Factory, which have sent your Worshipps the coppie as we were apprasid by Capt. James Lashley, Mr Thomas Mead, Mr Benjamin Sherley, Mr William Jones and Mr Christopher Price. Besides was forcied by the request of James Lashley to disburse 33 iron barrs and 32 pautkies out of the cargoe you sent me, for to deffray charge of canoe hier and other expence, by reasone of his cargoe falling short, which he hath given me recipt for under his hand and witnessed by Christopher Price and Benjamin Sherley for
the delivery of the goods, and shall place it to the Royall Companies accompt. I desire your Worships to send me ane accompt how I shall pay the white men here their sallary, which must be in goods, for your Worships do verie well know that there is no gold to be had to pay them worth [= with] all, they say if they take goods they do expect them at prime coast. Sirs, what news we hear is that the Dutch is doeing their indeavour to put the English out of these parts, by makeing their pallaviros with the King of Whydah to come and settle here, and that they designe to take [the] Factory that was formerly Capt. Whybornes for to live in, which I have after his dec[e]ase rebuilt, a pritty large house, by reasone the Blacks in the country did pull the old house all downe, therefore [I] did do this for to put a Black that is one of Offrys great Cabboosheers, an Accra man, into it and to pay him 4ac per month to stand by me on all occasions or pallaveroes, he is a man very honest and true to his trust to the English att all times. I am now almost able to defend ourselves against the Dutch and French if they should oppose us, for have placed two flanckers, which will clear the walls round the Factory, that no enimey can come to hurt us, and as for Capt. Whybornes old house, if the Dutch come to live there I can soon beat them out with the guns we have in the Factory, which is 7 in all, vizt 3 great guns and 2 patereroes and 2 drakes, but do wish much that your Honours will be pleased to send 3 or 4 of your great guns, about three or 4 hundred weight, likewise shott answerable for them, which will be a great safeguard to the Royall Companies Factory. The French have been about building flanckers in their house just over against us, which I seing did soon hinder him and made him pull it all down again. Have had a great many pallaviroes with him, but now pretty well qua[i]led him, and do much expect when a French ship comes here that we shall have a great many pallavroes with them. Gentlemen, as you have containowed me in my place as Cheife in the Royall African Companies service in Whydah, and likewise have sent down Mr Edward Jackline to be my assistant, for which, Sirs, I doe give you all many thanks. I shall be ever bound to pray for your health and prosperity, and do hope that the Royall Company my masters will confirme it to me. I question not but most of you Gentlemen do know my ability, therefor shall do nothing that may cause my Royall masters hindrance of the confirmation, but shall to the utmost of my power serve them with all faithfulness and honesty, as a servant ought to serve his master. Sirs, I desire you [if] there be any ships English on the coast to advice
the Commander to dispose of the goods that are not vendable hear to windward which are vizt.




goods not vendable

Likewise a man or two more for to be hear. We have at present 4 white men with my self, and 2 of them but small help to me in bissiness, so shall leave it to your Worships consideration."
2981,3,1343,John Wortley,Whydah,,Cape Coast Castle,17/01/1692,Fort,RAC,"Since my last to you, which [was] on the 5th instant, the Dutch Chief with 2 white men more came from Offra in a ship under pretence of buying slaves only, but his designe is likewise to settle here, which I indeavour to hinder as much as I can. They are now at the French Factory and intend to bring goods to their house. I sent to the Dutch man and told him he should neither buy slaves for his ship nor settle in the country, he sent me word that he would not ask my leave. Likewise I desired the French to turne him out of his Factory, or els I would fire into his house, but he presently histed his flagg and said he would send people to break downe our wall, upon which answer I fired severall great shott into ther factory, upon which severall Blacks they hired came towards our Factory, but I soon sent them back againe. The French formerly was building a flancker against us, but I soon made them pull it downe again, but now they are at work containualy to build on, but I have not powder nor shott to hinder them. We expect Offry every day upon this country, for not long since he sending
some of his people from Offra, which place he had destroyed, these people sett upon them and cut most of them off."
