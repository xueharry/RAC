to an answer of the fire itt is as followeth. On Monday being the 16th instant the fire began about 8 a clock at night about 50 paces to windward from us, which consumed within less than  of an hours time above 200 houses, occasioned by one frieing of fish in palm oyle. The old Queene and Captain Bracon lost all they had, only saved their gold, and as to the Royall Company's concerns att the heate of the fire [I] was afraid that I should not save one cracra worth but the great mercy of God Almighty and assistance of my boys and Commenda people saved all only 1 chest of sheets, 21 lead barrs, 5 31b pewter basons, 28 41b ditto, 85 chests of corne, 10 pewter jugs. The remains [I] have with Mr Smith compared with my accounts and books and found that did agree. The lead barrs, juggs, basons, were in the roome with the iron [and?] are melted, I have saved of itt as much as possible could. The sheets were in my owne room which are consumed with most part of my owne goods. As to the corne [I] had bought and paid for 129 chests, whereof is remayning above 40 odd. I doe assure your honour if such an accident had befallen the Dutch, they would not have saved one penny's worth. The Dutch heareing that our factory was consumed with all the Royall Company's concerns, were very hott to settle their factory, but I have stopt their designe, and what is possible of the contract shall be observed. Here is in the road a great French ship between 30 or 40 guns, about 200 men. I told the Capushers last night to remember your honours contract, and that none here should come ashoare for [I] intend absolutely with Captain Bracons assistance to hinder all them that should act anything prejudiciall to my masters the Royall Affrican Company. Here are likewise in the road two English interlopers, the one called Captain Young the other I doe not know. I desire your honour to send mee your order and Councill if any come ashoare to hinder their designe. I desire your honour be pleased to send some body here to see what is best to be done about the factory, either repairing this or to build where the factory was formerly, and what length and breadth your honour will be pleas'd to order it. I also desire your honour that you would be pleased to consider the loss and charge I am att, also to allow some gratuity to the people that soe trusty assisted mee in saveing the Company's goods, and especially Mr Harper for his care in the midst of the fire, for wee all were afraid the factory would blow up by reason of the powder. If my opinion may be excepted I could advise what is to be done, and att the least charge, about our factory. Soe haveing no more to inlarge only referr the rest to the report of Mr Smith whoe will give your honour a particular account.

These may acquaint your honour that the Cabbisheers are very eager to goe about the building and have been two dayes att worke in breaking of earth for the worke, but they declare themselves unable to goe about the walls without the assistance of some better workeman than any att this place, which I understand by Captain Bracon to be the truth for although hee hath soe many slaves of his owne yett the building his house cost him one bendy to an Fanteener who he brought from Fanteen to direct and oversee his worke, wherefore if your honour be pleased that this building be brought to any perfection before the raines itt will be verry fitt that two or three men that have knowledge in building be provided and sent up with speed. The Fanteeners are said to be the best workemen, whereof there lives one with Captain Cooffy whoe knows his business verry well and may serve your honour in this affaire.
The Dutch Copeman is very busie in provideing for his building, hee hath gott a sloopes loading of timber from Shuma and hath here a carpenter a makeing of doors and windows. Hee expects to have his house up in six weeks for hee is to have 20 slaves from the Mina, hee will make his house two storyes high with only foure large roomes, two below and two above, the whole length 59 foot and 18 foot broad, the walls two foot thick. The goods the Dutch have here are sayes, iron barrs and perpetuano's which hee sells at 9a per piece, brandy, and Beneen cloaths. The Copeman tells mee hee hath found but small trade since his comeing, which hee does not much notice soe long as there are noe goods att the Mina to supply him with but soe soone as supplyes come, which are dayly expected by foure ships from Europe, hee expects to have a considerable trade though little to his masters profitt for hee says that by his brothers order hee will undersell all ships that comes in the road, they selling soe cheape as they will. The trade is but little att present, which is the reason that the boysado's and perpettuanoes remaine unsold, but Captain Bracon desires mee to acquaint your honour that there is some probability in selling the perpettuanoes as likewise a considerable quantity more before any ships come downe to hinder the trade, for he sayes that soe long as your honour will sell the Royall Companys goods att the same rates the Dutch does that they shall have but little trade in such goods as your Honour consignes to this place, which truely I verryly beleeve hee haveing the whole trade of the place in his hands. Upon Fryday last there was 4 interlopers in this roade, their names I can give your honour noe accoount of for the Blacks could only tell mee that they were English ships and interlopers, they are all gon to leward, soe that the roade is att present altogether without shipping though I doe not know how long for I am informed that Captain How with two more are to windward.

384,1,384,Thomas Burrows,Egya,,Cape Coast Castle,08,Fort,RAC,"I have yours of the 7th instant, and am sorry to heare that my practices or behaviour amongst the Blacks, now I have given them almost halfe I have in the country, should be soe ill as to cause any of them to give your honour falce reports of mee. I can safely say I have not a word of differance with any black since I came to this place, which your Honour may be better inform'd by the Whitemen that has lived with mee. You are pleased to tax mee with entertaining the master of an interloper. Its true that since I came here that one Hudson, whoe was master of an interloper from Barbado's, came ashoare here and being my verry entimate freind told mee hee made bold to come up to the house to see mee, haveing a letter for mee from Barbado's. I desired him to goe from hence, which accordingly hee did, and I am sure was not halfe an houre ashoare. I was not att that time capeable to entertaine him or to seize him, haveing the feavour and ague. Upon the next day hee writt mee a noate ashoare per a black that [being] formerly acquaintance and seeing mee to be a new beginer to house keeping, hee had sent mee a sow pigg and 3 Muscoval ducks. Mr Sheares comeing here since told mee the ducks belonged to your Honour, and that Captain Clarke heard Hudson say they were sent you from Barbado's, which has ever since been a trouble to mee that hee should give mee your present, although att first I designed to present them to you, but when Mr Sheares told mee the ducks was your honours I was resolved to know the truth of itt and spake with Captain Clarke before I sent them. I hope you will not any wayes take this amiss of mee, for I protest had there been the least word of sending them to you as a present from Barbado's spoken to mee, I would not have kept them 12 houres. I have per bearer sent the 3 ducks and a douzen of good fowles with them, which I hope you will please to except of, and hope your honour will harbour noe ill thought of mee for that action, haveing writt the whole truth of itt, and as for the selling of slaves itt was more then could doe for I have not bought any since I came here. Itts true a boy that I had before I came to Cabo Corsoe, att my first comeing here had stolen severall things from mee and haveing whipt him, [he] run away from mee for two dayes, and rashly and foolishly I sent him aboard ship and sold him for rum, which I have often since repented, and hope your Honours pardon, haveing writt you the whole truth to every passage, but suppose the informer might make an addition to them. I doe not expect to doe the least thing that hold can be taken of, but itt will be immediatly carryed to your Honour, for I am much envyed by comeing here, but not by the Blacks but whites. Mr Thelwall taxes mee much with informing your honour against him, and that particularly I writt that hee had cursed you and spoken verry ill words of you; I begg your Honour to favoure mee soe farr with a line or two for to cleare mee of itt, for without hee will not be satisfied. If should wrighte any such thing I should be a verry greate rogue, for I never heard him say ill of you.

479,1,479,John Thorne,Offra,,Cape Coast Castle,04,Fort,RAC,"Heareing of Captain Parris quick dispatch last voyage att Whidda, I encouraged Captain Low to take in his slaves there, and comeing to anchor in the road I was sent on shoare by Captain Lowe and Mr Gouldings order to know how things past as well att Ophra as Whida and in which place I might best and soonest purchase his slaves, and the next day returning on board againe with answer from the King that if Captain Lowe will come himselfe on shoare hee would agree with him for his whole complement of slaves, whereupon Captain Lowe and Mr Goulding went on shoare and the King likeing his cargoe promised him his slaves in 26 dayes, which might have been accomplished had there not come two interlopers into the road, a French man and a Portuguese. Captain Lowe haveing gott goods ashoare Mr Goulding bought slaves att the Kings house att Sabba [var. Saba] and I was ordered at Agriffie the lower towne, but after hee had gott all his slaves, and haveing before promised the King to settle a factory there, hee [= the King] would not lett the goods which were on shoare be carried off, whereupon Captain Lowe and Mr Goulding ordered mee and Robert Chapman to stay with them there, an account of them you will find enclosed herein. Therefore if your worship be pleased to settle a factory lett mee have your order for itt, that I may make provision for the reception of any ships you shall be pleased to send. I have little to say in the praise of the place, only itt is something more healthfull then Ophra and is a place of free trade for all ships that comes. There is two factory's already, a French and a Portuguese, and interlopers dayley frequent the place. I have done my best to prevent them, to the hazard of my life by one Captain Beacon, who sett a pistole to my breast but I prevented his designe, for the Blacks will have noe striveing one with another but will have all ships trade that comes. Therefore if your worshipp please to continue this place at Whidda itt will require two whitemen, for I have but two with mee, for itt being put to Mr Crosses choyse to goe home or stay he sent for mee to Ophra to take possession of the Companys concerns, the which libberty I could hardly obtaine because of Captain Low's promise to the King, but was forced to come away without anything for my necessaries, neither can I as yet gett the other white man away, though I have made tryall to the loss of all that I brought out of England with mee. If both places be kept itt will be a meanes to dispatch ships the sooner, for there is butt 4 or 5 hours journey betwixt them and you cannot miss of slaves att either place if you send any quantity of booges, and they will be a meanes to put off almost any other sort of goods except iron barrs. A note of what goods is vendible you will find inclosed herein. Wee have great occasion for a canoe or two and some padles. The great canoe was stav'd upon the breakers and the 7 hand canoe broke away from the sterne of Captain Low's ship in a turnadoe, soe that wee have great need of canoes and you had as good send noe ships as noe canoes. For canoemen I have 13 here, and if you send downe any more pray lett them be pawnes, for those which came with Captain Low proved rogues. For the last 3 dayes when there was most occasion for them, could not gett them to carry off the slaves, to Captain Lowes great damage, but was forced to hyre others, for which offence I hope your Worship will be pleased to take itt into consideration. Captain Lowe departed from Whidda the 20th Aprill last with his complement of slaves and sent Mr Goulding on shoare att Ophra, and what goods came on shoare there Mr Cross I hope certifies you in his letters, and likewise of Mr Gouldings death, hee being spectator, and therefore needless to insert itt here, and of his charges in rebuilding some small part of the factory, and what hee hath left mee to build, which will cost 26 slaves to compleat itt, and I have not wherewithall to pay for itt, but the Blacks are soe civill to stay till the next ship comes. Captain Parris lately arriv'd at Whidda, where in a short time gott his complement of slaves and departed the 20th of this instant, leaveing Mr Wyborne to settle a factory, and the said Mr Wyborne is now building a large house for the reception of interlopers. Captain Rickard departed hence the 12th November haveing gott his complement of slaves in 20 dayes for money and what goods hee brought with him, for I had not any goods to supply him with all but iron barrs, and they will not off here upon any account. Pray be pleased to send downe money to pay the souldiers their wages, for here is two which are 12 months behind and the other 6 months and myselfe likewise, for I want cloaths and other necessaries. The Phidalgoe would desire your Worship to send him a dram cup.

487,1,487,Timothy Armitage,Ouidah,,Cape Coast Castle,24,Fort,RAC,"In my last bearing date the 26th past per Captain North gave your Honours an account of the then present needfull, and did hope by this conveyance might have given your Honours a satisfactory account of the well settlement of this your factory, which doe now find will never be effected as long as Mr Winder tarry's upon this place, his humour not suiting with the nature and disposition of the blacks here, whoe has noe love or kindness in the least for him. They have since my last to your Honours endeavoured a second time sending him off, by pigniaring of him with a possitive resolution that hee shall not remaine upon this place. The reasons of their disgust against him I have endeavoured as nigh as possible to gather from them, which goes here inclosed, the most part of which I must assert the verrity thereof, as can likewise Captain Ambrose and Mr Thomson, both whome as well as myselfe have endeavoured to secure your honours interest by counselling of him upon a consultation together held the 21st instant to cause those goods that were carried down to Captain Wybornes in the night time out of your honours warehouse to be brought up againe, and to apply himselfe to the Agent and Councill at Cabo Corsoe, by takeing the oppertunity of a canoe now going thither, to both which he would not agree nor assent, but has and does endeavour to convert the said goods into gold to your honours prejudice, pretending your honours are more indebted to him, as your honours may perceive by the inclosed account, which hee gave mee to send home to your honours when [he] thought to have gott his passage upon one of these two ships now in port, vizt the Goulden Fortune and the George. I have as bounden drawne up some objections against his said account, which together goes here inclosed for your Honours better government. I am sorry should have soe just occasion and soe bad a subject to enlarge upon, and soe soone contradict my last, but shall as soone as may be dispatch away the canoe to the Agent and Councill, whose further orders shall here attend; and shall per Captain Ware give your honours a more full account.
[Inclosure 1]
Hereunder follow the reasons of the disgust the Blacks has taken against Mr Winder, vizt.
1st. When he first came to settle amongst them his bad language and carriage suited not their humours, which occasioned a small breach.
2ndly. Upon which he left their towne and the Companys factory and tooke up his aboade for some time att Captain Wybornes house, whome they knew was not concern'd in the Companys business, which created in them a great dislike to him, they being naturally covetous of trade.
3rdly. His endeavouring to gett into their debts, and actually running into one Captain Bibbees debts, when afterward they understood hee did it with a designe to goe off with one Fullwood, an interloper then in port, to which end hee had actually put aboard 8, and laid under an obligation to make itt up 40 slaves. 4thly. His cutting of sletias and lessening the bunches of beads, which they looke upon as an absolute cheate to their country.
5thly. His carrying of goods out of the factory in the night time to the Lower Towne and to Captain Wyborne's house, which soe far as I can perceive have been the cause that have soe much insenced them against him.

490,1,490,Timothy Armitage,Ouidah,,Cape Coast Castle,05,Fort,RAC,"Inclosed goes copie of my last via St Thoma per Captain Ware, who departed this place thee 3rd instant, although had all his Negro's aboard the 28th past and upon thee same day took his leave of this our towne, although tarryed below att Captain Wybornes severall day's, which with his leaving behind but 21 iron barrs in the factory creates the suspition in mee of his haveing many more slaves aboard then his complement, for that Mr Thomson whoe acted and did all the business in the buying the slaves, upon the 28th instant told mee that then they had their full complement, when that I was assured hee had not disposed of in silke more then 2 slaves, and what became of the rest I leave your Worship to judge, as likewise a parcell of corrall and some muzlins which were not here disposed of. As not seeing their invoyces could not make any computation, but tooke notice of what goods they had, an account whereof goes here inclosed, with their prize how disposed of, by which your Worship may see whether they have done the Company right or not. I doe not remember that did see any other sorts of goods but what is here specified. The wrong Mr Bathurst did the Company in selling their booges for gold, cutting their sletias, have in mine of the 28th October past given your Worship an account of, copie whereof goes here inclosed, as likewise copie of last to England with Mr Winders account etc., whoe (although much against his will, haveing endeavoured his passage upon all ships that has bin her, as well interlopers as Companys ships) comes in the canoe, whome I safely wish with your Worship. What goods he tooke out of the factory in the night time hee has disposed them the major part for gold, and the rest for cloaths, with an intention to have seen England before Cabo Corsoe, although now prevented. I must needs acquaint your Worship that many day's before I arrived here in Captain North that hee had contracted with one Fullwood, an interloper, to have put aboard 40 slaves, and to have went with them himselfe to Barbado's, whereof I am sencible that 8 of them was actually put aboard. Together with Mr Winder comes one Daniell Roe whoe left and ran away from Captain North, whome Mr Winder has entertained ever since; his designe in itt (I am inform'd, if things here went according to his expectation) was in some short time to have sent him away with slaves for New England in a New England man hee expected downe here, of which as bounden thought myselfe obliged to give your Worship an account, leaving the sequell of all things to your Worships prudence. I have likewise sent you up in the canoe one Patrick Welch, whome I understand ran away from the Castle to the prejudice of the Companys interest, hee was brought hither by one Wood, an interloper, and putt aboard of one Wilcocks now in port, whoe turned him here ashoare upon some differance happening.I did hope, as your Worship may perceive by the inclosed copies, might have sent you up the canoe before this, but that the canoemen did evade itt by the non properness of the season of the yeare, with the like excuses, and have been forced to furnishe them in order to their dispatches as att bottom, of which your Worship may please to take noate. I now question not in the least, but that the Companys affaires here will be in a mighty good posture and condition, and hope towards the maintaining of which your Worship will consider a fresh supply, Mr Winder haveing left nothing behind him that will att present purchase victualls, allthough have and shall ever endeavour the maintaining the Companys, their rights, honour and privilidge here, and the true discharging of those bonds and obligations under which I lay, which hope time may veryfie. As to the removing Captain Wyborne in complyance to your order, I see not how myselfe or any other in the Companys service can effect it, soe long as the Companys ships doe maintaine and uphold him and supply him with guns, all sorts of ammunition, with other materialls, as Captain Ware has latly don. I have wrote to Mr Thorne severall times but as yett can gett noe account from him of what number of barrs remaine in the factory, although hee writes mee word is willing to goe off and shall, if can gett leave of the King, send Andrew Crosbie thither to take an account and endeavour their disposall for the Companys use. What goods most in demand your Worship will find att foot hereof, for which goods slaves can never be wanting, although there should come downe never soe many ships, and question not but in a verry short time this place may prove of verry great importance to the Company. And if they should altogether quitt Ophra, this place is sufficient for to slave all their ships, for that they doe and must send their slaves from Ophra hither, and that if your Worship and Councill thought itt convenient and approved thereof here might be alway's in bank 100 slaves to supply upon any occasion any of the Companys ships according to your order and directions, which presume your Worship will find itt in time much to the Companys interest.
[PS] May itt please your Worship, there is great occasion of brandy here in the factory.

579,1,579,James Nightingale,Alampo,Edgar,Cape Coast Castle,06,Transatlantic Voyage,RAC,"My last to your honour was the 24th March, wherein I desired of your honour more recrutt of goods by reason sayes, perpettuanes, Ginny stuffs, Welch plaines, knives doe not goe of for slaves, and the Dutch shipp lying heare with good cowries, long cloth, fine sletias, bright musquetts, also gives a great rate for slaves, putts me to a stand, also is heare 2 English interlopers which gives 2 ounces of gold for a slave. Therefore pray consider in what a condition wee are in. I doe ashure yor honour I doe my best indeavour.
The Negroes promises faire, but currant goods purchases slaves, which are broad tapseeles, long clothes white, sheets, brawles, fine sletias, broad nicanneese, allejares, read ground pintadoes, bright musquetts, but especally cowries. Wee have not above 135 Negroes aboard, but the people of the countrey which are gone for slaves are not come downe. Wee expect them dayly with a good quantity, and then will doe my indeavour.
Your honour is not unsensable how far wee have gott in the 20 dayes of demorage after the 64 according to charter party, therefore pray lett me have your Honours and Councills order if you thinke it convenient for Captain Bowler to stay longer upon the coast then the 20 dayes. It would be a great shame, also noe little charges to our masters that the first ship by your Honours dispatched from Guiny should goe without her complement of slaves or there about.
My small oppinion is this, that if your honour keepe the shipp longer then the 20 dayes, and send some of the goods afore mentioned, especially broad tapseeles and some other of those which are in the Castle, I doe beleeve by degreese and good industry wee may gitt the ships complement of slaves or there about, in 6 weekes time.
In my last I forgott to mention of 5 pieces of sayes and 24 blew potkeys I sent to James Mills and Galansa at Wyamba in the 2 hand canoe, with an order to dispose of them for slaves against the canoe comes backe, and if I find good trade would send the 5 hand canoe with more goods, by reason sayes doe not goe of here, I ordered him likewise if could git noe slaves for the goods, to dispose of them for gold, and send it per the 2 hand canoe, for gold will purchase slaves heare.

1454,2,814,John Carter,Ouidah,,Cape Coast Castle,01,Fort,RAC,"Yours by the 4 hand canoe were all received and they were speedy in their passage, but they would not returne in [so] small a canoe but stay'd for mine and Quashee, that Captain Low hired at Annamaboe, which now goes in company together. I likewise received all yours, I suppose, by severall ships; but could not answer them reddily by reason the ships did not return to Cabo Corso, for their has been no opertunity that I could here of or procure butt I have writ up since the 10th of March last twelve months past, though I have endeavour'd and profferd good encouragement, yet could I not perswade any canoemen to goe up, haveing been well supply'd and furnish'd with necessaryes, [and a] canoe for that purpose, and within two months I hired 30 canoemen, that our own ships brought down, to goe up, and on a suddain for noe reason that I know the most of them ran away, and disperced them selves amongst the Mine canoes. Therefore unless you can here [= hire] and oblige a gang of canoe men to come down and returne imediately, it is allmost impossible to perswade them to goe up at any other time than about the hermitan time, and this I beleive is not unknown to Mr Winder.
Notwithstanding you seem to admire in severall of your letters that you here

not from me, but indeed [I] have the gratist cause of admiration, first that the Company at my request and desire should buy a small vessell and send her out on purpose and purely for an advice boat from Cabo Corso to this place and to pass and repass, as occasion required and time would permitt, for the better settlement and government of this factory, but since the time I came here niether shee nor any other vessell have sent, though I have been inform'd by severall, that somtimes one vessell was designed to be sent down and other times another, [so] that I did still live in hopes. Now there is three reasons for such a vessell to be sent, first because the Company did order it; secondly because the destruction by fire did request it; thirdly because you did not here from us in soe long time. Twas requested a vessell should have been sent to se in what condition we were in, I mean the factory was in, which might very well be thought to be bad enough after such distraction [sic] by fire and no house to put our heads in but an interloper. Before I came out of England I told the Company we could send advice home with more certainty at some times of the year than to Cabo Corso, therefore desired the said vessell and they granted it.
The last letter that Mr Winder wrot to Cabo Corso to Agent Greenhill I saw when I was there, wherein he advised the Agent that 500 iron bars was proper to be sent down in a cargo, and since that time very few ships have brought out any and then but few in a cargo, which must of necessity make them a commodity. Notwithstanding all this Mr Winder hath advised those ships that had any to dispose of them before they came here. The last he so advised was Mr Elwes, who by reason of that advice sold all his bars to windward, and did not bring one here, as if purposely he [= Winder] designed to doe us all the ingury he can, which I admire att. I doe admire that the Affrican Merchant, the Company[s] one [= own] ship comeing to the Company[s] own factory, should be stint'd to a short cargo and with a great quantity of large bouges, soe much behinde merchantable, that it was 10 slave loss to her cargo in slaves, and I admire the said ships cargo was not consign'd to me, the reason for it would be as wellcome to me as a mark of gold. I am shure you must allow my expences here to be greater than any mans on the Coast, and (excepting the Agent) my sallery and security greater than any persons

than on the Coast, as [I] imagaine, but for these and other favours from you Gentlemen at Cabo Corso I thank you for, as sending down liquors for factoryes expences, and a convenient supply of goods, and the great conveniency of the advice boate. The last letter I sent you by the canoe was the 10th of March last, and that and the former gave you an account that I wanted goods, and you have sent me none since but a little in Captain Lowder.
I have no goods of the Companyes, but am forc'd to make use of the estate of deceas'd persons and my own to maintain the factory, therefore canot make up my account till I am supplyd. I hope shall not be distress'd like Deans to pawn the factory, therefore I request you will be please to order down by a speedy conveyance, and [sic] a large stock of goods, that I may be furnished to purchase a quantity of Negroes reddy against any ships arrivall; and the goods I desire are, vizt 1000 iron barrs; 20 barrells bougees; 100 long cloths; 100 white bafts; 100 allejars; 100 pintadoes, white ground; 600 pautkeis; 6 pieces of scarlett cloth; 2 pieces redd cloth; 40 red perpetuanoes; currall [= coral], if any; good rangoes, if any; lemmons past, white and purple, as big as pease; large christall; christoll stripd white; sletias, if any. If the George sloope be arrived at Cabo Corso, as I hope she may, I request your Honour will please to order her down, with what goods you please to send downe, and if you can furnish her with 6 or 8 oars for rowing, I will [put] 20 or 30 stout slaves one [= on] board, who will quickly be entstruckt'd to row, which may be a great help to her comeing up. If soe accomplished I would not in the least doubt of getting up in her in 14 or 20 days time, and and I long to se Cabo Corso, therefore hope there will be none soe unkind as to putt a stop, or delay any means, that may tend to soe reasonable happiness. Gentlemen I came out of England in good equipage as to security sallery and great promises from the Company, with a small vessell, called a smack, which was brought and sent out purposely for my use, as Cheife of this factory, well knowing the necessity of such an expedient at this place, now depriv'd of the conveniency of the own [= one] and my expectation being wholly frustrated in the performance of the other, pray doe not mock at my misfortunes, because I am not soe happy as to be at Cabo Corso, where some have had the advantage of rising to greater preferment than they came out for.
You will doe me a great favour if you will give me your sentement what you think the Company designd when they sent out a vessell and call'd her the advice boat or packett vessell for Whiddah. Captain Bridges is now arrivd the 4th March, and in your letter by him you tell me of severall Mine canoes come up, which I beleive to be true, but they doe nott goe of from hence but from Pickaninee Popo,  [so] that I am not acquainted with their departure, but if I were, I should not have write by them by reason I have at the same time been sending up my own canoe, which now is above 3 months past and so long delayd by reason of the roguishness of the canoemen, that I had spoake to and hired, a list of their names and places here send inclosed. I have at all times of the year indeavour'd to gett canoe men and profer'd them any cano they would take, and 7 and 8 cloths a man to goe up, but could not prevaile till now [with] those canoemen that comes up, and all the reason I can gather is that the Comanders are put to hire canoemen themselves, and by that means the canomen think themselves noe waies relayted to the Company; but when the Commanders discharges them think themselves abused by me, I suppose, because they have not the canoe given them, though at the same time I offer them a canoe if they will goe, but they will be sole masters thereof, for the canomen generall[y] importune the Comander to give them thee canoe when the ship is slaved, which the Commanders for the most part grant upon their good behaviour, which is but seldom. Now by reasons they gett not the canoe I suppose they impute it to my fault, of all which I pray informe your selfe of Mr Wortley and Unguah, who comes up by this canoe.
It may be you may think I am passionate, but I am sattisfied I have just reason to complaine, but to conclude I hope you will by first conveyance be pleas'd to answer my request as far as the Castle affords, and if the George sloop doe not arrive time enough, then by some other convenient vessell, that she may returne up with account of what state we are in.
I am in great want of white men, haveing only my selfe, Mr Wortley and Mr Smith, and here should be 6 at least. If you please to send any down lett them be good men that will not dey [= die] with laziness. I here Samuell Chambers was comeing, I think he may doe well for own [= one]; since the writeing I have an ill carrecter of Samuell Chambers. What I cant think of to write Mr Wortley will give your Honour to understand. What goods will be sent down, if any is not packt up I desire they may be put up in sheet chests, and will pay the warehouse keeper for them if they are at the accustomed price, which was halfe an angle per chest, then if their be 40 or 50 chests I shall gladly pay for them.
Captain Woodfine is above halfe slaved and doubt not but he will be compleated in less than ten dayes more. The Orange Tree is arriv'd and I hope will be dispatcht in a month or 5 weeks time at farthest, but he also hath a shorte cargo. I should be glad to se Mr Winders computement of the cargo of these two ships that are the Company[s] own, for I can not understand how he makes it outt.
I want to se Cabo Corso my selfe to discourse fully of mine own business,

which I hope shall accomplish some small time. In the intrim refer you to Mr Wortley and to your own serious consideration of what I have write.
PS. Since now you may perceive I cannot send up but once a year, if you have not the conveniency of sending down a small vessell please to order down canomen with positive comands to return, that you may have a better account of affaires here.

Our carpenter is not yett in a condition to work, and I feare hee will continue soe for a while, wherefore unlesse he amends before the vessell goes from hence, cannot send him on board to ca[u]lk her. Our slaves being few in number, and them none the best, have had work enough, notwithstanding the assistance they have had from the Townes people, in bringing on shore the goods, shells and bricks abovementioned, and it is more then they can doe to bring wood and water to the Fort for our owne use, wood to burne our lyme with, water for mixing it, besides working it with swish, and makeing it fitt for use, alsoe a great deale of other worke, which they are every day about, wherefore unless you will please to send 6 lusty slaves more to abide here, I can make but very little progress towards finishing our Fort, much more be able to cutt the tymber & wood you expect, for I must needs say there is now almost as much occasion for the slaves you sent for from hence as ever, the country people beeing a rowsawing. and therefore not able to give us that encouragement, it being a great while since they have had anything given them more than a little liquor, which they doe not vallue, wherefore I desire you will please to furnish mee with a piece of red or blew [= blue] cloth that I may give to such as I finde deserveing and promoters of the Royall Companyes interest. I gave them the answer you wrott mee concerning their customes, with which they were not contented, saying it would be a great charge for them to goe for Cabo Corso, and that you might deferr finishing the Fort as long as you pleased, wherefore if it should bee your pleasure to lett mee know what you thought it necessary to allow them, I could make an agreement (on the Royal Company and your behalfe) injoyning them on such considerations to which services may bee advantageous to ditto Companys interest, and send you, which I beleive might bee very instrumentall in bringing a trade that may help to defray the charges of building This place will also require a linguist who may bee serviceable in procureing trade, which they of Occady and Butteroe are not without, wherefore am apt to beleive my endeavours to bring some here in little tyme will take effect, provided you will grant your assistance and some thing to send as a dashee to such great men in the country as wee must be beholding to for them.

1715,3,77,Richard Jennings,Dixcove,,Cape Coast Castle,14,Fort,RAC,"Since my arrivall I have been much aflicted with the stone & still continues. As did advise your Worships in a letter of the death of Mr Jordan, Mr Pinck & self have taken inventory what belonging to the Royall African Company & of Gorings estate, the which I here inclosed send your Worships, also what papers I have found. As for the perpetuanoes that are wanting, Peter, a Black in the towne, declares he brought traders some small time before Mr Goreing deceased that bought seventy, and the said Goring gave him a niconee & the trader a carpet to encourage them, & Francis Nixson declares that he saw thirty perpetuanoes deliver'd, & Mr Goring should say that was the remaines of the blue perpetuanoes. One lead barr he cutt into sluggs & gave the blacks with powder to burne Canconnock[s] croome. One half firking tallow he sold Peter, it being damaged, for 2a 6ta. I have examined the Serjeant & the men, who will all declare upon oath not the least thing of the Company has been deliver'd out of the warehouse from the death of said Goring till Mr Jordan & Mr Pinck came. I should have sent the serjeant downe, but he is troubled with a violent feavour & ague, & his leggs so swelled that he is scarce able to goe, and most of the men downe with other distempers, & provision so scarce that they are ready to starve. As to the Serjeant[s] paper [it] was a coppy taken from said Goring, & [he] further declare he did not know what goods was in the warehouse. As for the differences in the inventory, Mr John Pinck has disposed of some goods which he will give your worships accompt. I have further inquired after Mr Gorings estate, & am inform'd he sent two canoes with perpetuanoes to Cabo Corso Castle and consign'd them to the French Doctor, they were bought out of the interloper. Mr Goring was to pay 8mks, the French Doctor the ballance, the whole amounting to 15mks, but what returns was made I cannot learn. Further he laid out with the interloper 11oz in Cabe de Verde cloaths. What I have write concerning the Royall African Company & said Goring in the foregoing part of this letter is the best information I can give at present. Here are severall palavers about Harry the Bomboy, and the people are soe disattisfied with him that they are resolved never to bring trade to the fort till he is remov'd, soe shall keep him till further orders. The reason detaining the canoe so long was by seas being soe bad that noe canoe could goe off. When the seas being abated, intending to forward the canoe, [I] had information the Mine did panjard all the canoes that was belonging to Cabo Corso Castle. The reason which gave me to suspect it [was that] the canoe we sent to advise your Worships of the death of Mr Jordan is not returned. I have received yours of the 3d of May, & accordingly have sent away the five hand canoe with John Pinck. We have had for these eight days last past such violent rains that one of the flanckers is downe, & the rest I believe will falow [= follow] if the rains hold. The reason that I have not sent anything that belong to Mr Goring is because they will take damage, so shall referr it till forther orders. I humbly desire your Worships for God sake to send another person to take care of the Companys concerns, that I may come to Cabo Corso and not lye & perish here, for there is noe sustanance to be had. Being forced by my sickness to omitt severall things, shall referr you to the bearer.

2724,3,1086,Nicholas Buckeridge,Winneba,,Cape Coast Castle,20,Fort,RAC,"I have nothing of novelties to advise you, having no certaine accompt of the Aquamboers. The fear which these people are in of them furthers me much in providing shell & stone, of both which I hope to have a large stock, that soe soon as the weather breaks up may regaine this lost time, but wish you could lett me have a carpenter if it were but only for a month, both to direct as alsoe to assist this black fellow, who is willing to worke but hath not that forecast in him to lay the beams and contrive the staircase. For bricklayers, considering your necessities, shall not press, only desire that when the dry times come in you would lett one that is a workeman come downe for 10 dayes to looke upon the flankers, which I formerly advised you was afraid had received damage. As for Johnson whome I sent up, being lame, he may doe very well where there is other workemen, but wants as much directions as any blackman here, wherefore cannot rely on his judgement, and if I had my desire should rather have his roome than his company, he being such a quarrelsome fellow [to] both whites & blacks. By this conveyance you will receive my accompts, which I have moderated as much as in me lyes, but doubt not in two months or three to bring them lower, for which reason I have discharged one of the free bricklayers, being but one indifferent workeman and very lazy. I assure you it would be much to my satisfaction could I find out any way to lessen the Company charge, knowing very well it would redound to my creditt, which in this world is the cheif staff I rely on, but the many countrys I have to please and withall the ill principalls [= principles] of the inhabitants considered, may I hope be a sufficient reason of my non abillity. It hath and doth give me noe small trouble to keep a union amongst them, for should they fall out and the Acroms joyne with the Aquomboers, which said [i.e. Aquomboe] King hath tryed all ways to effect, the Aquomboers would attempt to beate us from hence. The Anguina & Wynnebah Cabbosheers are prepareing to go up to Acrom to take their fetich to be true to them and assist one another against all enimies. The Acromes have been here and taken theirs. They are desirous I should goe along with them, but I have putt it off and shall only send Captain Quo and one anchor of rumm. Soe soon as I can gett the carpenters worke finished shall runne up the front and two flankers and cover them with all expedition, which being effected shall not fear any of their palavers, it affording sufficient lodging for all our white men,
were we twenty, and with one or two carpenters more may be finished in two months. You may have your carpenters againe in less time, for after they have laid the first floor this black fellow with their directions I hope may be able to lay the roofe. I have been to see some trees which are to bigg to bring down whole, but would make good joices had I a two hand saw, and are not soe farr off but that may gett them downe without much trouble or charge. Soe soon as I have the saw shall sett the sawyers to worke, the weather beginning now to open. I have not a naile in the Factory upon what occasion soever, which pray supply me with by the first opportunity, of severall sorts.
The ballance, being 4oz 8a 4t, I send not up by this conveyance, it being a strange canoe, and besides am so plagued with interlopers since the Danes being at Accra, who they say brings a commission to take all interlopers of what nation soever, that I know not whether shall take one cra cra of money before pay day. They sell their sheets to the Negroes att 12 & 13 for 8 angles, and the rest of their goods much att this rate. If any opportunity offers of sending downe hither you may supply me with four bales of perpetuanoes more, they being goods they have not aboard, but I am in no hast of them, by reason have one bale by me not opened, besides loose ones.
PS I am heartily sorry to hear of Mr Platts & Mr Ronans indisposition but hope the worst is past.
Be pleased to send by the canoe Johnson went up in some shott, threed & twine.
By the aforegoing have given you an accompt of my wants, which if possible supply me with, for the bricklayers will have rune themselves out of worke before I can gett the joices laid. Since have received yours of the 13th & 17th instant, the contents of which I shall be very carefull to observe, makeing it my cheifest care to keep a fair correspondence with the blacks.

Tomorrow shall send the other canoe & dispatch her from thence if possible, there being so many canoes there for come makes me afraid they will not performe their promisse. I have this day turned away seven or eight canoes which came hither for come & offerd 3a per chest.
